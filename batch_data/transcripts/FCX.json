Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to over to Miss Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead ma'am. Kathleen L. Quirk: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we would like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. On the call today are, Jim Bob Moffett, our Chairman of the Board, Richard Adkerson, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Flores, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas and we have members of \u2013 senior team members in the room with us today. I will start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who will be using the slide presentation to review our performance and outlook. After our comments, we will open up the call for questions. Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $510 million, or $0.49 per share for the first quarter of 2014, which compared with $648 million or $0.68 per share for first quarter of 2013. Our first quarter results were negatively impacted by lower sales from Indonesia, attributable to the regulatory ban on concentrates imposed in mid-January and to lower copper prices. We benefited from strong operating performance from the oil and gas business, and from our Americas and Africa mining operations, which partly offset the unfavorable impacts. The consolidated first quarter copper sales of 0.8 billion pounds were about 9% below last year's first quarter, primarily as the result of the deferral of exports from Indonesia, which reduced or deferred our copper and gold sales by approximately 125 million pounds of copper and 140 ounces of gold. We are engaged in discussions with the Indonesian government to work to resume exports as soon as possible. Our first quarter sales of oil and natural gas totaled 16.1 million barrels of oil equivalence, which was above our recent forecast. The first quarter average recorded copper price of $3.14 per pound was below last years first quarter $3.51, and gold prices at $1300 per ounce were 19% below the year ago quarter. Oil prices remained strong during the quarter, with Brent prices averaging $108 per barrel. The average realization by our oil and gas division was $99 per barrel before the impacts of derivative contracts. During the quarter, we generated operating cash flows of $1.2 billion, that was net of about $400 million, in working capital uses, and our capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $1.6 billion. We ended the quarter with total debt of $20.9 billion, and our consolidated cash position was $1.4 billion. I'll now turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the presentation materials. Richard C. Adkerson:  Thanks Kathleen. Good morning, everyone. Looking at Page 3 you can see the cover of our new annual report, which we're just now beginning to distribute. It's got a band of a depiction of our resources like a rising sun coming over the earth, which I think is a good way of thinking about our company. We have this great long line of geographical diverse set of assets. At today's commodity, prices you'll see that across our set of assets we have really strong margins, in both our mining and oil and gas business, and that generates good cash flows. We have, of course, exposure to what we believe will be improving markets for commodities over time. And in addition to that we have the opportunity to grow volumes through our production profile. We've got good strong exploration leverage, both in the mining business through our Brownfield expansions and in the oil and gas business where we have Brownfield type growth opportunities from exploration, as well as Greenfield in the deepwater and in our gas exploration play. We'll be talking about that. Our company is financially strong, and we've got a great team to do things in the right way. We're experienced, and we manage our environmental responsibilities and our community responsibilities in the right way. All through 2013 and going into 2014, our code word for our company has been execution. And we have assets that we can benefit from if we execute our plans well, and we have another quarter where we've done that. We had solid performance in our mining operations in the Americas and Africa. We're going to talk about the restrictions that we have currently on our sales from PT Freeport Indonesia, because of these government export regulations. But we benefited from a very meaningful contribution from the oil and gas business. This is our third full quarter of operations after closing the transaction in June of last year, and the oil and gas business had strong operating and financial performance during the quarter. We also will report that we've advanced our growth projects. The Morenci expansion expected commissioning startups in this current quarter. The Cerro Verde expansion is construction as well in progress towards the 2016 startup. The Lucius development Deepwater Gulf of Mexico project has its first oil expected to be produced in the second half of this year and then we have very positive results from the exploratory results at our Highlander prospect in offshore in South Louisiana that Jim would be talking about. Financially, our financial results were affected of course by the we're going to call deferral of volumes as a result of this Indonesian this pending resolution of the Indonesian export situation. That reduced our volumes in the first quarter by about 525 million pounds of copper and 140,000 ounces of gold. So other than that, if you look at our actual volumes for the quarter, we were on target with the guidance that we gave you at our last quarterly outlook. So, we\u2019ve had a situation where we\u2019re affected by that we're going to talk about it, but other than, operation performance in terms of volumes produced and cost structure was really attractive.  The situation that we have now in Indonesia is because of the government regulations that were adopted on January 12. We have had no export shipments from PT Freeport Indonesia. We are able to ship concentrate to the smelter in Indonesia that our company arranged to be constructed back in the 1990. It's operated by a company called PT Smelting, which we have a 25% equity interest in PT Smelting, the operator of the smelter is Mitsubishi. So we have adjusted our production of concentrate to align the volumes of concentrate that we're producing with the requirements that can be processed at PT Smelting. That results in our mill operating at roughly half capacity, and of course the inability to sell concentrates at full capacity does have negative financial impacts, not only to our company, but to the government of Indonesia through reduced taxes, royalties, and ultimately dividends from that. What we're doing operationally is we are putting priority on the operation of our DOZ underground mine the block caving operations, since that operation needs to continue to operate to preserve the caving activities that are part of it. We're mining lower grade material, and focusing on stripping in the Grasberg open pit. We're also doing maintenance activities so that we will be prepared to return to full operations when the government regulatory situation is resolved. To-date, we have not made significant cuts in employment. We have not had significant deferrals of our ongoing major capital projects, which are important as we look at a transition from the open pit mine at Grasberg to mining underground at the Grasberg Block Cave beneath the pit, which we're looking at roughly at the end of 2016, 2017. So essentially where we have today and you see reflected in our financial results also reflected in the benefits that government gets is maintaining basically 100% of our cost structure, but having sales at 50% or lower than the issue. We working with the government to achieve a resolution for this, the government \u2013 ministries are focused and are appear to be making progress towards reaching a resolution of it. Indonesia had last week a major election of its National Parliament and also local bodies. It was a massive undertaking, and election situation took focus away from many people in government from resolving our issue, it\u2019s also created a political context, in which resolution of some of issues is complicated, but that election is behind us. There's a presidential election in early July. We know that the government is focused on getting a resolution, and we're working to encourage them. One of the complications is that we're viewing this issue in the context of our contract of work. Our contract of work was signed in 1991. It defines our financial obligations and our operating rights there. Many in government are focusing on the 2009 mining law, which represented a change going forward in Indonesia from a contract of work environment to more of an operating license situation. The government is looking to move cal holders more to the mining law requirements, and that\u2019s part of the complications we're having in how to deal with this issue. We have reached out to the government to try to be responsive to some of their aspirations. We have indicated a willingness to develop additional smelter capacity in Indonesia in the form of where their government would provide us certain financial incentives, because the economics of building a new smelter are really unattractive within global smelter economics. We're talking potential partners, including Antam, the state owned mining company there, in terms of working with us on this project. When you see our outlook numbers Kathleen referred to, that's based on a resumption of beginning operations in May, and we're optimistic about doing that. But that is dependent on the government moving forward to change its regulations. Because currently under the regulations, we don't have the authority to export. So we need to have this authority granted, and then we'll deal with the regulations that are adopted in giving us that authority. If we are delayed any further, the deferral would result at a rate of about 50 million pounds of copper a month and 80,000 ounces of gold. Our numbers reflect beginning to operate in May that we're going sharing with you, and that we shared with you in this release. While we don't think this will continue for a long period of time, in the event that it does, we could operate as we are now physically. But economically, a continuation of this over a long period of time would require us to take actions to reduce costs. That means layoffs, and deferred capital expenditures. That's not really good for anyone. And particularly, we have a particular concern about the impact of that on our workforce of having layoffs, and on our long-term ability to realize the benefits of this ore body, both for our Company and both \u2013 and the government of Indonesia and the local community. So there would be nothing good from laying off people or deferring projects, and that's why we've deferred doing this \u2013 to this point. But we would be required to do that if this goes for a long period of time. Page 7, just reference how positive our work with the government of Indonesia at PT Freeport Indonesia has been over the last 40 years. We\u2019ve since our contract was signed in 1991, we've contributed $60 billion to the national GDP. We\u2019re 90% of the economy and the region where we operate, over 40% of the province's economy and a significant contributor to the national GNP. We have a workforce that includes employees and full-time contractors of 30,000 people. We're one of the largest taxpayers in Indonesia. As I mentioned, we were the developer of Indonesia's only copper smelter there. It produces more copper than Indonesia as a country consumes, and we've invested to date over $10 billion. As we move underground, we have a business plan that provides for additional investments of over $15 billion. We contribute significantly to the local community, including a voluntary contribution of 1% of our revenues that has provided over $600 million since that fund was started in 1996. That's an enormous social program for a relatively small population group, and we remain committed to being a positive partner with the government and with all stakeholders in Indonesia. Over the last five years, we've paid over $7 billion of direct benefits, and that is more than has been paid to Freeport-McMoRan as the major shareholder of this operation. Turning to copper markets, we saw in March a downturn in the market in the copper price. It's rebounded some since then. And there was a lot of concern when the downturn occurred about growth in China, about the existence \u2013 significant amount of copper in off exchange bonded warehouses in China, and whether that might come to the marketplace in a context of relatively low global growth. What we see though in terms of the business we're doing there now, and with what the market seems to be, is a situation of not where the copper market is being flooded by a large amount of new supplies. We're not seeing a situation of where fundamental demand has dropped off any clip. The market reaction is more dealing with issues that the margin place. The fundamental demand in China remains healthy. It's supported by consumer and infrastructure investment. And the Chinese government has talked about incentives, relatively modest but important ones, in areas where copper is consumed. The lower price is reduced the availability of scrap, and that creates more demand for copper cathodes. Market reports that some of the bonded warehouse stocks are now being purchased by China as strategic reserve. There's difference views of how much that, is but it's an indication and I think of volumes in bonded warehouses are not going to be dumped onto the market in any place.  Demand in the U.S,, where we provide over 40% of the copper wire, is improving. Our downstream customers are doing well, consumer confidence is growing. Automobile and construction continues to be positive. We have a smelter in Europe, and we're seeing an uptick in Europe from its low base, but globally, copper cathode markets are tight. Exchange and consumer stocks are at historically low levels. Scrap availability is tight, and premiums for copper cathode are strengthening globally. And if we look into the future, we continue to be encouraged by the basic fundamentals of a commodity which its use is inherently positive in terms of in developing countries, as well as uses in the economy in general, and where development of supplies and maintaining production of the existing mines is challenged. Page 9, looks at our cost structure, and this when we look and generally view at one the gas operations, you'll see what strong margins we have there, but this margin story applies to our copper business as well. First quarter, our consolidated unit cost net of byproduct credits was just over $1.50 a pound that gives us a good margin at $3 copper and of course we are positive about copper prices moving forward. You can see how that breaks down by areas. And outside of the situation in Indonesia, you can see our cost performance has been strong. Red's team in the Americas is doing a great job. Our African project is doing well. And you can see that in our distribution of our copper sales between North America, South America, and Indonesia and Africa gives us a good diversity in our copper business, and that's aided by our investments in the oil and gas business. Our Brownfield development projects are proceeding well. Cerro Verde is the big product. It's $4.6 billion current estimate. We started construction a little over a year ago, and we're on target to complete it in 2013 to add $600 million pounds of copper per year. We've incurred just under $2 billion to date. This will be the world's largest single site concentrating milling facility, and can see groundwork being completed, physical destruction started, this is a site where construction can be undertaken on a relatively low risk basis because it's at an existing site where we were already operating. Morenci is really exciting; this $1.16 billion project is being completed. Commissioning startup is expected to occur this quarter at 225 million pounds of copper $1.3 billion we've incur to-date. What is so really great about Morenci is this is a mine that people thought 10 years ago was dead, and now we've got this expansion project. We're making a lot of money there with what we already have. And we have a place where our exploration team is working hand-in-hand with our development group to give us the next stage which could be a very large scale expansion there and making Morenci one of the largest most profitable mines in the world. So it's a real excitement for this to happen here at the flagship mine in North America for the industry, and our team is very enthusiastic about it. And when you look at our copper potential around the world with what is going on with Morenci, what we have Grasberg, what we're doing with Cerro Verde, and the opportunity at El Abra in Chile, to have potential for a massive concentrator development project there. And with Tenke, which is this massive mineralization area, we have the chance to have in our portfolio five of the very largest mines in the world. And that's what we're working towards. I'll and talk about the outlook, but, Jim, turn it over to you and let\u2019s talk about our oil and gas business. And congratulations on such a great quarter for you and your team. James C. Flores: Great, Richard. Thank you. Welcome everybody to the call. This morning I want to start with Page 12, and go through the Brent LSS crude oil pricing relationship and kind of how it affects our business or how well-positioned our business really is. And you see the curve there with the green and orange on our slide 12, you can see that it's very consistent through the 10 years. Except for right at the end, where you saw \u2013 we saw a little pressure on the LLS side and the merger from the Brent. We believe that's a one-time type event with the opening of the southern leg at Keystone. We saw the tremendous crude oil inventories, the exiting cushing and going down to the Gulf Coast, namely Saint James refiners obviously took advantage of that and doubled down by having a significant amount of turnarounds, and therefore you had some downward pressure there on margins that affected a lot of margins of all upstream businesses. I refer you to the black box down below, where you can see what FM O&Gs realizations per barrel before hedges are, and you can seen in June $97 a barrel, obviously we had a fabulous quarter in the third quarter of 2013 $106, $94, $100, these are basically reflecting that same curve volatility, as well as its basis differentials, but in the first quarter of 2014, to a have a $99 differential when you have that type of rollout in basis, just shows you the resilience and positioning of our assets, also the quality of the oil that we're producing. When we talk about HLS, LLS, and Brent, we produce a significant amount of HLS crude oil in the Gulf of Mexico heavy Louisiana sweet, which basically trades at a premium to LLS. Therefore, when you see basis differential created here like on Page 12 between Brent and LLS, we are actually in excellent position to continue to sell our oil at the highest prices, and therefore reflects that $99 a barrel differential. One more thing operationally there, is we're continuing to produce more crude oil versus natural gas or liquids or condensate. And with that crude oil margin so strong in the upper 80s, then we are able to obviously continue to expand that margin, instead of contracting it to offset these market conditions. The market has since rebounded, LLS and Brent is now trading closer to in parity, and we're taking advantage of that obviously with ongoing operations. Page 13, with our oil and gas assets gives you a snapshot of our four major producing areas. California, the study producer, has continued to generate very strong returns for our invested capital, and supports underlying consistency of our $900 million of operating cash margin we had in the first quarter of about $59 a barrel margin, almost $60. Eagle Ford, we've continued to add out performance there beyond our initial curves on our tight curves for reserves and production. But an excellent job of managing our completion inventory, and continued to outperform in the Eagle Ford, and do a very good job of extracting the resources there. Our Haynesville is a significant gas resource. We continue to keep that incubated as we develop our inboard Tertiary/Cretaceous gas play. We got from your balancing act between that reservoir and the large flows we'll have coming out of our South Louisiana asset base. But the Haynesville continues to be a significant gas reserve, and when gas prices move up 90% - our margin move up 90% due to a 25%, 30% increase in gas prices certainly feels a lot better to be in the Haynesville than in years passed. Then on to the beast, the Gulf of Mexico deepwater we're continuing to outpace our production goals there. We have superior production management and reservoir management. We have offset any projected natural declines with those activities, and have actually drilled our first well in deepwater after our acquisition of the Gulf of Mexico assets back in the fall of 2013. It feels like a decade ago, doesn't it, Richard? And so the first well, the A-60 well off our Holstein platform, we have now 60 feet of gorgeous 30% porosity boxcar pay that we're going to be bringing on here in the next month. And we'll be talking about that as we flow. But it's always good when you've got a long-term campaign to try to bring on 8 to 10 of these type projects a year, about 40,000 to 50,000 barrels of oil a day for the next six years in our development plan just on those assets each year. That it's always great to get off on a good start. It's like a good drive in the first round of Augusta, it feels good getting off the number one tee box. So all is good on the operating side, and the strong cast margin that Richard was talking about as well intact and we're looking forward to good from the operating standpoint. The cash margin is detailed here on Page 14. You've got California Eagle Ford, the gas assets, and Haynesville/Madden/Other, our GOM and the consolidated where you get you to the $58.71. You can see the strong emphasis on the Gulf of Mexico, and the Eagle Ford with our strong LLS pricing there is where our top performers there, and as well as I mentioned the large increase that we had on a margin basis in Haynesville due to gas prices, and then California has continued to be to be steady around $55 a barrel. Moving on to Page 15, we were very successful in the 2014 central Gulf of Mexico lease sale. We outlaid $330 million of total high bids. We're waiting for those bids to be awarded, and it's to cover 20 blocks, and over 106,000 gross acres. Our net unrisk resource potential of 1.1 billion barrels associated with these new acreages, it's very important and added to our inventory. But it's the continued execution of the strategy we had. As we acquired these assets, we wanted to core up all the tie back opportunities to our facilities and give us our infrastructure leverage. Remember in 2013, we were very active around the Holstein area in Green Canyon. Buying leases, like we bought $6 million in 2013, the majority of these leases in 2014 were around the Mississippi Canyon, the [indiscernible] area around our Marlin, Horn Mountain and Ram Powell facility. This puts us in position to have those type of development activities I talked about by bringing that production forward through 2020 and helping drive our total production volumes in 2020, up to about 110 million barrels a year, versus where we are today at about 64 million. So, this business is intact, we have the real state. And like Richard talked about, it's execute, execute, execute, and we're very excited about having this opportunity. Just to refresh everybody, on Page 16 are those three large facilities that were producing about 65,000 barrels a day total right now, which is consistent where we've been. And that's why I was talking about the production management of offsetting any projected declines, and get we have about 250,000 barrels a day or we have 75% of unutilized capacity going forward. So to be in a unique position to have the resources under our control, under our budget, and have the infrastructure in place where we can actually execute this plan in the Gulf of Mexico without the capital outlays for facilities and things of that nature is very unique. And we're finally positioned to do that, assuming all the leases get awarded to us here this summer. Looking forward, on the near-term production growth side our Lucius Deepwater development is on time, on schedule. Our operator, Anadarko, is doing a fantastic job there. And there's always a few bumps and bruises, they make it look easy, and we really appreciate that but we're on schedule here and hopefully third quarter now as we're bringing in the world class reservoir on and deliverabilty will be impactful to our company going forward very soon. So, on the oil and gas front and the deepwater everything's moving forward. We have a lot of drilling activity coming up in the next 18 months so spirits are very high. One of the other areas that's really help and focus our capital budget and causing us to think about a long-term exciting area is our inboard lower tertiary Cretaceous activity, and it all queues on to our Highlander discovery. It's going to be easy to talk about Highlander the rest the rest of this decade and so forth, and offsets and \u2013 remember, it all started with Blackbeard and Davey Jones. Blackbeard proved that we could drill the wells, and there were sands below the salt wells. Davey Jones was one of the deepest wells in this area that not only drilled the Myascene and Oligocene, the lower tertiary, but it also drilled it our first Crestaceous well South of the Port Hudson Tuscaloosa trend that's on map 18, and north of the BP Tiber well which is about 250 miles offshore. So that two wells stratographically set up the drilling toward Highlander as we move closer to the better sands to the north, and develop not only a huge structure, but also had the reservoir characteristics that we feel is very correlative to excellent production and with our deliverability capabilities in the Gulf Coast basin and that's our Highlander discovery. So we\u2019re in the process of completing Davey Jones number two in the Crestaceous. It's in a different sand facies, carbonate facies that Highlander has. However, we want to continue learn from the Davey Jones well, and we should have that well tested here in the second quarter. We're probably a month away. Then we've got to move on to Highlander development. We have that well moving quickly toward completion in third quarter and we hope to have the Blackbeard West completion sometime in early fourth quarter. The Blackbeard West completion is key because of the laminated sands are going to tell us a lot about our Lafitte discovery that we made two years ago. And that we're purchased the leases due to expirations. And also, we've drawn a lot of correlations to a recent well we've drilled with Shell at Ran Pau, our A-11 well in the L Sand which is a highly laminated sand that made over 220 million barrels at Ran Pau. So the Blackbeard West completion is very important to understanding what the aspects of that are. And moving to the west after drilling a study well in Lineham creek, we moved the rig. We're getting ready to Farthest Gate West prospect up there in Cameron Parish and we are looking forward to the drilling results of that here in about nine months to 10 months. All-in-all, we are moving forward on development here and look forward to having a tremendous gas resource year to deliver to the marketplace starting in late 2015, 2016. Richard, with that, that's the ops update, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you. Richard C. Adkerson: Thanks a lot, Jim. On page 19, we give our update that we do every quarter for the year 2014. Again this is based on returning to normal operations at Grasberg in May. While our sales have been restricted, we have produced concentrate in the inventory and that will allow us as we coordinate future shipments to customers and our customers have been working very cooperatively with us as we go through this situation with export ban would allow us to recover much of the shortfall that we had in the first quarter. So on that basis; we are looking at 4.3 billion pounds of copper sales for 2014, 1.6 million ounces of gold, 97 million pounds of molybdenum. Dave Thornton is here, the price of moly had gone up 30% in the past month, which is positive for us and then positive outlook of 64.2 million equivalent barrels of 70% of oil. Unit cost on the basis of $1,300 gold and $10 molybdenum, we're above that right now with the $1.41 for copper, as Jim talked about, attractive unit cost for oil at $19 per BOE. At $3 copper, last quarter we were using three and a quarter, we are not predicting, we are just showing you a model here that shows operating cash flows $7.7 billion in the basis of the plan, each $0.10 change in copper for the remainder of 2014 is significant $275 million. No changes in our capital expenditure outlook of just over $7 billion. Page 20 shows our sales profile as we go forward. You can see the significant increase and volumes that come about as we bring these development projects online. 2016 is a special year, in the sense that it's our last really full year production Grasberg open pit. So we will access in that case to very high grades of copper and gold, low stripping, and that ends up with an extraordinary year particularly for gold as you can see it. An outlook for 3 million ounces, but also for copper, strong molybdenum sales, growing oil sales, as Jim talked about and with significant growth beyond 2016 oil and gas business. Our quarterly outlook is presented on slide 21. You can see increasing volumes as we go through the quarter. Gold sales at Grasberg are affected by mine sequencing, and you can see our outlook for our oil and gas business as well our molybdenum business. The outlook for site costs in the mining is presented on Page 22 based on $1300 gold, $10 molybdenum outlook for consolidate unit cost at $0.41. You can see the spread for our copper sales, we have more than 40% in North America, more than 30% in South America, roughly just over 20% in Indonesia and 10% in Africa. With our cobalt coming from Africa, our molybdenum principally from North America, and our gold from Indonesia. Our model outlook for EBITDA and cash flows is presented on Page 23. What we're showing here is an average of our 2015 and 2016 operating plans. And then with set prices with variances for copper and it's the most significant driver of our earnings and cash flow and at $3 copper EBITDA of just over $13 billion and $3.5 billion of operating cash flows, $16 billion EBITDA at $3.50 and $12.5 billion of operating cash flows. And then if copper were to average $5 during those two years, then the amounts to very significant levels $18.5 million and $14 billion. Sensitivities for your own use and developing your models are presented on Page 24. And our capital expenditures, which are unchanged from our previous outlook, are presented on Page 25. This year, there's just over $4 billion for mining, just over $3 billion of that is for the major projects, and $3 billion for oil and gas. The commitment to balance sheet management, as we've been talking about since we announced the oil and gas acquisitions, we are focused on reducing the acquisition debt. That focus is unchanged. We are dealing with lower copper prices currently. None of us know what it's going to be as we look forward. We have some headwinds currently from the Indonesian export situation. We expect that to be resolved and recover from that very quickly. But despite that \u2013 those situations, we're still looking at targeting reducing our debt to something in the range of $12 billion by the end of 2016. We anticipate continuing our current cash dividend on our common stock at $1.25 share. And we will reach this target by managing our large resource base, generating strong cash flows through execution. And being very disciplined in the way we run our business. We're continuing to work on divestiture and monetization opportunities. We're working with third-parties both in the oil and gas business and the mining business, and advancing potential transactions that would allow us to move towards our debt targets more quickly. If we run our plans without any divestitures, the story is a good one. Even at $3 copper, we get down to the range of $14 billion, even at the reduced copper level by the end of 2016. But we want to get there quicker, and we're working hard to do it. We have opportunities to do it with our asset base. We can't announce specifics today, but we can report that the management team we feel good about what we're pursuing. And we're looking at other opportunities beyond straight asset sales in terms of joint venture arrangements potential, MLP opportunities focusing in on our California properties, which would be very attractive for the MLP market. So all of those things are at work, and the story today is there's no wavering in our commitment to get to where we need to get to have a strong balance sheet. So that's our report for this quarter. Some challenges, but that's the nature of our business. We've been there before, and we've met them, and we'll meet these. And we look forward to answering your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line David Gagliano with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. David Gagliano \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks to be first up. Let me just ask you a couple quick questions on Grasberg please. First of all on the commentary regarding the contingency plans you mentioned more workforce reductions capital spending reductions what's a reasonable time period to expect for the start of these contingency plans. Is this something we should expect to start to occur in Q2, Q3 or next year? Richard C. Adkerson: Well, Dave, what would drive that is not anything that's from a timing standpoint forces us to do it. So long as we feel as we do now that we're moving towards resolution issue. Then we will not go through the negative impacts of having workforce reductions and capital difference that's where we've been so far. If there were to be something happening within the government that would lead us to conclude at any point in time that they're just going to leave the situation in place for a long period of time that\u2019s when we would act.  So we believe this is going to be resolved in the relatively near future that there's progress being made that people are working towards a resolution and we would only act if we got word from the government \u201chey were not going to do anything were just going to leave is in place.\u201d So it's not a specific time but more a reading of the progress that\u2019s being made towards resolution. David Gagliano \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That\u2019s helpful, thanks. And then just somewhat related the rate of deferral months that went \u2013 I think it\u2019s now indicating 15 million pounds deferred volume each month that you're unable to export concentrates. I\u2019m just curious why do that deferral rate increase I think it was 40 million pounds a month? Kathleen L. Quirk: Yes, David this is Kathleen. We're just getting into some higher grade potential and so that just reflects that the gold is the same as what we had said before, but the copper is a little higher impact. David Gagliano \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: What we did, Dave, when this first started is we moved out of the lower region pit and started focusing on mining at the higher areas where we had with material. All of these are things were going to have to do over time in our mine plan. So we mine higher grade material \u2013 I mean lower grade material, waste lower grade material but some and stockpiles and now just because of mine sequencing we end up getting into some higher grade material. David Gagliano \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Perfect. I got it. Why don't I hop out? Thanks for taking the questions and good quarter by the way. Richard C. Adkerson: Thanks a lot Dave. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your question. Richard C. Adkerson: Hey Tony. Operator lets go to\u2026 Tony B. Rizzuto \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC: Hello. Richard C. Adkerson: Tony, are you there? Tony B. Rizzuto \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes, I\u2019m here can you hear me? Richard C. Adkerson: We can hear you now. Tony B. Rizzuto \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC: All right good, good. Wow I thought I was going to be shut off asking no question here. Richard C. Adkerson: That will never happen. Tony B. Rizzuto \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC: Congrats on a better performance and must better costs in Indonesia than we expected, especially during this very difficult time. It seems as though there was a bit of a breakthrough recently, at least in the regaining the ability to export, and this morning it looks like there's an article the Jakarta Post that indicates that the government has revised the controversial export duty and according to the Deputy Finance Minister, I guess, which is being quoted, but is the progressive export tax now no longer an issue Richard? Richard C. Adkerson: Tony let me just make a comment, and this is not just unique to Indonesia, you see it here in newspapers. As you know because you follow us over a long period of time, we did caution you about reacting to daily press releases. Comments are made by a variety of people in government and there are inconsistencies. We will keep everybody informed when there are major developments and so forth. Now we think the current export duty is prohibitive. It goes up to 60%. You just can't pay that and run your business. So when we talk about progress it is progress in the sense of dealing with this export duty and that would mean adjusting it downward. Our contract says that we pay no taxes or duties other than the ones listed in the contract, and so that\u2019s one of these issues of where people in the government are focusing on the new mining law, we are focusing on our contract and that part of the discussions that are going on. So there is progress being made, the progress would necessarily entail a dealing with the currently prohibitively high export duties, but there are no announcements that we're prepared to make today about conclusions. And when there are, we would make them, it will require the Ministry of Finance to adopt new regulations. They have not done that yet. We have had an important step in being designated as an authorized exporter by the Ministry of trade but there is several procedure steps that we have to go through to get this behind us. Tony Rizzuto \u2013 Cowen Securities LLC : Okay. Could you maybe discuss in greater detail that the complexities you guys are facing as it relates to COW extension? And then, in light of the 2009 mining law, I know there's been some there were further changes in 2012, and the government seems like it is trying to convert the COW to that new business license structure. Should I be looking at these discussions, all of these whether it be the concentrate exports, export types of smelters, as being linked, or are they separate and distinct from the COW extension discussions? Richard C. Adkerson: Okay. It\u2019s all link fundamental, but we are focusing immediately on trying to get to a point where we can export concentration returns to normal operations. That will not require dealing with all of the COW issues. We would like to see the COW issues doubt with we\u2019ve been working very actively with the government for 2.5 years doubt to do that. That\u2019s complicated in difficult to do in the current political environment. So it\u2019s a two step process, first step is to reach a basis through regulatory changes and governmental approvals so that we can resume exports get back to working in a normal way and we'll continue to have discussions on the COW extension and that's where this issue comes up of our being committed to supporting and sending our COW the government warning to move COW holders to the new regime that\u2019s define by the 2009 mining law and that\u2019s basis for our the debate. Tony Rizzuto \u2013 Cowen Securities LLC : Okay. All right and then just to switch gears a little bit here, in terms of the asset sales and in the discussion you indicated that you're actively engaged in discussions. I was wondering, does the expansion enhance long-term viability of Morenci make it more likely you guys could part with other lesser core assets in North American mining? Richard C. Adkerson: Well, that\u2019s an interesting question. We have opportunities to do that, but I think you were down in just go we can clearly unfortunate I could make it this year, but I think one of the things that comes out of there is the reality the mining industry is based. The U.S. is increasingly looking attractive for development. The energy situation here that's affecting industrial development across the board in the U.S. comes into play here in the U.S. for our mining projects. So today U.S. is a very significant advantage over expansions in South America because of the cheaper energy here. We\u2019re also seeing increasingly the benefits of the U.S. workforce. We are nonunionized here. We have a very flexible workforce where it's easier to staff up for expansions and then adjust if you have to adjust than in South America where you have unions and government policies that make it difficult to flex your workforce. Water is an issue in the United States, but Red and his group have done a great job in securing water opportunities for us here in Arizona. Water is a huge, huge problem in Chile, and that ties into energy because of having to use desile projects that requires a lot of energy to pump the water and run the projects. So when we size things up we are increasingly encouraged about opportunities to expand U.S. and more than half of our resources now are in the U.S. So in any event, this Southwest copper district has rolled away the stone from the tomb. And you know and it\u2019s looking really good for us. And so what we wouldn't want to do is sell assets that have significant growth opportunities because we're so positive about the long-term future for copper work and we have that in the U.S. Tony Rizzuto \u2013 Cowen Securities LLC : That makes a lot of sense. I think that I appreciate the insights. And yes, I did miss you at CESCO there, Richard Richard C. Adkerson:  Yeah, I missed you too, Tony. All right. Thanks a lot. If you we'll let you get back in line. Tony Rizzuto \u2013 Cowen Securities LLC : Yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. Richard C. Adkerson: Thanks. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs :  Thank you. Good morning guys. Richard C. Adkerson: Good morning Sal. Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs :  Wanted to just ask you if your current labor force, you are still keeping them \u2013 my understanding is that they are doing maintenance work pre-stripping. Does it imply that the future cost could be better if once these things as all the preparation work is being done right now? Richard C. Adkerson: Well the answer is yes. I mean our cost structure in large part is fixed. We do have some variable cost, but we have a lot of fixed cost so obviously we get volumes back up you don\u2019t see the unit cost come down, but we are getting ahead of the curve as you mentioned some stripping activities and maintenance activities and that will have some benefits that the margin as we go forward. Getting those volumes is forwards that's where we are making money, because have to touch our margins and we just need to get the shipments going to our customers outside Indonesia. Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs :  Got you. And, Richard, is there any difficulty or concern if you reach an agreement and the new government comes in they may have a different view again, is that also hampering the discussion or are you confident that whatever deal you make or whatever solution you make with the current government will actually be honored by the next government? And we have seen Indonesian government have what they have done with their COW, and change the rules during the game. And if there's a concern that it may happen again, even after the resolution with the current government. Richard C. Adkerson: Listen we\u2019ve been there for over 40 years. You think about the huge concerns that we\u2019re there from the unknowns that happens when Suharto stepped down in 1998. And the government has evolved since then, and the government will continue to evolve in Indonesia as a lot of places in the world there's a lot of nationalistic political views that's popular with the local population. It really comes into play with natural resources and that's just something we have to do with so the answer is we're going to be dealing with this issue forever and we've had experience with it, there's a lot of reasons for whoever \u2013 the basic issue for Indonesia is this, Indonesia has grown so much and has developed over the 25 years that I've been going there. They still have a growing young population with a lot of unemployment. And while there local economy has developed they need to create jobs, any political leader that comes in from whatever party is going to be faced with the necessity of creating jobs, are there going to be \u2013 are they going to fail. And they to create jobs Indonesia does not have an internal savings rate that's enough to fund the capital investment to create jobs. So their going to need foreign investment and regardless of nationalistic views or feelings about self-sufficiency which you hear a lot today in Indonesia the reality is people there is around the world people face is creating jobs to the young people and in Indonesia and that's going to require foreign investment and that's going to require Indonesia to be part of the world economy and that's the reality. We stay out of politics. The people of Indonesia choose the kind of government they want to have and we don't try to influence that. We prepare ourselves to work with whatever government the people elect. Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: I did understand the smelter is going to create 500 jobs, and if you shut half the mine down, that's going to will cost 15,000 jobs to go away. Richard C. Adkerson: We\u2019ve had those discussions, you can be sure that those discussions are made. Part of the problem that\u2019s complication, I'm sure as you know, Sal, is this was originally directed at other minerals. Where Indonesia is world's largest of nickel ores, I think they provide two thirds of the bauxite to China, significant tin exports and as those industries where they were just exporting ores, Indonesia was see value creation going to other countries that\u2019s not what it is for copper, but politically we are in a complicated situation in trying to say treat copper in a company like Freeport different than you are treating the small nickel exporters and that\u2019s a tough political situation for the government to be in, but yes we\u2019ve made that point and you are right. Sal Tharani \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you, I\u2019ll get back in the front queue. Richard C. Adkerson: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Curt Woodworth with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question. Curt Woodworth \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.: If you can expand on the asset sale potential, I think in the past, company has talked about potential of $3 billion to $4 billion in asset sales and then specifically with regards to California, as you're thinking in the MLP opportunity that you would want to divest that to an existing MLP or potentially create your own? James C. Flores: This is Jim. Regarding asset sales, we're looking and exploring all options. The LMP study and discussion we've been having internally is basically maximizing the value of our onshore oil assets. They're long lived, they're low decline, they're the prototype MLP asset in the investment banker and any of your firms will come tell you that aspect of it, but the key is, and foremost, what does it do for the FCX shareholder? And as Richard and Kathleen talked about our balance sheet discipline and with high oil prices, gives us an opportunity to transfer some of that value from the assets themselves to the FCX to shell to form a debt repayment. That being said, we still want to maximize our oil business because of the high margins and the growth. And what we're seeing, this is going to be a long-winded answer to your MLP question, but what we're seeing in the Gulf of Mexico is all the growth potential we have, all the development activity, and the ability to grow that business much faster. So we're in the early stages of getting our hands around rotating out of our onshore oil business at the highest value possible. And the MLP might be a vehicle to do that either internally, or sell, or a joint venture with it existing MLPs, or just sell outright those assets. And monetize those assets, and help accelerate the Gulf of Mexico. What we've found in our modeling is that we can grow faster in the Gulf, and hit the same targets by monetizing the onshore assets and rotating into the offshore business. The MLP discussions or valuations are going to be one part of doing that successfully, because of the valuations for those assets. The current headwinds in the MLP market are severe, with the banks exiting the hedging market and the severe backwardation. You've got 20% to 25% backwardation in the crude oil curve over the next 36 months, yet you've got oil demand never stronger, it's up 1 million, 1.5 million barrels a day worldwide with 3% GDP growth. So there's going to be continued headwinds to doing a traditional MLP of just hedging the oil volumes, levering it up, and selling it to another set of investors. At the same point in time, these properties are to be around for a long, long time. So what you could see is the next several years is us rotating that business, continue to use the excess sales proceeds to reduce the balance sheet, as well as rotate to higher growth assets in the Gulf of Mexico. And the $3 billion to $4 billion target that we've all talked about is going to be underpinned by that activity as well as anything on the mining side. Richard C. Adkerson: Here's where it comes together. Here's, fundamentally, where we\u2019re approaching the oil and gas business in the mining business the same from this perspective. We\u2019re big believers in the future of the commodities we\u2019re big believers in the future of growth through our set of assets. So we are looking to enhance that. That's where we can grow. And looking at our other assets which have value and are good assets that we might could monetize through sales joint venture MLP and reach this debt target. But we've not as I mentioned in the response to Tony, we don't want to sell assets that takeaway from our future growth opportunities. In fact, we want to look for ways to enhance those assets. So we got \u2013 we got those opportunity across the board. And, Curt, we're just not at the point where we are discussing to specifically what we are doing, but our targets remain the same and we are optimistic about achieving them. Curt Woodworth \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay and that's very helpful, and I appreciate it. And just a follow-up on Indonesia, it seems like one of the key points the government is trying to make is to get companies to adhere to obviously the new licensing agreements that you guys stated. And I think that for most companies operating under those IUPs, is there's a mandatory investment process. Whereas, after five years, you have to start divesting your ownership stake, and I think by year 10 it's below I think 51%. And I was wondering is this going to affect your view towards capital allocation going forward at Grasberg? Obviously, there's a substantial CapEx swing as you go underground. And do you have confidence that you'll be able to effectively uphold the existing terms that you have regarding your ownership stake? Richard C. Adkerson: Okay, you're right about the IUP. We have a contract of work, and under that contract we have no divestiture obligations. As we've talked before, what we\u2019re trying to do is to sit down with the government. Finally, that we can do response to certain of their aspirations and voluntarily change the contract without throwing it out the window and abandoning it as way of protecting our interest. For example, with divestitures, we think if we as part of an agreement to extend the contract and resolve all these issues related to the review of the contract and the mining law, that for us to list an interest of PT-FI on the Indonesian exchange would be positive for all parties. Positive for the government, and positive for us. So that's the sort of thing that we\u2019re talking about doing. But as I mentioned earlier, the challenges of our debate is this issue you raised with the government wanting to go more in the direction of the 2009 mining law, we wanting to extend the contract, and trying to reach agreement on that during an election year where all the politics are volatile. So, that's why we're focusing first on getting back to work with our exports, and continuing the discussions on the contract beyond that. If we could resolve the whole issue, then we'd do it, we want to do it. But we\u2019ve got to face the realities of where we are in the context of Indonesia today. Curt Woodworth \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.:  Okay, thank you. Richard C. Adkerson: But let's go back to your deal, we are confident we're going to be able to have a resolution of this. So we continue our underground development, so we can operate there through 2041 in a very profitable low cost way. This has changed our view about exploration outside of PT-FI. And looking at other places in Indonesia, unfortunately for the country, this new mining law is making it very difficult to doing new projects there in the mining business. And so, we have backed off of some of our exploration opportunities that we were pursuing because of the new mining law that doesn\u2019t\u2019 apply to PT-FI. Curt Woodworth \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Profiti with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. Ralph Profiti \u2013 Credit Suisse : Indonesia, perhaps for Kathleen, I'm wondering how Indonesia may affect liquidity decisions in the next say six months. We saw a net cash draw down in the quarter, and which bringing the cash balance down. While between substantial lines of credit available, the dividend, CapEx, and as Indonesia and as all things come together, how is that strategy, if any, likely to change over the next six months as it pertains to liquidity? Kathleen L. Quirk:  Well as we've been talking about our current plan is that we'll be able to resume normal exports in the second quarter and obviously what we have contingency plans as well that the deal with the situation is extended. We're not currently expecting that but we do have contingency plans. As you point out we would you have a very large undrawn revolver and do have cash on hand, but we'll manage the situation, we'll manage our outflows, we'll manage our CapEx all to maintain a very strong liquidity position. Ralph Profiti \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay, thank you. And my second question is maybe a little bit more of housekeeping. There was $0.49 per pound that was excluded in the site production costs at PT-FI. And I'm just wondering, is that related to the increased rate of voice [ph] stripping? If we can have a little bit of discussion on what's actually in that $0.49. Kathleen L. Quirk: Yes. Those were cost that were charged roughly the cost of sales rather than going through the normal process of going through inventory and then into cost of sales as a concentrated sold. What we did and this is consistent with accounting rules when you're not operating at normal levels, you need to keep your inventory balances at what they would otherwise would have been. So during the quarter, we incurred those costs that were outside because we didn't have volumes in inventory as those went to directly to cost of sales, but they were just the normal cost of operations it just was excess of what our normal inventory values would be have we been operating at normal capacity. Ralph Profiti \u2013 Credit Suisse : I see. Okay, thank you very much. That's clear. Richard C. Adkerson: It was explained as the cost of excess capacity to me I mean for example, if we could next port anything or couldn't ship anything we charge all the cost that were incurring directly as an expense of having excess capacity and this is the element of excess capacity that we have. Ralph Profiti \u2013 Credit Suisse : Thank you. That's very clear. Richard C. Adkerson: Ralph, I\u2019m glad you called Kathleen, one of the benefits I have is she looks over my shoulders, I\u2019m making all these comments. I mentioned that the Indonesian elections were last week; they were actually April 9, just to be accurate. Ralph Profiti \u2013 Credit Suisse : Thank you. Operator : You are next question comes from the line of Tony Robson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. Tony D. Robson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets Ltd.: Thank you. good morning all and thank you Richard for taking my question. Following on from Tony's comments regarding the Jakarta Post article, and I understand your comment not to jump on the latest things you hear from Indonesia, but to reiterate it again, the comments from the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry that had talked about a flat export duty of 10%. Would a flat 10% export duty for say the next three or four years while you're building a smelter, would that be acceptable to Freeport and to PT-FI or would that be because it cuts across your contact of work as you've well pointed out, would that be an unacceptable compromise to you guys? Thank you. Richard C. Adkerson: Well I\u2019m going to repeat the caution about assigning too much weight to even specific comments that are attributed to individual government officials. So would again just suggest like I do, I read the papers every morning, every evening, but don\u2019t react specifically to what people are said or quoted as to having said. So I would just caution you about putting too much weight on that. But you do touch on an important issue for us and other contract work holders, is that whatever the rate is if one is imposed it would be contrary to the contract provision to say that were only subject to taxes that are identified work. We have urged the government if they do impose a rate, to treat it as an income tax payment, and have it credible against income taxes as an offset to income taxes. And that way our taxes would be limited to what is in the contract. We recognize that that might be difficult for the government to implement. So what we will be faced with is how to deal with this, I mean we have a strong incentive about going back to work, principally to avoid harm to our workers in the local community, we can manage this ourselves financially for the company. But we will have to work with governmental how we deal with this conflict and how it preserves our rights for the contract and we're just going to have way to see with the regulations are before we respond specifically to that. So Tony I'm sure you can appreciate we can\u2019t speculate on that right now until we see what comes out of the government. Tony Robson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : I understand, and thank you for that, Richard. Richard C. Adkerson: Okay. Thanks Tony. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question. Oscar Cabrera :  Good morning everyone. First of all, congratulations on the strong results. We're starting to get used to oil and gas exceeding expectations, so hopefully that can be kept up. Just want to start first with a clarification. During your remarks, Richard, you mentioned that at $3 copper you expected the net debt to be down to $14 billion. Does that imply that you expect to get about $2 billion in the monetization of whatever the case may be joint ventures or asset sales? Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch :  Good morning everyone. First of all, congratulations on the strong results. We're starting to get used to oil and gas exceeding expectations, so hopefully that can be kept up. Just want to start first with a clarification. During your remarks, Richard, you mentioned that at $3 copper you expected the net debt to be down to $14 billion. Does that imply that you expect to get about $2 billion in the monetization of whatever the case may be joint ventures or asset sales? Richard C. Adkerson: No. And that's based on a model of just running our business and achieving our production volumes and cost and based on $3 copper and $1300 gold and $10 molybdenum and oil prices being roughly at where they are today. So the point out was making is even though we've had the drop in copper prices, we still have a very strong business of generating cash flows at today\u2019s prices. Now, if prices weaken or costs go up or we have production disruptions, one of the reasons we want to derisk the balance sheet by advancing these sales and get all this debt talk behind us. But if in fact we have other headwinds deal with which in our business, might have that. We always have the flexibility of reducing capital spending, particularly in the oil and gas business as we talked about before much more so in the mining business, you can deferred capital spending and cut back its more discretionary. You don't lose resources by doing that as you know Oscar, because you\u2019ve been there very tough for us to back off of Cerro Verde now given where we are with our oil and gas capital spending. We have more flexibility if we were to have to adjust capital spending. So but my only point was we haven\u2019t run off any clip year from our basic operating situation and we still have a strong business, because of our margins at today\u2019s copper prices and commodity prices. We still generate lot of cash is going to be back end loaded, because of our capital spending and the fact that we get the benefit of volumes after the capital projects are finished. But even with that backend loaded and copper prices coming off of $3.30 to over $3 now. We still have a very strong outlook. James C. Flores: And, Oscar, I was reiterating the fact that the Gulf of Mexico as we get further into this we're getting more comfortable with it. We're getting some of the planning and volatility we're starting to see success and results and so forth, and it's really allowing us that more flexibility, as Richard said, to support the aspect of strengthening the balance sheet. And at the same point in time, growing \u2013 have a dynamically growing world business to support their long corporations growth long-term. So, as we\u2019re growing to this process it\u2019s nothing like a little low copper prices to make you refine the business strategy and look at things in a different way. And I think it\u2019s going to positive results and everybody that's been involved in the situation and asked stepped up the execution on the operations front has responded. I am just continue to be pleased with our ability to work in tandem to the corporate goals, and at the same point in time ring out some operating excellence and flexibility in each and every business here. And we expect that continue. Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Thank you both. Not questioning the strength of the operation whatsoever. It's more like if you're building a new smelter refinery in Indonesia, then just want to gauge the flexibility on that net debt target. Because the expenditure of $3.5 billion or $4 billion over there, and I know you probably get a joint venture partner, it would be a different story. But anyway, second question\u2026 James C. Flores: Let me make clear on that, just to be specific Oscar. That doesn't include that kind of spending in Indonesia. We are talking with partners, and we also talk with government, about the need I have government incentives to deal with part of that cost. But that's not in the numbers that I talked about. With that something that would have to be dealt with. But there's several moving parts right now. Richard C. Adkerson:  Oscar send label get free of way of the partner. Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Well, we're talking to the wrong guy though. Sorry, and then in the spirit of educating the mining guy, your oil and gas sales projections for 2016, and at the end of the of the year you said 81 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2016. Now we're looking at 78 million. And I'm guessing this is just deferral, but could you just go over where the change was or what's causing that reduction? Kathleen L. Quirk: Oscar this is Kathleen. As Rich will notice we move some production into 2014 we\u2019re previously saying $61 million BOEs and our $64 million and we have move some of the plan shut ins into 2015 and then moved some from 2015 into 2016. So, that's affected the volumes, but that's really what's driving and I think you'll see getting some volumes excelerated to do what we can to offset some of the shortfalls we've had in the mining business. James C. Flores:  Right, and Osacar and the shutting she's talking about are the platform modifications so we can bring on incremental production from the tie backs. As we again thinking about the business everyday and making sure we are making the best decisions that made operational sense to group all those together at the end of 2015 and first quarter of 2016 and so there is so affected production, it wouldn\u2019t be individual well its just timing of us 45 days shut ins for each one of those make in facilities/ Richard C. Adkerson: And this worth pointing out that these facilities were acquired from BP and Shell in the fall of 2012. So the team is learning more and getting experienced with it so changes in this range Oscar are just to be expected. I mean there's nothing that's significant about it as Kathleen said, its just we try to give you an outlook every quarter and outlooks are going to change. Oscar Cabrera \u2013 Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch :  No, I appreciate that, Richard. Thank you all. And it is just again, educating the mining guy. Thanks very much. Richard C. Adkerson: You are making a lot of progress Oscar; we don\u2019t keep working with you. Operator : Your next question comes from the lines of Paretosh Misra with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with you question. Paretosh Misra \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC:  At Grasberg, I see that the mill operating rate declined versus the last quarter, but what about the mining rate, did that remain pretty much unchanged, so you just basically did more stripping? Richard C. Adkerson: It did it was in the range of changes it was down a little bit, our mine rated downward DOZ mine, which is at relatively full capacity is still 50,000 instead of 65 or 70, so we are making some adjustments to that and listen somebody mentioned earlier Mark Johnsons here, those guys have done a great job. We completed our labor contract last fall. We've had a harmonious situation working. We\u2019ve had a good safety performance in the first quarter which was big concern and focus of our company after the experiences over the last couple of years, but the team has worked very well together; we appreciate the support of our union and our workers so we've tweaked it Paretosh. It's down slightly but we are continuing to operate at essentially full mining rates. Paretosh Misra \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And maybe a quick one for Jim, it could be a question similar to Oscar's question. For the second half of 2014, third quarter guidance is up, but fourth-quarter is unchanged. Anything major that's driving that? James C. Flores: Yes, that was what Kathleen talked about. We had previously planned to shut our Marlin facility down for the entirety of the third quarter of 2014. We've now shift that to the third quarter of 2015. So that's between 30,000 and 40,000 barrels a day that will be on stream here in the fourth quarter, and add to those volumes and those numbers. Paretosh Misra \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you very much. Richard C. Adkerson: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos' Very Independent Research. Please go ahead with your question. John Tumazos \u2013 John Tumazos' Very Independent Research : Thank you very much for all your efforts resolving the issues overseas, and the patient deliberations on the refinancing. I'm a small shareholder and appreciate your hard work. Some of Jim's comments about the oil and the gas properties went over my head. Could you explain the unrisked potential, is that before a feasibility study saying what's recoverable? And could you elaborate a little bit about the Highlander discovery and its relationship to Davey Jones and Blackbeard and the deep output potential please? James C. Flores: Sure, John. On page 15, you're talking about the green box in our slide saying Total Net Unrisked Resource Potential of 1.1 billion BOE, barrels of oil equivalent. That was respective to the blocks, the new tracks and new leases that we're the parent high bidder on, and are waiting to be awarded. We're trying to give everybody a feel of what we feel is the resource potential. When we start talking about putting it into a plan to be funded as a CapEx item and refining those plans, we will do it on a risk basis to make sure it's competitive with the rate of returns on a risk basis. But when you're risking 1 billion barrels of oil, you get to a big number. When you start with 1 billion barrels of oil and when you start risking, you get to a big number especially when you're talking about $10 to $15 a barrel, costs may be as low as $5 in some of these cases, some nice big reservoirs when you already have the infrastructure in place. So I appreciate your question to give you a little more. Richard C. Adkerson: Thank you. Let me say because I've talked with John so long about this. Maybe, John, what this is, this is a geologic analysis of what the opportunity is. So in the oil and gas business what the opportunity is. So in the oil and gas business what the next would be, would to do further geological analysis of the subsurface through seismic studies and so forth. But ultimately, you have to drill wells to have discoveries or not and then you delineated and then you move towards a development plan. So this is sort of like in the mining industry of having, widely space and now you have to do exploratory drilling delineation drilling and then you move towards deciding specifically how you have a development plan. That makes sense John. John Tumazos \u2013 John Tumazos Very Independent Research : Yes, that's real good. Thank you, Jim, and, Richard. And could you explain a little bit the Highlander discovery and the analogies to the other deep wells? That was a little bit fuzzy to me? James R. Moffett:  [Technical Difficulties] John Tumazos \u2013 John Tumazos Very Independent Research : Thank you very much, I can listen for hours. Richard C. Adkerson:  Thanks John. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Brian Yu with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question. Brian Hsien Yu \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.:  Great, thank. Hey Rich, I've got a couple of clarification questions. One is just on the smelter costs. I think last quarter, you guys said maybe less than $3 billion, and then Oscar earlier mentioned $3.5 billion to $ billion. I was wondering if you could just elaborate what your more recent studies or look suggests about the CapEx on a 100% basis before any government subsidies? Richard C. Adkerson: Yes. And part of it is and this is just to indicate what the study is the current smelter we have at Gresik is Mitsubishi technology smelter that continues casting. And new smelters that are being built in China older outokumpu type flash smelters is what we have and a version of that, an early version of that in copper and also right in our mine smelter here in United States. China which has been constructing smelters aggressively in recent years because of their internal demand for copper have advanced that technology and are building large-scale smelters using the outokumpu type flash smelting. So one of the things we're studying is different aspects of that. We had an international engineering firm do a prefeasibility type studies which was focused on the Mitsubishi type situation. That's what we talked about earlier. I think at this point and we're working with Antam which is suggesting that with Indonesia we might have beneficial labor costs, et cetera. So, it's in the range of $2 billion to$2.5 billion is the number two think about. There is some working capital issues associated with that but all of this is still within a pretty wide range of potential estimating I wont call it areas, but just estimating ranges is because of the stage of studies today. Brian Hsien Yu \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then secondly, just back to the earlier discussion about MLPs. And my understanding is that the valuations step up, a good portion of it has to do with tax savings, but you don't pay any taxes, at least at the operations level, both at the energy or on the copper side. So are there corporate tax savings that you would expect to realize from putting some assets into an MLP type structure that we should take into consideration? Richard C. Adkerson: Let me just make a couple of comments about taxes, we pay substantial foreign taxes as you know, you know where we operate. So our cash tax obligations are substantial. Not so much in the United States, particularly with oil and gas acquisition, because of some net operating loss carry forwards have transferred over and the current deductibility of intangible drilling and development costs. So the benefit is not so much to the corporation, but to the investors. In other words, the initial attractiveness of MLPs was to individual investors where you weren\u2019t faced with having taxes at a corporate level, and then taxes on dividends. It was a true partnership, so it eliminated the INU level taxes, and then the tax attributes like IDCs and so forth flow through to the unit holders, but what's happened since in the development of the MLP concept is today even a number of non-tax paying investors, institutional investors are attracted to MLPs because of the distribution aspects of it in the low interest rate environment. In other words they see distributions from MLPs providing current cash returns in relation to investment from other income yielding type vehicle. So a lot of today's investors in MLPs that are not attracted to it from the tax attribute side, its still there for individual investors, but more just from the fact that MLPs are structured in ways to give attractive current income distributions. And so that resulted in attractive multiples in the public marketplace, those are admittedly higher for what's called midstream MLPs where you have contracts to give a surety of our cash flows and upstream MLPs typically trade in lower valuations, but we have assets particularly in California that are attractive for the MLP models and it gives us opportunity to look at it. As Jim talked about, our real objective here which is maybe different from some other MLP developers is to create a monetization event, so we can meet our debt targets. We are focused \u2013 we are really focused on building value FCX shares, I mean that\u2019s what we really want to do. So the management team we are in the same views as our shareholders and we're trying to find ways as our shareholders and we are trying to find ways of increasing the value of FCX\u2019s shares. We feel they are significantly undervalued today, almost every management team you talk to if going to say that, but we believe we can by executing our plans experiencing what we believe to be favorable future markets, dealing the problems like this Indonesian problem , and strengthening our balance sheet we think ultimately that will translate into our share price. And that's what we're all working towards. Brian Hsien Yu \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Okay, great thanks Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Lipschitz with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question. David A. Lipschitz \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC :  Good morning. My quick question is, have you talked with other companies, other than the government, such as new moderns something like that about building a smelter? Are they involved in those talks as well? Richard C. Adkerson: The answer is definitely yes. We\u2019ve talk with other companies in an appropriate way about their situations and you might want to speak for themselves, but their resource is significantly different than the Grasberg resource. Always has been in particularly in terms of mine life and so forth. But I mentioned we're working with Aneka Tambang, Antam the state owned mining company in Indonesia we\u2019ve also had discussion with others and so we\u2019re opened to working with partners and have active discussion going on with them. David A. Lipschitz \u2013 CLSA Americas LLC : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Garrett Nelson with BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. Garrett Nelson \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets : : Kathleen L. Quirk: It's mainly the changes in the Grasberg volumes, and the timing of those. Richard C. Adkerson:  It's the makeup. In other words, our production of copper concentrate is higher than our sales and so we\u2019ve increased our inventory of copper concentrates which with clearance to export will work it way into the marketplace over time. So that\u2019s why we talk about the shortfall is not being lost volumes, but deferred volumes. Garrett Nelson \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. And then switching over, as you noted, the moly market has shown some signs of life here over the past couple months. As the world's largest producer of that metal, I was hoping you could provide some color as to what you're seeing fundamentally that's driving the price strengthening? Richard C. Adkerson: I'm going to asked Dave Thornton to come down here and get by the phone. Dave is the guy that runs our moly business. David H. Thornton:  Yes, the fundamentals are basically is that the market has tightened up primarily in Europe as we've seen some improvement in the European economies, mainly Spain, Italy, big steel producing regions and countries. And then the supply has been tight, so mainly you're going \u2013 the traders in the market, the suppliers who are basically like us are meeting our contractual obligations. So mine supply is tight demand picked up a little bit but not a lot, but because of the tightness in the market we're seeing that the traders are involved more. And we're seeing some uptick, price has increased roughly $3 in a month. And that still occurring, although we are seeing that the trade is backing off a little bit and taking some profits looks like recently. So the price has come back off around $12.50 last ever. Garrett Nelson \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets : Yeah. Richard C. Adkerson:  Molybdenum is a relatively small global market. David H. Thornton: Right. Richard C. Adkerson: And so changes can have a dramatic effect over short periods of time. Most molybdenum goes as a metal into steel alloys. A significant part of our production, because of our high grade of molybdenum that we produce at our standalone molybdenum mines in Colorado, Henderson and Climax, goes into higher values from a margin standpoint chemical marketplace where it's used as catalysts in refineries and for other chemical \u2013 high-end chemical users. But, with Europe being a substantial steel producer and with some upticks in the steel marketplace, that's created a tightness in a relatively small global marketplace. Garrett Nelson \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets :  Okay, that\u2019s great detail. Thanks a lot. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Charles Bradford with Bradford Research. Please go ahead with your question. Charles Bradford \u2013 Bradford Research :  Hi, good morning. I've just gotten back from China, and they've continued to revise their back data. For right now it's 2013, the effect of which is to reduce the growth rates in March 2014. The same thing occurred of course all of last year. Do you have any evidence or have you seen anything whether the same is occurring in copper? Because frankly our copper concentrate data out of China has almost disappeared, and we're sort of at a loss as whether the same thing is occurring. Richard C. Adkerson: Copper concentrate data? Charles A. Bradford \u2013 Bradford Research, Inc.:  Yes. Richard C. Adkerson: Well you are seeing a situation where with the development of the smelter business in China there is more important concentrates in relation that there has been historically but listen Chuck, we commercially sell product into China we sell copper, cobalt occasionally some of it and we worked directly with customers. We\u2019re not traders and you know the numbers you talk about get obscured, because of this issue of how copper flows in and out of these bonded warehouses and so forth and I know it\u2019s a complicated situation we\u2019re not a great source of information for that sort of thing. All I can report on is how we are dealing with customers and normal course of business. And what was seeing is relatively strong demand both for copper and for cobalt. James R. Moffett:  Just we've been tracking in the past their own copper concentrate production tying it to imports, and then eventually into refined output, and the data just is a little bit more sparse than usual, but they seem to have been reporting much lower growth rates than otherwise would have been the case if they hadn't revised up last year. Richard C. Adkerson: Yea, well there is a CRU report that came out this morning, I read in the predawn hours and you can look at it and see their commentary on that very subjects. Charles A. Bradford \u2013 Bradford Research, Inc.: Well, thank you very much. Richard C. Adkerson: Thanks. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Brian T. MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities Canada, Inc.:  Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. For Indonesia, and I think it's come up before with the smelter, there's been different cost estimates and whatever, but I just want to be clear. This smelter if it gets built, will be big enough to take the remaining concentrate out of Grasberg going forward so we're not going to get stuck with say 20% of the con still getting hit with a graduated tax. It would seem to me that would be an awfully big smelter. Richard C. Adkerson: Well there are capacity limits for building a smelter. The biggest smelters in the world are flash furnace smelters that can produce 400,000 tons a year which say takes 1.6 million tons of concentrate. That plus we actually would not cover us in all years, but our production is variable. Particularly as we make this transition from open pit to total underground operations. So that is one of the complicated issues we're dealing with. I just want to point out something Brian; under the current regulations the export duty applies to all concentrate exports, not just what's net above smelter future to smelter requirements. So that\u2019s one of the issues that\u2019s still under discussions and subject to regulatory changes. Brian T. MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities Canada, Inc.: Okay. Richard C. Adkerson: There are other developers I might mention, Indonesian companies had indicated plans to develop smaller scale smelters in Indonesia, there is not a lot of details on those plans, we have signed conditional sales agreements to sell occasionally certain amount of concentrates to those Indonesian smelter developers. Brian T. MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities Canada, Inc.: Great, thanks. My second question then just relates as mentioned, you do pay a lot of taxes to the Indonesians. Can you just refresh my memory how you pay them, when they get their cash? And secondly, the fact that now you're only at 40%, and therefore, you're not paying tax on exported concentrate. Does that affect the overall tax structure at all going forward? Richard C. Adkerson: Our taxes are defined by the contract of work. We have a 35% tax rate, even though the tax rate generally in Indonesia today is 25% and then and that tax is based on incomes, there are some specific rules about how you calculate it, but its an accounting base taxable income determination, you apply that rates to it. Then in addition when dividends are paid from PT-FI to FCX there is an incremental 10% tax on those dividends. And so that\u2019s where you add that up, plus the royalties, plus the dividends on the government\u2019s 9.3% -- 9.36% equity interest is where you get the Indonesian government\u2019s participation in total income greater than 50%. And so what is affecting the current income tax, but income taxes are paid basically on a one year lag basis, right in other words your current year\u2019s taxes is essentially based on your earnings from the prior year. So what's happening to the government today is because we are incurring 100% of the cost selling half or less of our concentrates, the taxable income is shrinking and so the government tax take of that which is payable next year is being reduced. Accounting purposes as you know well, because you follow this I think more closely than anyone else, we accrue for the tax expense based on our current income recognition, not when the taxes are paid. Brian T. MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities Canada, Inc.:  Right. Okay, thanks. And just last question, and again like Oscar being a mining guy, just on Eagle Ford, it obviously had a very good first quarter. You provided different guidance a little bit for this year. But if I looked at it in simple terms, it looks like there's a pretty fast decline rate going forward to get to your averages for the year. Is that because you're harvesting that aggressively for cash, or is that something that was better-than-expected the first quarter, how should I think about that going forward? James C. Flores:  I think a little bit of both. I mean obviously, we reduced our rig counts from nine rigs 2.5 years ago to two rigs. And what that means, obviously, is less the completions in the future. We\u2019ve been managing that completion inventory, at the same point in time, the wells have performed better overall in the field. So therefore, it's slowing that decline rate, because they're staying at higher production rates early on in their lives. So as we go forward, the production rates are probably a little conservative going forward. And we probably be adjusting those later this year, as we get a little more time on those curves and feel like we can feel good about projecting giving you tighter projections. But right now, the field continues to outperform on all fronts. Brian T. MacArthur \u2013 UBS Securities Canada, Inc.: Great, thank you very much. James C. Flores: Thank you, Brian. And listen thanks everyone for joining us on our call. Jim Bob? James R. Moffett:  [Technical Difficulties] Richard C. Adkerson: Thanks good bye. Thanks Jim thanks Team, everybody\u2019s good work and thank all of you fro being part of our call and your interest in our company. Let David know if you have any follow-up question and we\u2019ll respond to them. Thank s. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we would like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. I\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials, and to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. On the call today are, Jim Bob Moffett, our Chairman of the Board; Richard Adkerson, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Flores, President and Chief Executive Officer of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas and we have got other senior members of our team here with us today. I will start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who will review our recent performance and outlook. Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $482 million or $0.46 per share for the second quarter of 2014. The next income attributable to common stock during the second quarter 2014, included charges totaling $130 million or $0.12 per share comprised of $58 million for environmental obligations and related litigation charges, $58 million for deferred taxes recorded in connection with the reduction of goodwill associated with the sale of the Eagle Ford during the quarter and $4 million for net non-cash mark-to-market losses on oil and gas derivative contract. The second quarter results, we reported strong operating performance in Americas and Africa mining operations and from our oil and gas business. The results also reflected the impacts of reduced productions and sales from Indonesia associated with export restrictions imposed in mid-January. Consolidated second quarter copper sales of 968 million pounds were above a year ago quarter reflecting growth in North America. The gold sales of 159,000 ounces were below the year ago quarter. Our copper and gold sales volume were below our April 2014 estimates, primarily as a result of the deferral of exports from Indonesia, which reduced copper and gold sales by approximately 150 million pounds of copper and 240,000 ounces of gold during the second quarter. As indicated in our press release, we expect to complete an agreement with the Indonesian government immediately which would enable export to resume immediately. The second quarter sales of oil and natural gas totaled 16 million barrels of oil equivalent that included the Eagle Ford reserve through the June 19th despite of the sales that exceeded our April estimates by 5% primarily as a result of higher production from Eagle Ford and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Our second quarter average realized copper price of $3.16 per pound, approximated the year ago quarterly average of $3.17. Gold prices of $1296 per ounces were slightly below the year ago quarter of 1,322 per ounce. Oil prices remained strong during the quarter, with Brent prices averaging $110 per barrel and the average realization by Freeport-McMoRan oil and gas was $100 per barrel before the hedging impact. Operating cash flows generated during the quarter totaled $1.4 billion, that was net of $400 million for working capital uses and changes in other tax payments during the quarter, and our capital expenditures totaled $2 billion during the quarter. As previously reported, we completed the sale of the Eagle Ford field during the second quarter for growth proceeds of $3.1 billion before purchase price adjustments and also completed the acquisition of additional assets in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for $900 million. Combine the transactions provided $1.8 billion of after-tax net proceeds before purchase price adjustment. We ended the quarter with total debt of $20.3 billion and consolidated cash of $1.5 billion. We also reported today that we redeemed $1.7 billion of face amount of our senior notes and that was called for redemption last month that transaction has been completed. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Richard who will be referring to the slide materials. Richard Adkerson : Good morning, everyone. As Kathleen talked about results for the second quarter reflects strong performance from our mining operations in the Americas and Africa, and from our oil and gas business. It does reflect the impact of the restricted sales from Indonesia, because of this export situation and I will be talking more about that. Our outlook at the first quarter earning release was based on assumption of resuming production in the May and the export restrictions lasted throughout the quarter. We did make good progress on our growth projects. At Morenci, we are commissioning of our new mill started in May and we are in ramp up process for that. The major construction project at Cerro Verde is progressing well towards the 2016 start-up. Jim, will be talking about the Lucius development, the operator Anadarko expects first oil in the second half of this year and the Highlander project, onshore in South Louisiana is advancing towards completion activity is also in the second half of this year. We completed the sale of the Eagle Ford asset and the acquisition of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico interest that enhanced our position for the focus area of our growth in oil and gas business for the future. We are actively in the process of pursuing additional asset sales transactions, all part of our goal of targeting a major debt reduction by 2016 -- by the end of 2016. As a matter of information, we have changed the name of our company to Freeport-McMoRan from Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold to reflect expanded scope of our business. Our ticker symbol remains FCX. The financial highlights that Kathleen reviewed are included on page four. The major difference from the data that we presented to you earlier has to do with the Indonesian restricted production situation. Otherwise, our operations performed in accordance with our previous guidance. The current status of where we are at PT Freeport Indonesia is that since January -- mid-January that regulations were adopted -- dated January 11th. We have not had authorization to export copper concentrate. In those regulations, the Indonesian government provided for a process to export concentrates, but they enacted a prohibitively large export duty, which is still in the regulations, but it is, we understands in the process export duty is -- in the process of being reduced. The impact of this is that we have had deferred sales of 150 million pounds of copper and 240,000 ounces of gold. I used the term deferred because the resources are still there available for our production and sale in the future. We also have a sizable level of inventory of copper concentrates at our site available for shipment. Year-to-date, these deferrals have accumulated 275 million pounds of copper and 380,000 ounces of gold. We have been working with the Government of Indonesia for roughly two and half years now to try to reach a common ground on dealing with our long-term contract situation. Our ability to continue our operations post 2021. That\u2019s a key date, because our current contract award signed in 1991 had a 30-year initial term and it provided for our having the rights to two 10-year extensions to 2041. Those extensions require approval by the Government of Indonesia. The contract provides, though, that the government cannot unreasonably withhold or delay these applications. On the basis of that contract we report reserves through 2041. The complications that we face is that in 2009 the Government passed a new mining law that transitioned Indonesia\u2019s dealings with miners from a contract of work system, which is what we have to a licensing system. The licensing system provides in general terms, that holders of licenses are subject to prevailing laws and regulations, and so you don\u2019t have assurance of fiscal terms that we and another contract of work holders. The law provides the contract of works will be honored to their terms. And our discussions have been dealing with finding away that acceptable for us in terms of protecting our shareholders interest and finding a way that the government officials in Indonesia can feel comfortable with in terms of their view, their responsibilities under the government\u2019s laws and regulations. Our initial objective in recent discussions with the government has been to find the way forward of getting exports approve and returning to normal operations. The financial consequences of not being able to export are significant. Where we are because we have an interest in a smelter that we arranged to be built in Indonesia in the mid 1990 is we have the ability to ship copper concentrate to this smelter owned by a company called PT Smelting, which we own 25% and our partner Mitsubishi owns the majority interest and operate. We can ship there and so as a result, we can ship about half the level of normal sales of concentrates that we have the capacity to produce and we have been flexing our operations to deal with that. We have not made major reductions to our cost structure today, because that has potentially long-term implications to our operations and potential for disruptions in the local community and with our workforce. As a result of that the reduced margins amounts that we\u2019ve earned from our operations there have amounted to an aggregate of $1.4 billion and next year roughly half and half by Freeport and Government of Indonesia. So we are working diligently to first find the way forward to resume export and normal operations, and doing that in a way that protects our position for the ongoing discussions about the arrangements for us to be able to continue operations beyond 2021 on acceptable basis. Over the past two months, we have month and a half, we have been working with the government on a Memorandum of Understanding. We believe that we have reached an agreement with the government officials we\u2019ve been working with on the terms of that MoU. It is yet to be signed. Indonesia had a Presidential election on July the 9th and the results of that vote were only announced on July the 22nd. The elections during the first half of the year for the President, for the parliament earlier have been a distracting issue in terms of our ability to reach this agreement with the government. But we believe we have reached agreement on the terms of MoU. Under that MoU, which, as I said, has not yet been signed but we expect to be signed shortly. We have -- we would agree to provide for payment of an export duty over the next three years 2014, \u201915 and \u201816. But that significantly reduce rates from the regulations that were adopted in January. In addition, we would provide $115 million assurance bond for the development of new smelter capacity in Indonesia and we\u2019ve indicated a willingness to meet the government\u2019s objective of developing this smelter capacity subject to further negotiations and those negotiations involve -- include having an agreement on acceptable terms for continuing our operations beyond 2021. We\u2019re talking with the government and providing financial incentives because building a new smelter in today\u2019s world is financially uneconomic. We are also looking at involving strategic partners in the process, and so there is work to be done on this smelter issue that require further work but we did -- we are making this deposit of insurance bond, which would be release as progress on the smelters is achieved. The new mining loan related regulations provided for increased royalties. We currently pay a royalty of 3.5% for copper. The mining laws regulations right raised that 4%, we pay 1% on gold and the new mining law is 3.75%. As an accommodation to the government to achieve this MoU allowing us to resume exports, we've agreed to -- upon signing of MoU to pay the new royalty rates. Now, all of these issues are things that we've done that represent prudent steps in building good relationships with the Government of Indonesia, which we have had over the 40 years of operations there and building the basis, a bridge for our continuing good relationships for the long-term. It's a situation that we've had a lot of experience with not only in Indonesia but around the world in terms of trying to find ways of protecting our interest of our shareholders, at the same time trying to meet the aspirations of the government officials and so that is the basis for this concessions that we\u2019ve agreed to making this MoU. We are -- have agreed with the government that upon signed MoU we will commence immediate negotiations for amendments of our CAL on items that we will be addressing, including importantly the ability to continue operating beyond 2021 on the basis of assurance of legal and fiscal terms to support the significant investments in developing our underground resources. Our current outlook numbers, if you see in our release are based on resumption of exports in August, any delays in obtaining these approvals result in monthly deferrals additional 50 million pounds of copper and 80,000 ounces of gold. If for whatever reason this falls apart, we don\u2019t expected to, we think we have a way forward with these things then we would take steps to adjust our cost structure and reduce our CapEx, because it is not sustainable to go forward on the basis that we've been operating on since January. Slide six, I won\u2019t just refer to in general, it talks about our long-term positive relationship in Indonesia. As you know this has been a fabulous asset for Freeport and for Indonesian, the workers and the local community. It\u2019s world class. It\u2019s been very profitable. We made investments of significance during very risky times in the copper markets and risky times in Indonesia and Papua and we have all benefited over the last 10 years as copper prices, gold prices are risen so much and we got a huge reserve base to go forward for many years in the future. We've been there for over 40 years, contributed over $60 billion to the country's G&P. We represented over 90% of the economy in the area that we operate in and a significant contributed to Indonesia's national GDP, 30,000 workers. We developed already the company's only copper smelter, which has capacity that exceeds Indonesia\u2019s national copper consumption, very significant investments today with $15 billion program to develop our underground resources. We contribute significantly to the local community, including the voluntary contribution of 1% of our revenues to the Freeport partnership fund. And so we\u2019ve done a lot of things and you can see the government benefits from taxes, royalties and dividends, notice, bulk of that is trough taxes, which we have a fixed rate on. And the government gets more than 50% of the financial benefit. So there is a lot of reasons, incentives for the government to work with us and we\u2019re going to work with the government to established, rebuild and maintain our long-term goodwill and partnership going forward. We\u2019ll be available to answer questions on this. Turning to copper markets, first half of 2014 has been in some ways a mix bag, going into the year, there were lot of questions about the China's economy and growth rates and how that we are going to maintain that. They had this unusual situation of apparently fraudulent activity at a port in China that spooked the market for awhile and some elements of China has been strong than people anticipated, but on balance, on balance China have had solid demand and has shaken off some of the earlier issues of the year and remains key to the marketplace. In the rest of the world, there has been a degree of general economic recovery. Again that has been spotty with the mix data we\u2019ve had here in the U.S. Europe, we seeing our business in Europe, gradual strengthening, of course, there are lot of geopolitical uncertainties going around the world today that could have economic consequences. But having looked at that to see the level of copper prices that we have today, I think demonstrates the long-term strength of the copper markets. Prices continue to be supported by supply side challenges which we\u2019ve talked about for so many years. Exchange inventories are extraordinarily low levels. There is limited scrap availability, consumer stocks are low and the industry continues to struggle to maintain production levels from aging mines and to advance expansion projects. There's a significant deferral of major projects around the world as companies look to cut capital, focus on return to shareholders, the supply side issue will continue to be a major supported back for the marketplace and we\u2019re very excited about the copper markets and where we stand in that market with our large and growing level of production and our very large resource base that will give us future growth opportunities. The projected market surpluses that people reporting to are now appeared to be much lower levels than anticipated. So, we are -- we remain very positive on long-term fundamental of the marketplace. Turning to our business, these slide, specifically the slide on page eight demonstrates that we have performed well, you can see in relation to our first quarter results, strong performance in North America, South America, Indonesia reflects the issues that I just spoke about and an Africa where we have had relatively good reliability of our power sources improves there, we really performed very well. So our businesses are doing well. You can see the results from a volume standpoint at bottom of the chart. With are projects we undertook three projects to expand our copper volumes by roughly a $1 billion pounds a year. Last year, we brought the Tenke project online and did that in a very effective way and that expanded operations performing well. We achieved another milestone in this quarter by executing the growth project with the start-up at Morenci and that is a significant high return project that will add 225 million pounds of copper per annum and Morenci is a resource that we are looking for future long-term significant growth. We benefit with these projects by bringing talent from our global operations to supplement the work done by contractors, every project has it challenges. You see that throughout the industry but when you working with it, it\u2019s easy look at these numbers and see how we do it, but it\u2019s a lot of difficult work in getting the job done. We are very optimistic about our footprint of our business in United States, about our ability to repeat what we've done at Morenci at other site, go get Morenci and other sites. Cerro Verde is huge project, when its completed this will be the largest concentrator milling operation in the world with 360,000 tons day. Our team is totally focused. It's a project that is have less risk than many other expansion projects because of the footprint what we have done in the past, we completed -- virtually completed engineering procurement. Now we are focused on managing this very large scale construction project. None of these are without challenges and Cerro Verde has its, but it's really going well and we see a clear line of site start-up late 2015. And despite all of the issues in constraining production at Grasberg, we continue to make good progress in our underground development and this is important terms of our being able to execute our mine plan of completing mining in the pit which will likely now extent until the first quarter or so early 2017. The Deep MLZ mine, the extension of our current producing field design, it was targeted start-up in second half of 2015 and this just represents a continuation of block caving that PT Freeport Indonesia started in the early 1980. So these projects are going well. What we are looking to is a portfolio of world scale mines that spend low with great growth opportunities, there -- just a handful of mines today that produce a billion pounds of copper per year. We have Grasberg in that category, Morenci will reach that, Cerro Verde will reach that, Tenke Fungurume has the resources availability to ultimately reach it and we are looking at expanding our El Abra mine with sulfide resources that we put in that category. So we go right about having this portfolio of asset with potentially five world-class operations. We are really pleased with Jim and his teams doing in oil and gas business and now he will give us some comment on it. Jim Flores : Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. The oil and gas business continues to click alone quite nicely that with strong crude market, I think everybody has paid attention to the political unrest around the world and it\u2019s helped (indiscernible) not the near-term but the long-term tail of the crude oil market and so, it helps our transaction business but also for standpoint our realizations continued to hold up very well mainly in the Gulf of Mexico. When we talk about sale of 60 million barrels, 5% above our investment and Kathleen said as, due to strong performance in the Gulf of Mexico and also our Eagle Ford with a $58 barrel margin and 50% of that comes from the Gulf of Mexico $73 BOE margins. The results today do include our Eagle Ford production because actually we sold at the right end of the second quarter. So third quarter going forward we will not have the Eagle Ford in it but we will have additional resources from the Gulf of Mexico and it continues to replace those reserves that we sold to $3.1 billon. Talking about that transaction on page 12, we sold to Encana it here, as we fully acquired. We rotate it. It\u2019s about $900 million of deepwater Gulf of Mexico interest. We consolidate more interest in the Lucius oil development, that\u2019s operated by Anadarko that we have significant interest and gives us just about quarter interest in that development. And this is on schedule for the second half of this year September, October start-up as far as we always bringing that nice oil reserve on production. Our Heidelberg oil development is a new entry for us. Anadarko also operate 12.5% interest in Heidelberg. It\u2019s another significant Miocene play just west of our Holstein. It\u2019s very integrated into our geologic thinking and development thinking. We think there\u2019s lot of oil reserves there and that development is scheduled to come on second half of 2016. And we got some complementary oil and gas places to some of the resources we were capturing. So all-in-all, it was a good -- it was a very good swing. By the end of 2017, we project these assets to be producing as much as the Eagle Ford assets were going to produce, once the client sets in there and after the drilling is finished in the Eagle Ford assets where we have engineer. So we feel like we\u2019re replacing with a lot more growth and a lot better margin in the Gulf of Mexico. As an important step in the debt reduction program, we want to accelerate the corporate goals of getting down to $12 billion by 2016. It\u2019s been definitely value accretive on EBITDA basis and help refocus our portfolio, the strategic growth there is on the Gulf of Mexico. These will be our big areas of growth, higher investment returns. Currently, we are on the eve of the beginning to start rolling with our mobile units out in the Gulf of Mexico. Next week, the Noble Sam Croft goes to work out at our Holstein facility. We\u2019ve got a rig on our Holstein platform that\u2019s drilling development wells and as of this morning, just drilled our second excellent-looking development well there, the first one cruising over 3,000 barrels a day. So as we sell these onshore assets and redeploy the capital on our balance sheet and some of the capital in the Gulf of Mexico, we will not only be replacing the production but growing production much faster in the years to come, now as the rigs were replaced. We had a Noble Sam Croft starts next week. We had Noble Tom Madden started here in. And then we have a new relationship out there in deepwater but an old relationship in the drilling contracting business with Rowan Drilling Company, with the Rowan Relentless that\u2019s going to start first half of \u201815. What you\u2019re going to see there is a tremendous amount of upside pressure to our production profile there in the Gulf. Our guys have done a great job at Holstein. For example, we bought the property that was producing about 11,000, 12,000 barrels a day. Today it\u2019s over 24,000 barrels a day after just drilling one well. It\u2019s a great production maintenance. So with this activity, it\u2019s been a long time coming since the acquisition of 2012. That\u2019s what the genesis of our combination, was able to accelerate the development activity going forward on these properties. At the same point in time, further investment in Gulf of Mexico. So we project that we\u2019ll have $4 billion to $5 billion more of onshore asset sales to further accelerate the debt paydown, debt reduction plan here at the company. At the same point in time, we will be buying additional interest in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico to complement our portfolio in the hundreds of millions of dollars. So we\u2019ll be selling in the $4 billion to $5 billion range and will be buying in the hundreds of millions of dollars to add to our potential launch forward. This has been a very successful program so far. We spent about $500 million on the last two oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and including significant onshore effort of buying leases. And we feel like we doubled the reserve potential or the resource potential of our business from 3 billion barrels to over 6 billion barrels that we capture and at the same point in time paying down significant amount of debt here at the company. So we\u2019re going to continue this process and going forward and the future looks like bright in all front, the assets sales as well as the Gulf of Mexico strategic position. On Page 13 is just kind of get you the breadth of our operations. Now we are fully integrated in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We have operating producing assets with the great staff, great systems, topline operations and doing a great job out here with all the guys and all the partnerships with all out vendors as well that really stepped up. So we can get our jobs done on time and on budget. We\u2019ve major development projects that we\u2019re doing, the tiebacks to our existing facilities as well as the major development. There are partners that doing like Anadarko that have done a great job at Lucius and also at Heidelberg and then with our exploration opportunities, here is the picture of the Sam Croft here. Now that we have top-flight equipment, we\u2019ll have three of this drilling by the end of -- by the middle of next year and we\u2019ll see some real action here on the development front on the wells and the production going forward. Those three rigs will be situated between Horn Mountain, Ram Powell, Holstein, Heidelberg and Lucius areas on Page 14. Right now, at Holstein we have the rig running on the platform as I said before. We\u2019ve got the Transocean and Deepwater Champion drilling our copper well right now, exploratory wells south of Holstein that if successful, will be tied back to Holstein and then we have the Sam Croft as I said is moving on today. To the west side of Holstein structure, we drill some of the discoveries we made few years back. Holstein is going to look like invaded but it\u2019s going to really see a lot of great production growth in \u201815 and \u201816 because of it. Moving on to our development projects at Lucius and Heidelberg. As I said these are both on time and you see the net interest now about a quarter of Lucius, 12.5% of Heidelberg and then fall of this year, Lucius comes on and then the fall of 2016, the Heidelberg project comes on, both significant development assets that Anadarko\u2019s done a great job with. On the emerging exploration plays in the new lower Tertiary/Cretaceous activity, we continue to monitor activity out there. We moved -- we\u2019re getting ready to move the rig in on a Farthest Gate West project to work on Lineham Creek, would be a (indiscernible) 25,000 feet that is excited about. And we\u2019re moving forward on the completion of the Highlander that\u2019s on schedule for either late September or early October. Well tests as well as Blackbeard East and Blackbeard West, we\u2019re moving forward to complete those wells as well. So there has been a lot of completion activity. We\u2019re going to have a lot of understanding of flow reservoirs, and hopefully some fantastic production coming, especially out of Highlander going forward. 2014 outlook, Richard, you want to take off from here. Richard Adkerson : Okay. Thanks Jim. We\u2019re updating our outlook. It reflects the -- from our previous outlook the delay in getting restarted at Grasberg. This is based on a resumption of exports, returning to normal operations in August and shows sales outlook for our company as a whole of 4.1 billion pounds of copper, 1.3 million ounces of gold, 98 million pounds of molybdenum. By the way the price of molybdenum is up over 30% this year and oil equivalents of 58.4 million barrels equivalents. That\u2019s lower than previous because of the Eagle Ford sale. And as Jim said, we\u2019ve got investment activities to look for future growth in that area. We are now projecting at -- for the year, unit cost of a $1.50 a pound, that\u2019s $1300 of gold and $12 of molybdenum and $20 of barrel equivalent for oil. Operating cash flow is at 325 copper for the second half would be at $6.8 billion and capital expenditures now are looking to come in at $7.6 billion. Our sales profile looking forward shows the significant growth for copper as we complete our expansion projects and see the effects of those expansions projects plus the year 2016 reflects in essence the final activities in the Grasberg open pit where we\u2019ll have very high grades of copper and you will note the planned gold sales for that year are exceptionally high. Note also at the bottom right, the growth in oil and gas sales as these expansion projects, Jim just talked about coming on stream. Quarterly outlook is presented on Page 19. Again based on restart at Grasberg in August and having a very strong second -- particularly the fourth quarter is for copper and for gold that\u2019s our detail that would result on that basis of an improvement in our unit cost from the experience in the second quarter where we would look to bring in the year combined with what we had in the first half of the year at 1.50 per pound for copper and you can see how that breaks down in our different regional areas. When we look at our models for cash flows on Page 21, you see EBITDA numbers at the top operating cash flows which take into account cash taxes and cash interests, excluding working capital changes and you can see this is an average for 2015 and 2016 and very strong cash flows between $3 and $4 ranging from over $10 billion to over $14 billion with that range. So we\u2019ve got a business that generates great margins from cash flows that allows us to fund our expansion projects. You can see our current outlook for capital as our mining projects wind down going into 2016 and then as our oil and gas investments reflect the opportunities that we\u2019ve created there. So this is a really no changes in the \u201816 outlook for that. We referred a couple of times to our commitment to our balance sheet management when we announced the oil and gas deal. We\u2019ve talked about targeting, reducing debt to $12 billion by the end of 2016. We\u2019ve had some challenges with copper prices have been weaker than they were prior to that announcement. We\u2019ve had the issue with deferred revenues from Grasberg but we still are committed to having this strong balance sheet. We sold a very good asset in the Eagle Ford asset in the second quarter. We are working now directly on additional asset sales across our business. We are prepared to respond to market conditions. We can\u2019t predict near-term market outlooks but we will respond to those whatever they may be. And we look further opportunities to repay, reduce our debt, improve our maturity structure and so forth. We are committed to continuing to pay our current dividend of a $1.25 a share for a year until we get our balance sheet in shape and once that happens with our business, outlook for commodity prices will have a chance of paying additional dividend. Beside asset sales, we have the opportunity of looking for participation by strategic partners in some part of our business to reduce capital expenditures. So we\u2019re looking at this at all angles, 2016 will be a very important year in terms of achieving this because of the nature of our business plans. So the story at Freeport stays the same. We\u2019re working on shareholder returns, managing our base assets, investing in growth as we reduce our debt. We had a good discussion last night about the challenges of doing that and there\u2019s not many business that can do it but we had the opportunity to do it. We are going to protect balance sheet because we and our board and we, I should, say are convinced that matching up kind of assets we have and the nature of the markets that we\u2019re in, strong balance sheet is a key to success in our business. And we want to continue our legacy of returning cash to our shareholders and look forward to the time when we reach that dividend levels, from where we are today. That completes our summary of our business. And now we will open the floor for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank : Good morning everybody. Yes, Jorge here from DB. Just wanted to follow up a little bit on the comments Richard, maybe, that were made at the start on the presentation 5 where you had mentioned that there was a possibility of selling other assets and then just picking up as well on Jim Flores\u2019 comments about potentially even shrinking your oil and gas footprint further from potentially selling things in the $5 billion range and then rebuying stuff in hundreds of millions of dollar range. So just kind of wanted to understand from a balance sheet perspective, how is Freeport feeling right now? Do you feel that on a go-forward basis, you\u2019re going to have to really do some asset sales to really make those to $12 billion net debt -- sorry debt target three years out. Just trying to understand really what\u2019s driving the divestiture landscape a little bit. There has been some rumours on Candelaria and now there is some talk of further oil and gas asset sales. So just trying to understand how you\u2019re feeling on your balance sheet right now? Richard Adkerson : Well, we are facing the fact that we\u2019ve had lower copper prices than we had going into the acquisition of oil and gas deal. We had the deferrals at Grasberg. I mean that\u2019s just part of the nature of our business. We have issues that we face and those create headwinds to reaching that. We don\u2019t know what copper prices are going to be in 2015 and 2016, and we are not going to bet our business on predicting prices. The way we\u2019ve been looking at assets to sell, and I think Eagle Ford is a great example of this. This was a very good asset. There was a very strong market of bars owning to invest in that as many companies are transitioning from a natural gas orientation to all orientation. We are looking at other assets where good assets but assets that don\u2019t have the growth profiles that our other assets have, and seeing if there is aggressive buyers who will step up and pay good prices for them, as we then focus on our assets that have good growth potential. As a future of our oil and gas business, the strategy there is built around the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and our gas exploration play, our deep gas exploration play. So we are continuing to do that. We are assessing the market, working with interested buyers. And if we can find transactions that in effect advance our ability to repay debt or derisk the ability to repay debt, as we don\u2019t know how things are going to unfold in 2015-2016. We will act to take place with that. These things require actions. We look at assets and test the market at times and decide those assets even as it makes sense to sell those assets when we look at their underlying cash flows. So this is a dynamic process. We are focused on debt reduction. And if we find assets that don\u2019t undermine our ability to grow in the future and where we have buyers that will pay reasonable prices in relation to cash flows they generate, we will execute those transactions. Jim Flores : Jorge, this is Jim. I would just echo what Rich talked about, the all of the above balance sheet management is the mantra across all sectors of the business. And with our large CapEx budget, we could manufacture more as we\u2019re going to do in the Gulf -- as we are doing in the Gulf of Mexico and so forth. And the fact of the matter of selling onto our oil assets, there is a premium market right now. The MLP market is very hot. Debt markets are very low. Oil prices are significantly strong. Even in the near term or long term, we can get representative value for those assets and then replicate those assets in an area in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater very quickly an area where we have higher margins the strength. It\u2019s a bad test to arbitrage that complements or accelerates our corporate objective of reducing the leverage companywide. At the same point in time, we are still hitting the same targets of about 200,000 to 225,000 BOE a day in 2017. And that\u2019s selling and then drilling our development wells to bring it forward. So by meeting those objectives operationally and bringing that cash flow forward out of those assets sales to accelerate the financial standing of the company, I think what is kind of highlight is all the resources we captured joining our platforms and lease sales and so forth. And everybody is going to get used to growing production in the Gulf of Mexico and monetization of production elsewhere in the company that will go towards the balance sheet repair. And I think that\u2019s what Richard talked about earlier. That\u2019s a two-edge sword. That\u2019s very difficult to do, grow business rapidly and pay down debt at the same time, but we are in a position to do it, take advantage of the price and so on. So it\u2019s just more of a -- it\u2019s a strategic initiative than a defensive. It\u2019s been just to be a more aggressive and trying to get our balance sheet very, very strong and be in good shape to take advantage if any opportunity comes after 2017. Richard Adkerson : And we have great set of assets that allow us to do that. Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank : And thanks. And Jim since you brought it up, the CapEx did increase for Freeport and it was mostly on the oil side about a $400 million increase for 2014. I was wondering if you could talk about, is that sort of accelerating growth in the Gulf of Mexico? Could you flesh out what that incremental growth CapEx is, especially just after a recent assets sale there? Jim Flores : Yes. Number one, we added some CapEx from the Heidelberg development which we acquired interest there that obviously went in our portfolio before. But the main driver that is that due to the stricter terms on some of the lease expansion and delays that the federal authorities put out here, we had to go ahead and move some rigs and try to get completions on our Blackbeard West and some of the Inboard Lower Tertiary/Cretaceous completion. So that was a more regulatory driven acceleration of that activity and we hope -- we surely hope it leads higher production rates and volumes. So it is to accelerate completion activity in ultra-deep. So in short term, either way. Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan: Yes. Good morning. The question on Indonesia. In terms of the new agreement that\u2019s a Memorandum of Understanding that you have agreement to but waiting to sign. It seems like the government is undoing a lot of the terms of the Contract of Work and replacing it with what you call this license agreements. Will they also -- will your tax rate now revert back to the statutory rate? Under the Contract of Work, you are paying a 35% tax rate, which was in place when you signed the agreement in the 90s. And now I believe that\u2019s the rate or the rate is 25% in Indonesia. Will your corporate tax rate drop as these other royalties go up? Jim Flores : Mike, let me -- I am going to go back over some things that I said earlier and just to make sure we got to stay set, with this MoU the basic terms of our Contract of Work are not being changed. And both our rights and obligations and the government\u2019s rights and obligations for the basic contract are not being changed now and we\u2019ve agreed to enter into a series of negotiations as to how to bridge this gap between our viewing the world with the eyes of our contract and the government viewing the world with the eyes of their mining law and related regulations, and that\u2019s the work to be done. The only three things that are currently actions that will be taken as a result of this MoU are the agreement to pay royalties, the agreement to pay these duties for a limited period of time, and the agreement to make this escrow deposit. So the tax rate will remain the same. The government\u2019s expectation is that the tax rate would remain the same going forward. And in fact under their licensing regulations for the formal license that would apply to us if we were under licenses to situation, there is a current 35% tax rate. So these things that we are doing now are in reality Mike concessions that we are making and our business judgment is that those concessions are warranted in terms of resolving the current impasse we have on the export bans. So it is a compromise to create a bridge for us so that we can return to normal operations, so that we maintain goodwill with the government to help us reach a resolution that it protects our shareholders interest in the long run and that\u2019s our reasoning for doing it. But all the other terms for the contract are not being changed with this MoU. Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan: Okay. And another question just taking a few steps forward from here, in regards to the construction of a new smelter in Indonesia. Is it your expectation that Rio Tinto would be responsible for funding 40% or some percent of the CapEx to build the smelters since they will be achieving the -- receiving the benefit of it in the future? Jim Flores : The structure of the ownership interest and how we deal with the smelters is yet to be finalized. Rio Tinto does have an interest in the operation as you mentioned in the long run, so they will certainly be at the table on this. We will also -- we\u2019ve had interest expressed by strategic partners about participating both in Indonesia and outside of Indonesia, and then the government we have noted in this MoU the discussion about financial incentives that the government would be able to talk about. So that is a work-in-progress like much of this MoU. The first step is the agreement to get us to work. Then we got a lot of work to do in terms of the long-term situation, including the smelter. And the reality Mike is the Commission that managed the elections just announced the results of the vote. There is going to be a transition of a new government that will come into place at the end of October. And so as we go forward, we are going to have a period of time of dealing with the existing administration and then dealing with a new government that has a five-year term. So that\u2019s another factor that will come into play, as we begin these negotiations on how to go forward. Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan: Okay. The last question on this and it\u2019s going to be a tough one to answer. But you have a contract with the government that suppose to supersede any changes in law in the country and the government comes in with the new mining law and basically changes part of the game. What\u2019s to stop the government from doing that again in a couple of years? Jim Flores : Well, we are going to have an arrangement. We\u2019ve been dealing with -- you asked a tough question, we\u2019ve been dealing with real tough questions here for 2.5 years. And so this is not an easy answer, but if you read what we\u2019ve said in our release carefully, and in the MoU we\u2019ve carefully crafted an acknowledgment and understanding that however we come out of this, we are going to have to have a basis for assured operations on fiscal and legal terms that protect our shareholder interest. So we will have those legal protections and then the business judgment will come out as to how do you deal with that going forward. And experience has taught us that the best way to do that if it\u2019s achievable is to find a way to deal with it in a way that reaches common acceptability. Indonesia needs foreign investment. Their economy has performed very well over the last 10 years. They have a very large internal economy that\u2019s growing. They become a member of the G20. The country has changed so much over the past 25 years I have been going there. And yet, they have a very large young population. And to put people to work, they don\u2019t have an internal saving rate as large enough to create investments, to create jobs that whoever presence is going to be have to have. So at the end of the day, they are going to need foreign investments. It\u2019s an emerging country and emerging democracy. They don\u2019t do everything as in the way that more developed country, more mature countries do, but there is going to be some imperatives for them to put people to work. It is a true democracy and so whoever is President, whoever is running the government is going to be responsible to these people because of the way that they can vote. And so it\u2019s not an easy path, and we have to make business judgments. But again we come back to the fact that those business judgments reflect our desire to have goodwill and partnership going forward and not just dig our heels in and point to out legal rights. So we\u2019ve done this and you saw we went through in the Congo. We had a situation there where we had to make some concessions but as a result of that we kept our asset, its operating very well. I believe, five years from now we look back and say we did the right thing and that\u2019s how we had to look at it from the long term because this is a very long-term asset, very valuable asset for our shareholders. You just look at those numbers in 2016 and it comes real apparent to you. We want to be operating there and take benefit of all this work we\u2019ve done. Since -- actually, since 1988, when we discovered the Grasberg and all during the 90s to develop our mine plans. We\u2019ve been looking forward to that year for a long time and we made a lot of money in the interim through difficult times in Indonesia, through operational issues, through political, social changes there, through tough copper markets. You and I know that all too well, Mike. So anyway that\u2019s we\u2019re working on this in a way that we\u2019re long term shareholders and going to protect their interest. Jim Bob Moffett :  This is Jim Bob. There\u2019s restructuring going on in the industry. People that have the concentrate want to have the smelters on there soil. So all this concentrate has been banned for export, mean that the smelters around the world are going to have reality. They are going to have develop smelters in the country where their concentrate is. That\u2019s what this whole export controversy\u2019s about. It\u2019s going to another country and that\u2019s why the strategic partners build this smelter, going to be coming because you can't take in and cut off as much concentrate, it has to stay on soil that is produced. So if you take that into consideration and realize it as we are in these negotiations which is the government. Not only there are other changes in the social structure of Indonesia, but there is a definite change of policy around the world. So the traditional market has concentrate been smelted in other countries. It\u2019s going to change quickly. So, we\u2019re in the middle of that. We\u2019re in the middle of the social development in Indonesia. But understand that we built this bridge with this MoU. To get in and take on the step that like what the tax rates are going to be and what kind of long-term agreement we have to have with the lease reserve in front of us. And we\u2019re converting this mine to an underground mine and the governments are well aware that we found the resource. We know where the traditional ore bodies are and so we have a long-term credibility with this government. And we will come up with something, especially with this restructuring of the whole market, when you talk about the refinery smelter requirements. But you\u2019re going to see that around the world. There\u2019s going to be a lot of statements in that when they control asset, but if you look at the world and see people who have tried get too aggressive with their control of asset, look at what\u2019s going on in Venezuela today. Headlines that you\u2019re seeing, we\u2019ve got headlines yesterday, chaos in Venezuela as a result of the political decisions that were made. So we have work through this. We\u2019ve been talking to this people a long time. And we have this partnership that was iced by our discovery of the Grasberg 88. And the government needs as to continue to have run that over. The government need us to build technical facilities. We\u2019re going to be building the largest underground mine in the world. So we have the latest global basis, when you\u2019re over there negotiated. So the contract is a big plus for us and that\u2019s why we can negotiate differently and think that they don\u2019t have it. Michael Gambardella - JPMorgan: Thank you for those comments, Jim Bob. Operator :  Your next question will come from the line of Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs : Good morning. Richard Adkerson : Morning Sal. Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs : Can you tell us again, what's the relationship between the expansion of COW torque and the MOU? Are they dependent on each other, or are they exclusively independent of each other? Richard Adkerson : Well, they\u2019re not interdependent on each other that MOU is a bridge to further negotiations on the contract of work and the rights to operate beyond, including the rights to operate beyond 2021. The MoU has two components to it. One is a current agreement to take three actions that are described earlier. And then it sets up for further process for the renegotiation, extended negotiation, foreign extension and so forth. So, it does not. It\u2019s a first step and it was first step resolve this export situation and then lead into the further negotiations. Sal Tharani - Goldman Sachs : So would you be willing to -- so your terms would be that MOU, sorry, COW extension should stay, as is, where which is sort of post-MOU agreement, which is higher royalty and so forth, that it extends that those conditions just remain the same for the next 20 years for the extension? Is that where you would stand? Richard Adkerson : Well, I think is a practical matter. With this agreement, we are agreeing to these new royalty rates for the life of mine. And you saw that chart that we had on page where we show the benefits to the government of Indonesia. Page 6, you can see that royalties are relatively small part of what we pay to the government. And yet it\u2019s a lightning rod issue, meaning, publicly in Indonesia, many people think of Grasberg as a gold mine. We pay a 1% royalty on gold. It is an amount of money. But is not major in relation to our total financial situation. So, this represents for the royalty I think, what our royalty rates going to be for the life of mine. When you get to this export duty, that\u2019s a short-term situation leading to the smelter development and that remains to be negotiated. So that\u2019s the duties, the deposits, that\u2019s all part of the smelter picture. That\u2019s got to be a hot bucket target. The purpose of this mining law in large part had to do with the nickel industry and the bauxite industry, where Indonesia is a major global supplier. And what Indonesia was doing, was mining raw ores, shipping them to Japan and China for further processing and for aluminum and nickel, the major part of the value is created downstream. And they have prohibited those and put a lot of small businesses and other size businesses in Indonesia, out of business. And politically, people view copper, even though it's economically different to be in the similar situated. So that's the problem we\u2019ve been dealing with. In a country, Indonesia is not alone like this, where you have resource nationalism to think about penalizing Indonesian companies and giving different situation for foreign investors like Freeport, is politically tough deal to swallow and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been dealing with. Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs : And last thing for me is, Rio Tinto obviously has -- is going to be a major part of this Indonesian mine, starting 2021. I'm just wondering, are they involved in these negotiations and will they be part of it, and would they have a say in it or is it, you are dictating the terms? Richard Adkerson : We\u2019re certainly not dictating the terms. We have a participation agreement with Rio Tinto. We\u2019ve had a great partnership. It\u2019s started in 1995. They have rights under their participation agreement. We have been negotiating with the government directly having discussions with them. There are many issues that we\u2019re going to have to work with together as we go forward. But we have a joint venture, it has participation agreement. They have rights under that and we will work with them consistent with their rights. But you're right, they are going to be a significant participant in the operations going forward. Jim Bob Moffett : Hi. This is Jim Bob again. In 1988 we had the blessing find the largest ore body in the world. You look at the copper, gold, silver, paying on copper prices and gold prices. So to find the 100-year live mine in the middle of New Guinea, up at 13,000 feet, which is quite a challenge. In fact that you have evolving world and all the market forces it work from the day we found the mine, trying to get out there and get that copper down from 13,000 feet. The remote area that has no infrastructure and no current employment base. We look at everything, aspects of this from the day we found the property. But the blessing is that it was the key measure and gave us an opportunity to build our business to what it is today. So the challenge of how you deal with the current year of mine in an ever changing world, we have to keep that in perspective. But the good news is we have richest ore body in the world and that rich ore gives us gold and silver byproduct, especially with what happened to the price of gold and price of copper since we found the mine. Price of copper was $100 for all those years as we found the mine. So talk about negotiations in looking forward and operations till 2041. We have to look back and say, we are blessed with the fact that we\u2019ve got something as probably when we producing till 2061. So that\u2019s what you have to do keep the mine on a pricing side having that kind of asset and we\u2019ve manage through to this just like we manage through all the other challenges. Sohail Tharani - Goldman Sachs : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Tony Rizzuto - Cowen & Company: Hi. Good morning, everyone. As I was listening to your comments, Richard and Jim Bob, about the sensitivities there. It seems like there's some similarities with what you all are dealing with in Indonesia, with what Rio's dealing in Mongolia and seems like the government kind of has an edge because the projects are further along, a lot of the value is underground? And I'm wondering, how should we -- should we be unnerved by statements coming out of the press in Indonesia that the CAL extension discussions would not begin until 2019? And is that just, that's not true? And first of all, can you make me feel more comfortable about that, as you're going through this process and clearly you're making concessions here? Is that what's the guarantee that you will be able to take that next step here, number one? Richard Adkerson : All right. Let me, first of all, just make a comment about this two-year situation. That is the result of a regulation that was adopted by the government. It\u2019s not a provision in the 2009 mining law. But the government considered -- the government that we have been dealing with considers that regulation to be important. And so that\u2019s been one of the barriers that we have had to get a completion of discussion on the contract extension. We have spent a lot of time advising the government that we cannot wait until 2019 to understand our rights to operate beyond 2021. And the terms of those operations between now and 2019, our plans call for us to spend $8 billion of capital in developing the underground mine and then we have this smelter situation to deal with. So there is important provision of this MoU is that we are going to -- we both agreed to deal with this issue over the next six months. So from the government standpoint, they have been looking at this regulation, our standpoint says our CAL makes us not applicable to that and the MoU says, okay, we are going to work this out. We didn\u2019t reach on it now. We are going to work this out over the next six months. Tony Rizzuto - Cowen & Company: Okay. Jim Bob Moffett : MoU, Tony, is a bridge. What that does is, it opposed to waiting until 2019, that was the mechanism, that\u2019s why we made the concessions so that we force both ourselves and the government to come to the table and realize. The good news is, we\u2019ve gotten that forward to be producing way in beyond 2040, we won\u2019t. But having this smelter issue come up, this mining law versus the CAL and the license. That\u2019s exactly what we try to do. To get this MoU move this negotiation period from 2019 to today. So everybody can understand the reality. We can be spend all those money underground. Our money on the smelter without having some financial assurance, doesn\u2019t do any good to build the smelter, if you don\u2019t build this underground mine, it actually not available to the smelter. So this is a very complex situation. But as I said earlier, this mine is so rich and so big, again raise this kind of problems that we have in the negotiation. That\u2019s what the MoU does and it starts the negotiation there to solve this problem in 2021. Tony Rizzuto - Cowen & Company: Thank you. And I guess that, I guess, my next question would be, I know you guys have been over there a lot and I just assuming a lot of your efforts these days? But have you been in direct conversation with the new President Jokowi or members of his team, the team elect there at this point and what can you tell us about his certainly understanding of the seriousness of this matters and his willingness now to meet you guys and his team at the table here as we go forward? Richard Adkerson : Well, Tony, we stayed out of the political process leading up to the election, it was a very hotly contested election. The elections tend to be and it\u2019s split parties, it split people and government, and we always in the position of not trying to influence election or get involve with them. We work with whatever government, people of the country elect and so we stayed out of the political process. The Vice President under Jokowi was former Vice President under first term of SPY and we have known him for a long time. He is business man. We had past relationships with people involved on both side of the election. Jokowi has made some positive comments recently about working to resolve the mining issue and we are going to be prepare to work with them as their transition goes from the current administration to his administration. Our hopes are that we will be able to engage with his transition team, his leadership team and working with the current government to help us began this process before they have come into office at the end of October. Tony Rizzuto - Cowen & Company: Okay. Thanks for that Richard and Jim Bob. And I guess the final question I have is, I haven\u2019t heard any mention today of possibly to a sell-down provision and I -- is that, I know in the past you have talked about you would be open to possibly divesting a stake that was previously owned by some Indonesian interest, but has that come up, is that something that is likely to be part of a future contract or business license arrangement and what can you say about that? Richard Adkerson : Yeah. It is one of the items, there were six strategic items that we have agreed to discuss in terms of the renegotiation our contract of work. This divestment issue is one of those and we have tentatively agreed on the process of divestment that would involve increasing Indonesian ownership interest overtime to 30% from the current 9.36%. That would involve giving initially the government an opportunity to acquire interest we have talked about having a listing on the Indonesian Exchange, which we view positively and the government views positively. Any divestment would be at fair value and but that is not something that is committed to under this or are the final agreement hasn\u2019t been reached under this Memorandum of Understanding. But that would be part of the amended CAL and but the current contemplation is that there would be divestment of fair value overtime to raise Indonesian ownership interest to 30%. Tony Rizzuto - Cowen & Company: Thank you, Richard. Thank you, Jim Bob. Jim Bob, I am sorry, you were going to say something too? Jim Bob Moffett : What I am saying is in the making out here is government understands the huge expenditure, first of all, underground and it actually talking in the government about a regulation that will come out and says that people will have underground, big underground mines. We have been shared the 30%. So there is a lot of people, thinking about lot of different things, mine open pit versus underground, major expenditures for getting underground and getting those. So again there is a bridge with this MoU. We always have this under table and try to get them understood. Tony Rizzuto - Cowen & Company: Thank you so much gentlemen. If I may sneak in one final question, I am sorry about this, I just want to ask Jim a question, and I noticed, I didn\u2019t hear anybody talk about this, but and I am sorry, if you -- if this is redundant? But the Davy Jones well test 2, I see that it was not a success? Can you make any further comments on that, just update us there? Jim Flores : Well, it wasn\u2019t the commercial success. We have work. We have perforated log section of resistant log section plus also section of the log that was suspect. We produced lot of salt water and some gas out of it. The only comment really that makes any sense, these are wildcat completion. We are learning from each on, the equipment worked flawlessly and so forth. We are merely took all the equipment we could and especially the tubing string and all the long we got out of Davy Jones No. 2 and moved expeditiously over to Highlander. And Highlander test is really going to be one of the definitive commercial moments in this whole play. So from the technical standpoint and engineering standpoint, we learned a lot, it was, I would say, everything was successful, safe and so forth. But from the commercial standpoint it was a failure. We are in the process of P&A in the No. 1 well, but we are unable to get the flow, I am going to take that equipment on No. 1 well and perforate the lower to tertiary Wolfcamp zone No. 2 well before year-end. That -- those operations plus the operations of Blackbeard West and Blackbeard East, we are -- as I said, were regulatory commitment from the standpoint and we are going to learn out of these things hope to establish the production there but all eyes on Highlander at this point, Tony. Tony Rizzuto - Cowen & Company: And what\u2019s the timing of that, Jim, Highlander, what should we be looking forward over there? Jim Flores : Highlander, my engineers are saying September, so I am telling you October, how is that. Tony Rizzuto - Cowen & Company: Okay. All right. Fair enough. Thank you, gentlemen. Thanks everybody. Jim Flores : Thanks. Tony Rizzuto - Cowen & Company: Kathleen too thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Ralph Profiti with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Ralph Profiti - Credit Suisse : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Most of them have been asked. If I can ask just one more relating to PT-FI in the state of the operation for when it\u2019s ready to go back to 100% because for the better part of eight months, Richard, the workforce has been largely kept in place. I was wondering would it be safe to say that you have say eight months of advance stripping and equipment maintenance in place. And to what degree could we see this as a positive impact in 2015 when you think about things like production strip ratio and mining costs, if everything goes to plan? Richard Adkerson : You made a good point Ralph. We have been -- kept our workforce productive during this time and we have been able to mine some waste and low-grade materials that we would have had to mine in the future. We\u2019ve done a lot of maintenance work. We\u2019ve kept the DOZ mine operating in a way so that we\u2019ve kept the caving operation going in the effective way. And so we\u2019ve really had a period of time despite this lower sales of having safe productive operations from our workforce and that will benefit us going forward. As I said we also have a substantial amount of concentrated inventory, that we don\u2019t have to work into the market place. Concentrated market is pretty well supplied already. It will take some time to do that. But we will be able to have very positive operations beginning immediately upon our authorization to export. Ralph Profiti - Credit Suisse : And by this renewed guidance, would it be safe to say that timing to get back to that would be a matter of weeks? Kathleen Quirk : Yes, Ralph, this is Kathleen. We\u2019re projecting in the guidance that you\u2019ve seen that we will start up operations in August. There will be a period of ramp up for the mill and a period of time to get ship scheduled to come in. But as Richard said we should get up to the capacity pretty quickly. Richard Adkerson : As an example of that Ralph, our second quarter unit operating costs for PT Freeport Indonesia was $2.66 per pound, $1.53 in the first quarter. And if we return to normal operations, for the year, it will be down to $0.96 per pound. So that just shows you how we can recover from this. Ralph Profiti - Credit Suisse : That\u2019s great. Thank you very much. Richard Adkerson : Thanks. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Just want to get back to, after you purchased the oil and gas assets from DXP and McMoRan. There was this notion of sales sustaining assets, meaning cash flow was from -- the oil and gas operations will be basically sustaining the development CapEx for oil and gas operations. We didn\u2019t tend to sell assets in oil and gas. Should we think about differently about that i.e. mining operations providing the free cash flow to -- for the development of oil and gas? Jim Flores : I\u2019ll take this question because when you sell the Eagle Ford cash flow that was about $600 million a year of free cash flow of business declining. But it was there and you said that some additional asset size we\u2019re talking about basically we\u2019re going to observe the short, the CapEx, the efficiency of variance between the cash flow and the CapEx level through the asset sales. So we really -- we're going to -- the amount of asset sales that we\u2019re going to sell or bridge negative cash flow in \u201814 and \u201815 on into a flat to positive year at \u201816 and then \u201816 oil will be self sustaining. So within the oil and gas, including the asset sales, we\u2019ll observe any negative cash flow. Richard Adkerson : We\u2019re consistent with that approach Oscar. Nothing has changed, it\u2019s just the CapEx where we\u2019ve funded from cash flow and asset sales of oil and gas assets. Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America : On that too -- but with the additional sales as you mentioned between $4 billion and $5 billion, I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s probably on the -- if its onshore California and that\u2019s where the vast majority of the free cash flow is coming. Would that still be the case? Richard Adkerson : Yes. Jim Flores : That will be the case. Remember this, those type of assets have zero tax basis. So the IDCs during the spending of \u201814 and \u201815 really helps for the tax basis offset and any kind of property acquisitions, smaller property as in iconic changes. There is a tax on product there that it benefits to have the negative cash flow on that year to offset the tax burden just by selling those properties. Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then if I may on Indonesia, this statement in the press release that talks about the MoU and Freeport paying over reduced export duties, that would decline the smelter development progress. Can you give us an idea of what level of reduced export duties you are looking at because 2016 your mine plant for Grasberg, we still have significant increases in both copper production and gold production that would be impacted by an export tax. Richard Adkerson : Yes, the process for completing the MoU will include the Ministry of Finance adopting new reduced export duties that will be declining rather than the current regulations which provides for escalating export duties. Currently, the export duty starts at 25% going to 60%. We expect and you know, it hasn\u2019t been adopted yet but we\u2019d expect the export duties to be initially below 10% and then they would decline based on progress with the smelter. Progress with the smelter would involve getting agreement on the long-term lives to operate. Our goal would be to work to get to zero export duty by 2016. Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America : Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then if I may, I\u2019ll be quick with this one. Can you just remind me of your agreement with Rio Tinto with the divestment of 30% in Grasberg? How would that impact the 40% in case in production from the asset? Richard Adkerson : Well we\u2019re talking about the divestment of shares in PT-FI. And that\u2019s what -- that's all we\u2019re talking about here. PT-FI would continue to own 60% in the joint venture with Rio Tinto. Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America : And in terms of production does that affect the share production, Richard? Richard Adkerson : No, it\u2019s PT-FIs what we\u2019re talking about. Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America : Thank you very much. Richard Adkerson : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Joan Lappin with Gramercy Capital. Joan Lappin - Gramercy Capital : Good morning everybody. Jim, would you talk about, I assume, it\u2019s your domain about the Gulf Coast Royalty Trust because even that was an important part of the complete transaction a year ago. And when -- what of the properties that remain viable, are going to come online and when that will influence that and also I would appreciate it, I guess, it\u2019s a variation on the previous questioner. On Slide 27, where you show your -- well 26 and 27 sort of fit together and you\u2019re showing your important areas going forward. I assume the big green, the biggest green dot shows the most oil in these new -- in the new areas that you have just expanded your position in and whatever and then my last part related to that as you\u2019ve shown us these different rigs that you will be using. Can you tell us how the cost of those relate to the drillship or whatever compared to the very expensive rigs that we were using in the shallow water ultra-deep gas project? Jim Flores : Okay, Joan, good morning. The Gulf Coast Royalty Trust, I\u2019m going to point you toward Kathleen Quirk and also you promised me a trip to Houston to go over all this in person and you haven\u2019t shown us yet. So I\u2019ll take this as our meeting there. And the aspect of the Royalty Trust is not really driving the aspects at Freeport. I mean, Freeport was being commercial. Decisions based on good engineering data in July, that\u2019s in the plan. The inboard lower tertiary that has grown beyond the Gulf Coast Royalty Trust footprint. But the most significant potential production asset we have today the Highlander project is in the Gulf Coast Royalty Trust. I would focus a 100% on that and if we come up with some significant production in Blackbeard West, Blackbeard East or Davy Jones 2 in the meantime then that\u2019s a bonus. What was depicted on Page 26 is -- and 27 is our producing assets, our major operating producing assets. And I emphasize producing because we have not produced any gas or oil out of the lower Tertiary/Cretaceous play. It\u2019s a frontier exploration play. On top of that, to your rig question and so forth, the different operations onshore versus deepwater, they don\u2019t really relate as -- the jack-up market is pretty much right now but we continue to work with our partner willing to provide the premium equipment and it\u2019s worked out -- worked out fine. These are lot of integral operations. You got to have the top wide equipments. So as far as the rig costs are about flat where they were. Jim Bob Moffett : Jim, as far as the royalty trust, rig was discovery in the (indiscernible) area and that prospects that were reflected by (indiscernible) and because of the mainland prospect which is a parallel structures just in the East. So I guess those have tremendous potential in the (indiscernible). So those various bottom shales represent several structures, 25,000 maybe and you have Highlander which was -- we are focusing on that which led to the cretaceous discovery and you have the (indiscernible) area mostly in addition to the (indiscernible). Jim Flores : Thank you, Bob. And Chevron operates Lineham Creek, that\u2019s why I have omitted it, because I was focused on our operations and the Lineham Creek completion is scheduled for midyear \u201915. And once again Joan I issue that invitation for you to come down to Houston and get up to speed on all the specifics. Thanks. Joan Lappin - Gramercy Capital : I accept. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead. John Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research : Good morning and thank you for taking my question and for the presentation. I am a shareholder, and I am very happy, and I am impressed at the good moves that the company has made to pick up the Apache assets, the 20 new leases in the Gulf of Mexico, the reservoir joint venture in Europe, the (indiscernible) joint venture just announced, and other new opportunities that you may consider. I am concerned that some other people might be worried the company is obstructed by debt or distracted by Indonesia. And I'm very pleased at the progress you're making in new endeavors, in spite of all of the distractions. Please explain in a little more detail how you're slowing down the less productive activities, and reallocating -- things change dynamically, you get a good drilling result at one property, you have a roadblock at another. Tell us a little more how you are being disciplined with the weaker projects to make more room for more of the good new opportunities, please? Jim Flores : Well, John, we have a great team. Rich here and just last week, we met with 50 or so of his managers in the Americas and reviewed every one of our projects there. Those guys are interested in what\u2019s going on in Indonesia, but they are not involved. They are playing different positions, and everyone is focused. We had our African team there too. Everyone\u2019s focused on their own business, and we sit down. We went through every one of our minds as to the operations they had done so far this year. What we are looking forward going forward? What were our growth opportunities? We have a separate group, that\u2019s working on going through our mining reserves and resources in assessing how we focused on the next stage of operations. That was a same process that we went through that came up with the Tenke expansion, the Morenci expansion and the Cerro Verde expansion. Jim and his team are very interested in what\u2019s going on in Indonesia, but they are really focused on running their assets well and looking for growth opportunities and divestiture opportunities, divestment opportunities and so forth. Jim Bob works closely with [Rick Lodale] (ph) our exploration, both our Brownfield and Greenfield exploration. So ultimately we step back from that and say where is our business judgment for the greatest opportunity to put the development resources on? And they bring in our development team to focus on that. Dave Thornton and his team has been running our molybdenum business very well. Of course we did the expansion at Climax. We monitored that market, managed production to meet the demands of the marketplace. So while as investors of course you\u2019re going to focus on the things that are currently most important from a corporate standpoint. Underneath that we\u2019ve got out great team, that\u2019s working on the rest of the business. And what I like about our company as opposed to when I look at the way larger companies they are running mining business and then the oil and gas business is, because we\u2019ve got such a great team, it frees. When we do have a problem like we have in Indonesia or Africa, we can put senior management to work and working with our guys on that team and the rest of our business does just fine. So we\u2019ve come a long way, you\u2019ve been watching us for a long time and where we started to, where we have ended up now, and I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the people we have and where our team works together to prioritize and deal with the broad scope of our business. Jim Bob Moffett : John, this is Jim Bob. Just a quick comparison. If we go back 10 years, this export problem related to the Grasberg mine, how would you like to have been dealing with the issues that we\u2019ve dealt with in the last five year? The strike and the accident and the export ban, if we have been three, four like copper and gold with single is the best asset in the world. So when you look at the press release today that we\u2019ve got all these in our Greenfield prospect for instance in the Congo. I just reviewed that recently (indiscernible) kilometers of ore at the surface that we are going to tie them together and using projections and drilling some deeper. We have a chance to have again another world class ore body. When you think about the (indiscernible) used our deeper sulfide ore exploration drilling that reserves, we found the equivalent amount of copper and gold equals another Grasberg just by drilling the Brownfield projects. So we are blessed with not only some of the biggest world class mines in the world, but we are blessed with the prospects that are becoming world class mines because of our brownfield exploration effort. Jim Flores : Thanks, John. John Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Paretosh Misra with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley : Thanks. Hi, everyone. So I have a follow-up question on your potential sale of stake at Grasberg. In case of a direct sale to the government, is it possible that you may have to provide financing for the sale of that stake? Jim Flores : Not for a direct sale to the government. What I am talking there is the central government and that\u2019s the way their regulations work. We have in the past -- we\u2019ve actually undertaken efforts to have a stake in the shares of PTFI owned by the province of Papua. We believe that could potentially be positive and we would consider providing some financing for that piece of the transaction. We tried to accomplish this several years ago and just wasn\u2019t able to get there. We would be really focused on making sure that any sale like that would be for the benefit of the province and the people of the province and not some third party investor, but that would be something that we would be considering as we go forward. Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley : Got it. So I guess if there's financing, it would be only for that chunk, 8% or 9%. And currently you're looking at only either IPO or sale to the central government? Jim Flores : Well, the 8% or 9%, the percentage that we would be talking about is not defined yet. 8% or 9% is a very large amount of money for an asset of this size, so that\u2019s uncertain as to where the -- any percentage that would come about and the process would be the central government under the way Indonesia works would have the first call. They had a call -- they had an opportunity to buy this interest that we reacquired from an Indonesia organization in the 2001 timeframe, and the government opted not to do it. Then we have the potential to do with some of the province, then beyond that, and the listing the IPO in the Jakarta exchange. And beyond that then there would be an opportunity for potentially other Indonesian nationals to invest. So it\u2019s a process that\u2019s yet to be worked out, it could be a combination of all of these. The important thing is that our shareholders would get fair value out of it and it would take time to execute all of these. Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley : Great. Thanks, Richard. Operator : Next question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS. Please go ahead. Brian MacArthur - UBS: Hi. Good morning. I have two questions. Just to be clear on the MOU, the day you sign it, imminently, whatever that means, the 115 goes into effect, the higher royalties go into effect, but then do the -- whatever the reduced export taxes on the concentrates go into effect, so if they were to be 10% going down to a lower number by 2016, that you will actually have certainty the day you start exporting on what those taxes are going to be, or is that something that still has to be negotiated in that six months comment you made about the MOU? Richard Adkerson : No, Brain, that would be defined and known and in effect upon signing of the MOU. Brian MacArthur - UBS: Okay. So when you re-export, that will all be laid out, so you have a clear runway for what you're paying? Richard Adkerson : As soon as we sign the MOU, we would advice the market of what its terms are and what would be effective immediately and so we will do that. Brian MacArthur - UBS: Okay. Then my second question is, sort of putting this all together, and you've been very good over the years about giving forecasts of EBITDA and cash flow at various prices every quarter. With all the moving parts now, you give guidance for \u201915, \u201816. We assume the resumption of exports in August from Grasberg, but in that, as Ralph brought up, you probably have better costs in 2015 than we used to, just because you pre-strip. You obviously have a tax now on the smelter, going forward. We've obviously sold Eagle Ford and adjusted that. Can I assume the stuff on page 21 now, given all those pluses and minuses, because it looks like it has changed a little bit, include all of those assumptions? Or is it pre- the MOU, if I want to think of that way, because there's a lot of moving parts here? Richard Adkerson : It does not include the impact of the MOU. Yet, it does conclude the Eagle Ford and the acquisition of the Apache interest and so forth. But it does not include the MOU since that has not yet been -- it said has not been signed. Brian MacArthur - UBS: And would it have the benefit, fair to go back to Ralph's point, because I think it's a good one that you would have some better cost structure in \u201815 and \u201816 than you did before, all else being equal, because you have done that all extra maintenance and pre-strip? Richard Adkerson : Well, this does reflect our current mine plan. Now we review that continually. And as you know Brian, over the years we\u2019re always looking for ways of incrementally improving it. And the guys will be looking at the ways of accessing higher grade material and with the pre-stripping the opportunities for that are much better than they have in the past. We\u2019re talking with our guys for example about having access to some very high gold grades in the pit that we might be able to access earlier than later. Kathleen Quirk : But Brain, the projections that are in the cash flow model are consistent with the mine plan for PTFI in the back on page 29. Brian MacArthur - UBS: Right. And just on that, I noticed gold's up again in \u201917, I assume that's just flow back from the delay and everything this year, and it looks like maybe that can come back forward, things like that is what you're talking about? Kathleen Quirk : Right. Richard Adkerson : That\u2019s right. Brian MacArthur - UBS: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Richard Adkerson : We\u2019ll have the chance for optimization and we\u2019ll keep you informed as we proceed with that. For everyone, we had a -- wait, we do have a couple of more. I\u2019m sorry. David is pointing out. Appreciate it. So operator, do you want to -- I think, see who else is on our list. Operator : Yes. Our next question will come from the line of Brian Yu with Citi. Please go ahead. Brian Yu - Citi: Great. Thanks for your endurance with this long call, Rich and team. On the duties where you said it starts less than 10 and it goes down to zero, does this apply to both the copper and gold, or just copper? And is there a portion of it that gets credited towards the smelter build? Richard Adkerson : It is own copper concentrates. So that would include the copper and gold. I mean, we don\u2019t sell copper and gold separately. We sell copper concentrate, which has gold and silver in it and we get paid for that concentrate based on the prices of copper, gold and silver metals, but we don't actually sell those metal separately. That\u2019s sold to the smelting company and -- but we get paid for it. So it is going to be only own exports and on concentrates, which will include all the metals in the concentrate. No, there is no credit on the smelters, that\u2019s a separate deal. But the way this thing works from a cost standpoint, is we only pay the export duty prior to the smelter, coming onstream. Once the smelter is build then we can reach agreement on building and so forth, the export duty goes away. Brian Yu - Citi: Okay. And when it goes to 0%, or planned to go to 0% in 2016, that would coincide with the start up of the smelter effectively? Richard Adkerson : No, not with the start-up of the smelter. These smelters are substantial industrial facilities and it takes time to build it. The scale down in the duty as contemplated by the MoU will be made on the basis of progress toward building this smelter. Progress is currently contemplated to be measured on the basis of cost expended and committed and the objective would be to say once you reach a point of no return, once you spin enough so that the government is satisfied that you\u2019re going to complete it then the duties goes away. Their view, the governments view and they\u2019ve been vocal about this was that the duty was not designed to raise money for the government but is to provide an incentive for the companies to build the smelter. Brian Yu - Citi: Okay. And what percentage in spend committed would 0% export duty tied to, is that like 50%, 75%? Richard Adkerson : I think its best given the current stage of what we are. It is not that are very hot. Its not the majority of the cost is what we\u2019re talking about. Its something less than that. But given that this thing is -- has not been singed yet. Although, we believe the terms to discuss with the government wants that are going to be adopted but it still has to be signed. I think, Brian, its best at this point, not to get that specific with what the terms are. Brian Yu - Citi: Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of Mitesh Thakkar with FBR Capital Market. Please go ahead. Mitesh Thakkar - FBR Capital Market : Good morning, gentlemen and thank you for squeezing me in. Just on the oil and gas side? I understand, when in May you guys announced the acquisition of additional interest in Lucius. Your working interest was supposed to go up to 35%, but it looks like now it is at 25%. Can you explain on a little bit, give us some incremental color around that? Jim Flores : Yeah. In the oil and gas transaction, the existing holders of the Lucius interest, additional partners have a preference for right of purchase to any sale that goes on within Lucius. And so we contracted to buy the Apache 10% interest. Two parties, the original partners exercise their pref rights, which cause us to exercise our pref right. So we got a reduced interest where Exxon and Impact, Japanese company, both liked the price we were paying for Lucius and exercise their right to get their percentage and it reduced our interest to the 5.1% versus the 10%, so that\u2019s the reduction. And therefore instead of it being a $1.4 billion acquisition, it was $900 million. Mitesh Thakkar - FBR Capital Market : Okay. Great. And just on Indonesia, the 2015 copper and gold guidance came down a hair and I was just wondering, if you are doing all the pre-stripping today, shouldn't it actually go up instead of going down or is the benefit just on the cost side? Kathleen Quirk : No. There was some minor changes we made to the start-up of the Deep MLZ in 2015, which affected the volumes in a modest way. The open pit really didn't change significantly from what we had previously. But we will project in a couple of months delay from what we had before for the Deep MLZ and that\u2019s the impact you\u2019re seeing. Mitesh Thakkar - FBR Capital Market : And that impact has nothing to do with the negotiations going on right now in the quarter? Kathleen Quirk : Correct. Richard Adkerson : No. During this whole period we\u2019ve been proceeding with the development of our underground resources, including the Deep MLZ and the Grasberg Block Cave. And so this is just an issue related to the completion of the Deep MLZ mine and it slipped roughly a quarter. Mitesh Thakkar - FBR Capital Market : Okay. Great. Thank you very much guys and thank you for being kind with the time. Richard Adkerson : Okay. Well, appreciated everybody\u2019s attention and being kind with your time. We had a lot to talk about and we will have a lot to talk about as we go forward. And we look forward to that if you have any follow-up questions, please direct them to David and we\u2019ll get them answered. Thanks a lot. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today\u2019s call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today\u2019s call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. I\u2019d like to refer to the cautionary language included in our press release and in the presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2013 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. On the call today are, Jim Bob Moffett, our Chairman of the Board, Richard Adkerson, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Flores, President and Chief Executive Officer of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas and we\u2019ve got several others from our senior management team here in the room. We\u2019ll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Richard who will be reviewing our recent performance and outlook. As usual, we\u2019ll open the call after our remarks for questions. Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $552 million, $0.53 per share for third quarter of 2014, compared with $821 million or $0.79 per share for the third quarter of 2013. There are several special items as you'll note in the press release included in this quarter's result which reduced net income by $115 million or $0.11 per share. These items included a ceiling test write-down on our oil and gas properties which impacted net income by $192 million, a charge of $47 million for an increase in deferred tax accruals associated with recent tax law changes in Chile. These were offset partially by mark-to-market gains on oil and gas derivatives totaling $76 million and $48 million in gains on asset sales and debt redemption transaction. The operating results, as you'll see reflect strong operating performance throughout the organization. Copper sales totaled 1.08 billion pounds and gold sales totaled 525,000 ounces; those exceeded the year ago quarter. Our oil and gas sales of 12.5 million barrels of oil equivalents exceeded the recent forecast but were below the year ago quarter, reflecting the sale of the Eagle Ford shale properties in June of 2014. Our results also benefited from the resumption of Grasberg concentrate exports in August following regulatory approvals from the Indonesian government late July. Our third quarter average realized copper price was $3.12 per pound that was below the year ago quarter of $3.28 per pound. Gold prices were also below the year ago at $1,220 per ounce versus $1,329 per ounce in the third quarter of 2013. And Brent crude prices average a $103.50 per barrel compared with the $110 per barrel in the year ago quarter. Our operating cash flows generated during the quarter totaled $1.9 billion and our capital expenditures approximated $1.9 billion as well. As we previously announced and we\u2019ve got additional information in the press release, we entered into an agreement in October to sell our 80% interest in the Candelaria and Ojos copper mining operations and supporting infrastructure to Lundin Mining Corporation for $1.8 billion in cash and contingent consideration of up to $200 million. We expect this transaction to close in the fourth quarter. During the quarter we redeemed $1.7 billion of Senior Notes with an average interest rate of 6.6% and additionally on October 15th, we redeemed $400 million of aggregate principal amount of our 8.625% Senior Notes. We ended the quarter with $19.7 billion of total debt and the consolidated cash was $658 million. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Richard who will be referring to materials, the slide presentation materials on our website. Richard Adkerson : Hey, good morning everyone. And we\u2019ve got a lot to talk about today. And I know this complicated geopolitical world we live in with the market conditions we face, we\u2019ve got some issues to talk about in Indonesia; and we\u2019re going to talk about the things that affect our business like in those areas and answer your questions. But I also want to put the situation in context for our company. Kathleen just talked about a quarter despite all these things where we had solid performance from our global operations, both in mining and oil and gas. In Indonesia, we resumed concentrate exports in all of this following the export ban that came into play in January and we are working to -- working with the government on our long-term contract situation. Then when we look at our strategy of growing the volumes of our business, and to do that, we obviously have to focus on making long-term decisions and making long-term investments and being consistent about it. You\u2019re seeing progress made of efforts that began back at the time when the Phelps Dodge Freeport merger in 2007. And the Morenci expansion is expected to reach full rates by the end of this year, the project is essentially complete and it's a major step for us. The Cerro Verde expansion, which is tripling of our output there, project that cost is estimated to be an excessive $4.5 billion is on progress, construction is underway heading for a start up in 2016. And our oil and gas business, Jim will be talking about the commissioning of Lucius this year and the Hollander project where we're completing the well for testing and production as part of our Inboard Lower Tertiary program, important project in that area. Beyond that our exploration activities and our planning activities for future expansions in our mining business, our oil and gas business continue to look at our large resource base and position ourselves for future growth over long periods of time. Kathleen talked about the sales of Candelaria that was a good asset. We found a bar willing to pay reasonable price. And we executed it, should be a good deal for both companies. For us, it\u2019s a step towards meeting our objective of generating cash to reduce our debt. And all of that has gone smoothly and we\u2019ll work in (inaudible) on all the efforts to close the transactions and have an effective transition. Speaking about copper markets, global macroeconomic situations have been overhanging the market, raising questions about demand. Europe has become a recent matter of global concern about its financial and geopolitical situation. People are concerned about growth rates slowing in China. But when we look at our business and the outlook and then talking with our customers, I mean we -- in our copper business, we sell directly to users of copper, we\u2019re not traders. We have a limited amount of activity with trading companies. And so we have direct cost to copper consumers globally. Here in the U.S., we\u2019re almost just a little less than 50% of the total marketplace for copper we sell around the world. And copper consumption continues to remain strong. Copper is affected by the economic situations in any particular country, but as we talk with our customers and we were with many of them during LME week, the outlook of the current uncertainty is bolstered by more positive outlook going forward. U.S. continues to grow at a moderate rate. Then when you step back from the demand side which is going to be affected by what goes on in China and the global economy, the supply side change challenge is which is the underpinning for the current copper price and for our optimistic view about copper going forward is really driven by the supply side issues. The number of projects were started, some of them delayed. The surpluses that were projected are not yet being realized and appeared perhaps the overstated inventories and customers of exchanges remain low and we see examples of new projects being delayed target forward and so the supply side picture remains the same and the positive long-term fundamentals for the copper market which drives our business are intact. On slide 7, you can see that we managed our business in an efficient way during the quarter and achieved good unit cost results. And you can see that for the quarter, our consolidated unit costs were $1.34 and the improvement in Indonesia with the resumption of exports during the quarter. We have a set of assets that allows us to be responsive to market changes. We showed that clearly in 2008, 2009 and then with assets that can generate profits at today's copper price levels and with the outlook being positive for the longer term improved profits as we go forward. Production volumes in North America reflect the Morenci ramp up and improvements at our mine in South America we were in lower rate sections of our mine. And you can see that Africa performed well as did Indonesia during the quarter. The strength of our company in the minerals business is our resource base. At $2 copper plans, we have over 100 billion pounds of proved and probable reserves reported under SEC standards. Beyond that, we have identified mineral resources associated with our existing properties of an incremental contained over 100 billion pounds. And we are working to take this mineral resource base to develop long-term investments. Finding projects to invest in requires time. And after we complete the current round of investments, there is going to be an active period of doing all the work that\u2019s necessary before we begin making significant capital commitments to new projects. But we have to be focused on doing that with the sense of urgency in order to be able to take advantage of these opportunities. Then beyond this big resource base, there is significant additional potential that\u2019s not included in our mineral resources and much of this has to do with sulfide deposits lying in North America associated with the oxide production that we have but Morenci and Safford with the Lone Star deposit in other properties in North America. At Tenke, we still are doing drilling activities, metallurgical analyses to identify the mixed or sulfide based beyond our existing production that we have there. El Abra has continued opportunities for our resource additions and we\u2019re working with partners in the area to determine the best way to deal with that and we have attractive rebuild project in Serbia. So that is a real strength of our company. Now where do we stand in this process? Well, this first round of projects that we are now completing, the Morenci project; the Cerro Verde project; we previously completed the Tenke project; we\u2019re designed to add about 20% to our production volumes. We started on these projects in 2010; by 2016 we'll be moving from a sale, annual sales level of roughly 4 billion pounds to 5 billion pounds. I recall with that we completed the initial development of Tenke, we completed a start up of the Climax mine, we had enhanced production from our existing operations. Now, we're seeing where we go from there. Grasberg through all the issues related to the export ban, the other issues we faced in recent times, we have progressed the development of the underground resource. This is a big project; very attractive long-term economics, because of the high grades of both copper and gold that are available to us. And we're working to establish Grasberg as a long-term asset with high production volumes, low cost. You can see that the schedule we're own, we provide for the commencement of mining from the extension of our existing DOZ mine, The Deep MLZ mine with this high grades that will begin by the end of 2015. And then once we complete mining the Grasberg pit, which will be 2016-2017 timeframe, we will commence mining from the Grasberg Block Cave underlying the pit and that\u2019s what we've been working on for several years and continue to invest in. All of that is part of our long-term plan. Now to just where we stand in Indonesia, we entered this Memorandum of Understanding in July to allow us resume exports. Export sales have been prohibited since mid-January as a result of a government policy, government laws and regulations designed to encourage in-country investment and downstream processing. We executed MoU; we agree to pay higher royalties, pay an export duty; we posted a bond to support a commitment to -- for a smelter development; and then we are continuing to operate under our existing cap. Our agreement with the government is that we will work to amend the contract of work provided we\u2019re provided assurances for our ability to operate beyond 2021 through the extension provisions of the cap to 2041 with assurances about our fiscal terms, operating rights and legal rights. We\u2019ve done work with the government own that; work remains to be done. Last week, there was inauguration of the new government; the President came into office; he is now announced his cabinet; and we\u2019re again working in a transition mode from the prior government officials with these new government officials. Our goal is to maintain a positive long-term partnership with the Government of Indonesia. We\u2019re confident we can achieve that because it\u2019s one of these things where it\u2019s everyone\u2019s best interest to do it. It\u2019s been a complicated political environment with the elections and we\u2019ve had to work in that environment. But we are confident; we\u2019re going to be able to achieve this because we've done such good things for the country, our employees and the reason and it's important to do country it's the right thing to do and we're going to work to do. Labor, we have had issues with labors that started two years ago when we had a strike; [rumors] drew a CLA agreement following the strike three years ago with the strike. Last year, we signed a new CLA agreement. We've had safety issues that have been reported. We had a collapse of the underground classroom area last year and then recently we've had two accidents. Union has been -- we're approaching these with a great deal of focus to ensure that our procedures are right and we\u2019ll handle the safety right. Safety programs are strong by international standards. Operations in Indonesia have had very low incident rates. Our standards are very high, but it's because of the tyrant weather and the workforce, when someone makes a mistake, unfortunately the consequences can be tough. So we're dealing with all of that. It's been -- let me just say an emotional time in Indonesia with the elections not only nationally, but in the region. And as a result of that, that's led to a current issue with parts of our workforce. 75% to 80% of our workforce is in place. But some workers are engaging in protest and demands relating to these recent safety issues where we\u2019re attempting to work with them. Some workers are currently not reporting to work and that\u2019s having some constraints on our mining activities in the pit. We\u2019ve been continuing to operate our mineral, our underground operations and our concentrate delivery systems, but it\u2019s having a current impact. And those discussions are going on right now. We\u2019re getting support from the local government, the local community and the central government. And we\u2019re in the process of working to resolve this. We\u2019re reaching out with the union leadership to have discussions with them as well. Again this is thing, sorts of things that we\u2019ve worked through in the past and we\u2019ll work through these issues, but that is a situation we\u2019re dealing with currently. Now stepping back, after we complete these projects where do we go next? We\u2019ve been engaged in Brownfield development studies. We have significant long-term opportunities for growth projects in Chile at our El Abra mine where we have a partnership with Codelco. We\u2019re talking with our partners about how to proceed with a major development project there that requires development of water sources desalinization pipeline project to power and so forth, but the great thing is we\u2019ve got a huge resource. And so those are issues we\u2019re working on. At our Bagdad mine near Prescott here in Arizona we have a very significant large sulfide resource that has the capacity more than double our mill rates. We\u2019re working on developing the necessary steps with water land to develop pro-tailings areas and so forth to move forward with that. In Tenke, we have the resource that allows for growth. To take the next step we require development of power resources for the area. And we are working with the government and other companies in Katanga to deal with that. That's a necessary step to allow us for the long-term development at Tenke. And at the Safford mine in Eastern Arizona with the adjacent Lone Star resource, we have about five years left on our oxide, current oxide production. We're looking at a stepped opportunity there to supplement that oxide ore with ore from the Lone Star deposit. And then at Lone Star and at Safford, we have a significant sulfide resource that will allow for us to deal with that. So that is kind of a line up before we're going and we'll continue to report for. We have from last \u201813 and \u201814 these, we have these 3D models, models that allow us to say grow hole results and project the geometry of resources and we thought we\u2019d share a couple of those with you at Morenci where we\u2019ve just completed an expansion of our mill. But the opportunity there because of this huge potential resource that\u2019s shown on this slide for a very large scale milling expansion in the future is something that is become increasingly more attractive. At Lone Star, adjacent to Safford, a deposit that\u2019s been known about for decade now is because of the ability to take advantage of resources and the drilling and exploration analysis we\u2019ve done is showing a huge resource potential. These are in the U.S., today in the U.S., because of the improved energy situation coming from the shale oil and gas; development with attractive energy costs; because of the flexibility of U.S. labor; the support we have near in Arizona from the local government for Brownfield development expansions makes these things very attractive. Jim Bob, would you want to say a couple of words about the potential projects? Jim Bob Moffett : (Inaudible) average day two good examples Morenci and Lone Star that shows it is Brownfield and related the property that we acquired from (inaudible) iceberg is in there stat oil is there, tip of the iceberg with a big value of the iceberg down their own surface. Remember, the only different oxide ore (inaudible). So, if you look at this and see the growth have you build and (inaudible) need this (inaudible) a non-potential this would be daily (inaudible) in the year and rest of the world. So if you realize the most stable sign we have find into your projects, we shouldn\u2019t have with the infrastructure and on a year or so potentially Africa, as mentioned earlier 60 kilometer (inaudible). Richard Adkerson : Great. Thanks Jim Bob. Now, just closing we're really excited about the business. It's tough business. There are challenges we have to face. And over the years, we're confident about our ability to do that and we've got a track record of doing it. Great set of assets, great people, great technology; and then on page 15, you can see where we have right now with insight five mines to be world class mines and those are very, very difficult to find with 400,000 to 500,000 tons of annual production. That's again the world and then all these resources that while we won't be spending capital on, in the near term we'll be very disciplined about that. We're going to be focused on the shareholder returns. It gives us a great deal of excitement about this part of our business. And now Jim shares that excitement about oil and gas business and I\u2019ll let him takeover. Jim Flores :  Thank you Richard and good morning everyone. As Kathleen articulated in our opening comments, oil and gas business is doing well. Our sales of 12.5 million barrels of oil equivalent in the third quarter were slightly above the July estimate but it was impacted by our earlier $3.1 billion rationalization of the Eagle Ford Shale assets in the second quarter. We continue to have good steady production performance in California and our Deepwater Gulf of Mexico while higher margin barrel of oil come from. The cash operating margin was $600 million for the quarter and with the $48 barrel margin, it was impacted by the decent price activity and the Brent pricing, 68% of Gulf of Mexico with the $65 margin and we\u2019ve done a good job over the summer to position the company for future growth out of our key area, which is the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Also our oil hedges that were carried over from the plains days come in handy with this current oil price where we have put to this rocket 90 bucks, they cost us $3 or $4 a barrel and so forth and when you start talking about $80, $85 oil in this type of market, volatility imbalance that there is a fire protection you need to make sure you continue to protect your capital budget, your shareholder returns that we\u2019re all pledged to protect. On page 17, the reserves and resource potential, we\u2019re trying to articulate here but what the rotation of our business has been from purely production assets that are flat to declining to something that\u2019s going to be impactful for the company with large growth. As you can see California and Deepwater Gulf of Mexico is a great comparison, two excellent oil assets. The cash margin obviously in the Gulf of Mexico much higher because the efficiency of production versus California with 79 versus 53. And the reserve bases are basically about the same 200 million barrels each but the growth potential and the reserve potential in both areas is dramatically different, from 400 million barrels in California to 4.4 billion in the Gulf of Mexico. Still with the same operating leverage, still with the same Brownfield complexion of reserve adds and also the facility and technical leverage that observes your individual project economics was like in the mining business, that's where our strong foot is. So, we're putting a tremendous amount of effort as everyone does in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, positioning our business, we'll talk about that portfolio rotation here in a second. In the meantime, we do have on the right hand side of the page a very large opportunity in Morocco to drill some (inaudible) plays and some deep structures there offshore that we're excited about. We\u2019ll start drilling those, the first one next year and the second in \u201816. I have passed over, but not left out our gas business. Our gas business highlight about the Haynesville and Inboard Lower Tertiary with 23 Tcf of gas potential there versus our 8 billion barrels of oil upside. With gas prices where they are, we still continue to put the harness on this. We're drilling a few exploratory wells in Inboard Lower Tertiary on the backs of the Highlander apparent success, even though we haven't put it on production yet. And as far as trying to delineate where the play goes to and try to make sure that we protect our resources there without going into full development just because of the gas price margin, obviously 285 Mcf or 18 bucks a barrel doesn't compete as well for capital as in deepwater Gulf of Mexico or California International does. So that gives a look at the 8 billion barrels of potential resource potential we have in the company versus our 430 million barrel reserve base in the additional 23 Tcf. We have a very deep portfolio of opportunities that we point out taking advantage of for many years and decades to come. Specifically to the third quarter business on page 18, the portfolio optimization comes on the back of the Eagle Ford shale interest sale for $3.1 billion at June of 14th. We reinvested $1.4 billion of deepwater Gulf of Mexico interest on a tax rate exchange for interest and picked up another 5% plus of our Lucius oil development and then Heidelberg oil development we\u2019re watching is just to the west of our Holstein facility in Green Canyon, pick up 12.5% both of those are operated by Anadarko. And then a new -- our Vito oil discovery that shale in Anadarko and Statoil had drilled a few years ago, it\u2019s a delineated structure that has a lot of development of leases and exploitation and leases around the mini basin that we have a significant interest in. And this will give us an infrastructure hub coming in the basin that will make our offset drilling exploratory and exploitation leases have the Brownfield economics that we enjoy in the rest of our portfolio. And a super high quality projects and high quality operators that we\u2019ll be doing business with either as a [non-IV] partner operating for them as well. So, this rotation into the Gulf of Mexico projects replaces the Eagle Ford production with extended growth profile starting at 2017, very value created, it was an ongoing -- it was an important ongoing step in our debt reduction plan with $1.2 billion of debt reduction in that after-tax proceeds. The graphs of the deepwater production reflects on 18 incorporates these assets, as well as in that resource potential comparison. You can see how more important these assets were compared to our outside the Eagle Ford, so about 10 times more potential from the 1.3 billion barrels of oil. And just to remind everybody about our strategic position in the Gulf of Mexico, the size of our assets, the assets are coming. This is our Holstein facility here, reflecting we have Marlin and Horn Mountain as far as these big production facilities are running at about 25% of capacity. And we plan to get into 100% capacity by the end of this decade. The major development projects that are coming on is Lucius, Heidelberg and Vito. Lucius is scheduled to come on here in the fourth quarter of 2014; probably first production that will impact us over the line field would be early \u201815 and our new guidance reflects those small delays at Lucius. Heidelberg is scheduled to come on third quarter of \u201816 and detailed schedule will come on sometime in 2019 right now even though it's unsanctioned. And then of course our exploration and exploitation opportunities, we're focused primarily with 85% of our dollars on exploitation the next several years and staying with our disciplined operating strategy of filling those existing facilities with high revenue barrels out of Gulf of Mexico. Kind of a global picture of our Gulf of Mexico here and starting from right to left; as I'm a left hander I like going backwards. We have a Marlin area Horn Mountain area and Mississippi Canyon area. And you see our Vito fits in very well between Mississippi Canyon and our Holstein Green Canyon area, the Vito in the lower Mississippi Canyon, Atwater Valley area and we\u2019re again able to keep the Canyon and Lucius. And it also reflects by asset areas where the 4.4 billion barrels of resource potential lie and it's a well balanced area, about 0.5 billion to 1 billion barrels per area and we continue to explore it as we get all of our seismic data in and our geosciences. And we think we have a long, long way to of developing Brownfield and tie back opportunities in these areas. One we really want to highlight this morning is our Holstein Deep play that we\u2019re drilling on right now which is on page 25. This is a discovery that we drilled a few years ago and after the Holstein purchase, we\u2019re able to pick the leases back up and develop it. And this is the log from our initial well in Green Canyon 643 discovery well and we\u2019re currently drilling well about 1 mile south of it or 1 mile and 1.5 mile south of it, southeast of it. And we\u2019re in the M13 sand right now core and we\u2019ve done M13 A and B sands as well as the D sands and we\u2019re looking at the M13 E sand and coring it and then we\u2019re going to drill down the M18. We think this is a significant discovery at this point in time with the confirmation well and we\u2019re learning a lot about our seismic as we drill more wells here and how much comp as we have gone all the way around the salt feature. It\u2019s a very large resource potential multi-pay in the Miocene and we haven\u2019t got into the lower territory of the Cretaceous at this point in time. So, this is going to be a dominant production event for us in 2016. At Holstein we have where we have about 100,000 barrels of capacity there, that will be able to bring on a significant portion of that 50,000 or 60,000 barrels a day in 2016 out of this the Holstein Deep drilling as we continue to drill around it that will complement with our Heidelberg and also Lucius ramp ups this year and the 2016 with Heidelberg. So we\u2019ve got a lot of production events coming forward that are already in the pipeline, some aggregate and the work done. And we're going to continue to drill the well and report on M18 sands and further the coring activity in our next call. Lucius and Heidelberg development projects, I gave you the update on those just refresh it by memory. We have 25% work interest there, so it's a very significant; we talk about 80,000 barrels a day and half a million cubic feet of 450 million cubic feet of gas and most of that is third party. And then we have a 12.5% interest right now on Heidelberg going forward. And that as you can see the spot already had the sale away and it's progressing on structure. And page 23 our Inboard Lower Tertiary/Cretaceous activities, we've been very active here. The Highlander project which is our top project at this point in time, we've had ongoing completion operations there. We've had some mechanical or equipment failure; we\u2019ve had to replace equipment that's put us about 30 days to 45 days behind. So we expect the flow test here in the fourth quarter, more oilfield stuff that we manage through. So, we're on track; we're just delayed. The Davy Jones 2, we're conducting flow test with Wilcox sands. At this point of time, most of the test at this in point has not yielded commercial results of hydrocarbons, but it's given us comp and it's in our flow rates from the deeper sands that we can overflow on lot of water and not much gas, but at least the permeability and pyrolysis there if not the productivity. Same thing on Blackbeard West No. 2, and then on Blackbeard East, we're going to be including a rig later this year to do a Miocene completion there and there is some stands there and we're drilling our Farthest Gate West exploratory well and spud it here in October and it's drilling towards 29,000 feet in South West of Louisiana and we also have our Lineham Creek project that we\u2019ll review and completion operations with the operator Chevron. So that\u2019s how together in oil and gas side had been active, we\u2019re rotating toward a very busy Gulf of Mexico season and for the next several years with our growth shift and driving production volumes and moving to cash flow production higher. Richard? Richard Adkerson : Okay. Thanks Jim. Let\u2019s look at the outlook slide, our update to our outlook for the year 2014. Current copper is projected to be 3.9 billion pounds that reflects the sale of Candelaria and some timing issues at Grasberg gold molybdenum and oil this also reflects the most recent information we have from the operative Lucius about the start-up from it, it\u2019s going fine, but it\u2019s starting just a bit later in the fourth quarter and some maintenance that we\u2019re having in our modern platform, some unscheduled maintenance, but that gives our current outlook for our oil production. You can see our unit costs outlook is consistent in a $1.50 range. Operating cash flows at $3 copper would be $5.8 billion for the year and our capital expenditures are consistent with our previous estimates. On a quarter-by-quarter basis, we have the projected sales volumes on page -- for the annual -- this is the annual, I\u2019m sorry on the slide here to myself. This is the annual sales volumes going from 2013 to 2016. Again copper reflects the adjustment for Candelaria and our most recent outlook for plans at Grasberg. You can see 2016 as we approach the completion of mining from the pit continues to be a big year. Some of that may go into 2017 based on the work that's been done there. And you can see the ramp up in our growth in oil and gas business as well. Now we get to the quarterly slide that I was talking about earlier, but it shows again the adjustments for the year and gives our quarter-by-quarter projection of our volumes. The site operating cost, union operating cost that we have by region is shown on page 27. It shows good performance at each one of our operating sites, as well as our sales by region. That's information for your reference and doing your models. And then on page 28, we have the fiction that we traditionally show, showing the cash earning capability of our business. At variant copper prices we now go from $3 to $4 and show operating cash flows ranging from $9 billion a year to $12.5 billion a year. Based on previous estimates, we've lowered the byproduct prices to $1,200 for gold and $10 for moly and $100 for oil and also reflect the sale of Candelaria and the adjustments of Grasberg volumes. The capital expenditures and how they break out between oil and gas, major mining projects and sustaining capital for mining shows the completion of the Cerro Verde project in 2015 and the drop of -- as a result of that. We remain committed to balance sheet management. We recognized that our long-term plans for developing our resource base can best be accomplished if we have a strong balance sheet. We\u2019re currently financially strong with an investment grade rating and our recent meetings with the credit rating agencies have been positive. We have acted in response to lower commodity prices to sell assets. We had a positive transaction with our Eagle Ford sale and now we\u2019ve sold Candelaria and we\u2019re continuing to look at other types of transactions to generate cash for balance sheet management. With lower commodity prices and with the situation in the non-investment grade credit markets is kind of the transactions are currently more challenging. But we\u2019re going to be creative, we\u2019re going to find ways of looking at the timing of our spending, we\u2019re going to -- we are looking at partnership arrangements that may give us the chance to share cost with others on attractive basis and we\u2019re looking at the potential for selling assets in a creative way. We\u2019ve got a long history of adjusting our business to varying markets and we\u2019re prepared to do this now. We\u2019re looking at our balance sheet and how best structure is for the long-term. So this is still work in progress. What we want to communicate today to our shareholders is that as a management team and as a Board, we remain committed to this process of reaching a strong balance sheet to support the long-term development of our resource base and the attractive businesses that we\u2019re in. So, that is our update of where we stand right now. We know you have a lot of questions; and Jim Bob, Jim and I, Kathleen and her team is here prepared to respond. Kathleen Quirk : Operator, we'll take questions now. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from the line of Curt Woodworth with Nomura. Please go ahead. Curt Woodworth - Nomura: Hi, good morning. Richard Adkerson : Hey Curt. Curt Woodworth - Nomura: I just wanted to drill down more into this capital allocation for the company going forward; obviously this year there has been pretty significant shifts both in terms of monetizing some of oil assets and then reinvestment in the deepwater. So, could you just comment on, do you continue to expect to pursue more bolt-on acquisitions in the deepwater and does the recent decline in the oil price change any thinking regarding exploration spending and/or potential to what you would want to do with California? Jim Flores : Okay. Curt, this is Jim. The aspect of spending, we\u2019re spending a minimal amount of exploration spending in the Gulf of Mexico, most of this development and exploitation spending around our facilities. So, as far as exploration and we'll be willing to change, there has not much of it been done. We are obligated to drill one well in Morocco on the exploration front, that's on the international side to go and call that the deepwater aspect. The bolt-on acquisitions and so forth, the market -- I think it's going to continue to be there from the seller\u2019s perspective. Our needs, when you look at our portfolio on page 20; we have a tremendous portfolio; sure we\u2019ll buy a few leases when the [March] lease sale coming up. I don\u2019t forecast as active a year as we had this year. Even though there will be opportunity, we just don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t have the need. As far as California and thinking about that, it\u2019s a monetization asset because of the flat production curve and growth. I think it kind of falls in the area where Richard talked about with the creativity and so forth; we still have partnership concepts and ways to do that. It\u2019s a tremendous asset to finance. And we\u2019re working on something as a project like that with partners to see obviously the market volatility. We\u2019re not rushing out to price something in this type of market; we want to see what things stabilize. And we have probably a little more constructive outlook on commodity prices than the banks at this point in time. They\u2019ve been calling for $80 oil for three years and so they finally got it; now they call it for $70 oil. So, we see demand around the world, we have a pretty good look at it is continuing to be healthy. There is a lot of financial noise in the markets right now and all this will calm down and we\u2019ll get back to business usual, maybe early as first half of next year and maybe take a little longer, but we don\u2019t think so. So we continue to have that I guess error and aquiver and we\u2019re talking about something that works that\u2019s very smart and value creative for the FCX stakeholders. And so that\u2019s more of a dry powder, but as far as rotating more Gulf of Mexico assets, we\u2019re probably developing those with the drill bit on our properties versus third-parties at this point in time. Curt Woodworth - Nomura: Okay. That's great. And then just a follow-up on the sulfide projects, Richard, can you give a sense for how the capital costs curve for say pounded capacity would look compared to some of the recent Brownfield expansions that you've been doing? Richard Adkerson : You know, Curt that I'm always reluctant to use averages because we are assessing these projects based on the individual economics of each property. The nature of the properties are similar though. And that the available sulfide projects that we have to work with are these large low grade deposits. And we are looking at the individual aspects of what it takes to develop them. In other words, if we compare an El Abra with our Bagdad mine and when we look longer range at Morenci and Lone Star, all of those things have attributes for development, permitting water access, power that vary significantly. So, if we match those up, we eliminate projects that don't fit in the portfolio, don't have good rates of return or ones that are not impactful or ones that we consider in a way we manage variations and prices overtime. So, with the real detail dynamic study of what to do and then we look at execution risk, which ones can be approached and achieved with the least amount of risk in terms of engineering design, tailings management it\u2019s a very dynamic kind of project. So, we can give you averages, but that\u2019s not really the way we look at. You look at the Morenci project that we just completed that we\u2019re ramping up now. Here we added our modern hot pressure grinding roll mill, goes along a 1940s area mill. We\u2019re taking material that we were wasting and now we\u2019re finding a way to economically process it. It\u2019s a lot different situation than at Cerro Verde where we\u2019re basically tripling where we had an existing site. We developed an innovative approach with a waste water system for the (inaudible) water. We had about a straight forward of building size you can have in this industry in terms -- and we have technology that we\u2019ve just put in place when we started the project and so we\u2019re tripling that and that gave us the opportunity to go for that. So, as I said, what I\u2019m looking forward to is having a day where we can bring a group of investors here in and go into some detail, this is the process we go through in analyzing this thing. The issue is -- and this is the reason that the outlook for copper price is so good in situations that we have where we have the resource we have the ability to do it, we want to do it as fast as we can, we\u2019re talking 10 years plus or minus. And that\u2019s what\u2019s so supportive of prices. Now if you\u2019re talking about a Greenfield project, you can just see -- might watch those that are going on around the world. And that\u2019s why I say when we\u2019re looking at market, that\u2019s really supportive of copper price. And grades are falling; mines are having to go underground to help those having to deal with these social issues. So, we think it's great business. Curt Woodworth - Nomura: No question. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America Merill Lynch : Thank you operator. Good morning everyone. Richard Adkerson : Hi Oscar. Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America Merill Lynch : Hi guys. I\u2019d like to get started with the $12 billion in net debt target that you had set for 2016, would the presumption that the California sale at current oil prices doesn't make sense. Would you be willing to be flexible with that, because 2016 appears to be a pretty good year for production from your projects? And in addition to that, I noticed that you have been continuing to buy back high cost debt which makes absolute sense to me. So, could you just provide more color around that? Richard Adkerson : Well, when we set the $12 billion target, it was just following the announcement of the acquisition of the oil and gas business. And we have faced some headwinds since that initial analysis with lower commodity prices, with the interruption of production in Indonesia and that's led us to find ways of selling assets and establishing our business. We're going to continue to do that. We are looking at capital spending, one of the attractive things in the oil and gas business it is; it is a business that has great more financial flexibilities than the mining business. Once we start spending on a mine like Cerro Verde, it\u2019s very difficult to pull the plug. So it gives opportunity for partner arrangements that could help us for timing and spending for selling partial interest. And so we\u2019re going through all of our business, looking at all of our capital spending seeing what we can differ, how we can deal with it, how we can generate cash. And we are going to be committed to reaching the strong balance sheet target. All of you run your models and many of you said Richard my model shows it\u2019s going to be tough for you to get 12 billion by 2016, you\u2019re right by the way. Does that mean, we\u2019re going to change our focus from getting to a strong balance sheet, none of us know what commodity prices are going to be in 2015, 2016. We have a great set of flexible assets, we\u2019re all very confident, we\u2019re going to reach the goal of having the kind of balance sheet that you -- most of you as investors are encouraging us to get to and we\u2019re going to work diligently to try to get there. While, we work to keep our production volumes up, execute deal with our issues in Indonesia, deal with our long-term growth plans to be disciplined about how we spend capital over the long range, we\u2019re going to deal with it. Jim Flores : And Richard, just to add one thing; Oscar this is Jim. You mentioned only California sale. Remember, we have a very strong hedge book on the oil from the standpoint; I\u2019m looking from where commodity prices are now and what the current financial community\u2019s outlook for it is through \u201815. So that gives us a bridge to still be strongly considering a transaction evolved in California that has -- that is like I said accretive to the stakeholder report. So we\u2019re in a unique position there to carry over some of those hedges on floors. So, I would not take that off the table at this point in time as part of our flexibility and bullets toward getting to the goals that Richard outlined because we're all committed across the board to making sure because we're talking about a business that lasts as Richard said for decades and 100 years, stock reserves. So the quicker we get to a balance sheet that we're proud of that we feel like it's going to give us the flexibility to accelerate the growth, the faster we'll all be happy right here. So if that helps you? Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America Merill Lynch : No, that's great. From my perspective, you already have a strong balance sheet. Then if I may, second question with regards to Grasberg. COW would notice the agreement that Vale reach in their Indonesian nickel operations ahead of the President taking office. And I understand it's a difficult situation but I was just wondering if you could just compare and contrast your situation with that of Vale because it seemed that they've got an extension to the contract of work that they've been happy for and in addition to that, it seems just based on the press released that they can go directly to the Indonesian Stock Exchange to this dispose off 20% of the stake they need to do. Richard Adkerson : All right. Well Oscar, let me say first of all, it's going to be a limit amount that I want to say about another company. You need to -- Vale will explain their situation but a key thing to remember for all of you looking at our situation in Indonesia, is that all of these contracts are different. They were signed at different times. Vale\u2019s operations like three forth go back; ours go back to the 70s, theirs go back at least to the 80s. And so where they ended up where we ended up with was contracts that have historical legacy and that have significantly different terms going into this process. For whatever reason, for some reason the Indonesian government has elected to treat nickel and copper differently. Valley produces an intermediate project called nickel matte, which represents 80% of the value of refined nickel. That product is allowed to be exported under Indonesian regulations without any restrictions without any duty. We produce a product called copper concentrate that is worth 90% plus 90% to 95% of value of refined copper and yet it\u2019s treated essentially as an ore and we\u2019re subject to these restrictions. I don\u2019t have any answer for that. But Valley\u2019s contract according to their press reports did not have legally the same degree of assurance in the contract authorized to extend. Legally our contract work has very strong provision that gives us the right for extensions from 2021 to 2041. Valley\u2019s contract extended to 2025 and did not have the same kinds of legal provisions. They\u2019ve breached some agreement with Indonesian government, we\u2019re not sure the details, but allows them to continue operate under a business license approach. And typically under a business license you have the right to operate, but you\u2019re subject to prevailing laws and regulations that can be changed. We\u2019re working with the government and it was acknowledged in our MoU with the need for us to have assurance about the terms of our operations beyond 2021 about our rise to operate physical terms legal enforceability because we're spending so much capital now between now and 2021 that won't be produced until after 2021. 75% of our reserves are produced after 2021. So, we have to be in a position of saying we'll spend this money, we've agreed to work with them on our smelter, but provided we have assurance of terms beyond 2021. Valley\u2019s situation is different and I don't know enough about it really to give you a detailed comparison in any event I don't want to talk about another company. But our situation is just what I described. Oscar Cabrera - Bank of America Merill Lynch : No that was great Richard. That\u2019s the sentiment I was looking for. Thank you very much. Richard Adkerson : Thank you, Oscar. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Ash Lazenby with HSBC. Please go ahead. Ash Lazenby - HSBC: Yes. Good morning all, just a couple of questions. Just if you could possibly expand a bit more you commented about the hedge book on to next year. If you do give us an idea of how significant the volumes are and sort of prices and to the extent that you can disclose that? And then secondly, just a point of clarification in terms of the CapEx and on oil, the $3.5 billion to $4 billion, how can we think about that in terms of flexibility? For example, if the oil price wasn't recover from these sorts of level, how much sort of flexibility do you have within those CapEx figures where you could potentially bring in some of that and free up some more and then boost the free cash flow generation. And what would that be In terms of the reduction of any of sort of production that you've currently got in the profile? Thank you. Jim Flores : Ash, it\u2019s a two part. On page 35 in our presentation and I need Kathleen to take it a later bit. 35 has got a detail on all our volumes. And we have 83 million barrels a day that\u2019s a hedge profile talked about in 2014 or 107 in 2015. So significant portion, all of our California volumes decided to do a transaction, so page 35 will help you there. As far as flexibility in CapEx, there is couple of different ways to do it, right, there is -- you can just reduce activity, but in spite of flexibility that oil and gas business has, we do have significant relationships in contracts with drill ships and the Gulf of Mexico, you have to plan your business much further ahead due to the regulations today and go through all that regulatory process and permitting that causes a little lengthier situation. I think the easiest or the best way to do it, start looking at the longer dated projects and develop joint venture relationships and basically bring in partners to share the spending. And that\u2019s something we\u2019ve been active in doing for the past several months and going to be continue to have those discussions, mainly out of solicitations from investors to us versus us really reaching out to other investors. So we\u2019re ramping up those activities to make sure that we continue to maintain that. Our front end loaded development activity versus doing too much drilling for the future while, even though it\u2019s development, during any kind of period of constraint commodity prices. So we\u2019re looking at building that flexibility. And I think you\u2019ll see the realization of it in the second half of 2015, if we\u2019re able to be successful there. I think in the first half of 2015, you would look at rationalization of assets like California; in the second half, you look at the realization of joint ventures reducing CapEx and we're going to proceed to have a flexibility in our program irrespective of where our prices are if it makes sense. Ash Lazenby - HSBC: Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead. John Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research : Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. I was taking a look at the commodity prices on December 5, 2012 when you announced the oil and gas acquisitions versus yesterday. It implies about 2.8 billion a year less after-tax cash flow. It would seem as though some of the CapEx is more, things like smelter in Indonesia came up small. And some of the CapEx that's a large project in midstream is hard to change like the Cerro Verde Mill ones you've started. Given the decline in cash flow, what are the levers of spending that you can turn off? And would it be less damaging to just omit the dividend as opposed to cutting off these oil and gas projects when they're permitted or the Peruvian CapEx in midstream and you've got probably some regulatory CapEx for [provision] control? And I know it's very complicated, it\u2019s a terrible question but the realities of markets in the markets. Richard Adkerson : Right. Well John, you\u2019re exactly right and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been dealing with. I mean we have as this situation has unfolded with the lowering of commodity prices, with the interruption we had in Indonesia, we\u2019ve been taking steps all along. In our mining business we scrutinized spending to differ delay spending all along and we\u2019ve done that in oil and gas and we\u2019re going to continue to do it. We are not in a 2008 crisis mode. Oscar made the point, thank you Oscar for saying that at the end of his -- as we answered his questions; we\u2019ve got a strong balance sheet. I mean we\u2019re an investment grade rated company right now. We\u2019ve had very positive discussions with the agencies. And so the issue of having to take the draconian steps that we took in the fall of 2008 where I came back from LME; we called our team together and said we\u2019re stopping spending right then. I mean we stopped Climax; we stopped the spending on Cerro Verde which was an earlier stage on Morenci. We just stopped all the projects; we cut the dividend; we even raised a little capital if you recall. We\u2019re not like that now. We don\u2019t have to go through that kind of analysis. But what we want our shareholders to understand is we\u2019ve got this commitment to work to strengthen our balance sheet in a rational way. We\u2019re not going to fire sale assets, we don\u2019t have to. We\u2019re going to find ways; we\u2019re going to look at all of our capital spending, see if things can be deferred with that of where we\u2019re honoring our contracts to spend where we\u2019re doing what we need to do. This is not something we're bringing our hands about here. We can manage our way through this and preserve our long-term growth. We're not having any discussions about cutting the dividend. We are just talking about managing our business. And we got the assets, the balance sheet and the way to do it. And we're going to do it in a way that John you're going to be happy with and we're going to be happy with. Jim Flores : Yes. John this is Jim. There is no well that support enough to drill before paying the dividend on the oil and gas side. They can be drilled later or that type of things just because of structure of our business as Richard talked about on the mining aspect. They are very co-relative of both sides. And I think what's impacted is trying to impress everybody about this company is that we're not only trying to put our business in great shape for the future, now we're in great shape for the present. At the same point in time, increase our flexibility about paying that debt all at the same time. That it is that hard to do, yes, we\u2019ve all acknowledge that. But that's the kind of goals and realizations that our Board expects and we're proud of the flexibility of our business to be able to even -- to discuss a proposal. And we've made some progress this year with Candelaria and the Eagle Ford sale and we've got more progress to do. So, we're all in the same boat and I think it will be beneficial for the shares irrespective where commodity prices go and that's what our job is. John Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research : Thank you, I'm a shareholder. Jim Flores : Thanks John. So are we, John. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Lee Gorin with (inaudible). Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Yes Richard, just two questions. First is that a lot of chatter regarding the copper tied up in financial deals, China has tied down. And I was wondering if you had any comment on that? And second, this is the first time I\u2019ve heard you talk of Serbia. And I\u2019m very curious about where that project lies as far as in your priority of your capital investments and new projects going forward between now and 2020? And a bit to that property, so it\u2019s very interesting. Richard Adkerson : Yes. I knew you\u2019ve been there, Lee. Great hearing from you, it\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve seen each other. This financing deal in China has always been murky as to what it meant; they had this fraudulent situation developed, but of course that for a period of time really raised everybody\u2019s concern. We\u2019ve talked about over the years at any point in time in China there is always some story about things that could be happening. And I got to tell you, I don\u2019t know all the details of the financing scheme, but when I look at the size of the Chinese economy and the amount of money that\u2019s being spent on development even in this lower gross situation and thinking about all they have to do to meet their development goals for the interior and what\u2019s they grid is pacing this year, next year with over 20 year period in terms of development, how much copper that involves. So, I got to tell you, I think a lot of these stories about inventories at any point in time, financing deals or slide shows that are probably really meaningful for companies that are traders, companies that have to make short-term statements about what to do with copper stocks and buying and selling. For company like ours, we\u2019re again focused on the longer term situation. Just like you as investors often have to be more concerned about short-term movement as to how you realign your portfolios, we understand that. But if we ever were to let short-term deals affect the way we run this business, then we're going to miss out on some huge opportunities because of the time it takes to get projects ready to go. Now Serbia : There is nothing in the natural resource business like Greenfield exploration, I mean nothing. It is idea of making some investments in exploration and finding a new asset and creating huge value. That's the happiest day you can have in a company like ours. And in oil and gas business it happens a lot more frequently than it does in the mining business; and that's again what\u2019s supportive about prices. You go back and you think what are the big success stories during my long career in the mining business from Greenfield exploration, they are few and far between. We have an active program, Rich [Lovell] and Jim Bob worked with and we fund junior mining companies around the world, own exploration concepts that have the potential to be big. We don't look at anything unless it has a potential to be big. So that's why you haven't heard much from us about this program. This does, this has a potential. You've been there. There have been some real exciting core holes that have been drilled. A lot of work needs to be done. It's in an area that's a traditional mining area. The government of Serbia is very anxious to see come in and invest. The current status is we're not actively drilling now. We're working on partnership arrangements with our partner there. I saw them briefly in London when I was there last week. And we're excited about it but it\u2019s longer term; a lot of work to be done but it is a Greenfield project that if it is successful could add a lot of value to our company. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you Richard very much. Richard Adkerson : Okay. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Joan Lappin with Gramercy Capital. Please go ahead. Joan Lappin - Gramercy Capital : Good morning. I have a question about the water bates flowing through on this recent test. I would presume that what you haven\u2019t said straight out is you have solved the problem of how to perforate these wells now and whether we\u2019re getting out hydrocarbons in commercial quantities is less significant in a way then all the problems that we had at Davy 1. So, my question is, am I correct in surmising that that the guns are now working and the ability to perforate at these steps is now perfected? And would that mean that would you ever go back to Davy 1; what this implies for Davy 2 and for -- and can you elaborate a little on whatever the problems were you had at Highlander? Jim Flores : Joan this is Jim Bob. That\u2019s a possibility, the other possibility is the reservoirs are different and the porosities and permeabilities were better at Davy Jones 2 versus Davy Jones 1. When we\u2019re in the business of producing salt water versus oil and gas, it\u2019s scientific but as far as economic and financial, all eyes are on Highlander, that\u2019s where we have even better porosity and permeability and core evidence and log evidence of having accumulations so that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused. The delays in Highlander were strictly oil field related equipment that failed that we had we retrieved out of the whole and just put us behind schedule. But we think we're getting closer and closer to the development test and we've got a little more work to do out there. And feel like here in the fourth quarter, we'll deal with kind of test of Highlander and put it in the sales very quickly, once it happens. So, that's what we're focused on; we're really just updating everybody over the operational results of those existing wellbores from McMoRan. Joan Lappin - Gramercy Capital : Well, I know you are not in a business of producing water. But I'm asking it's more specific question which is\u2026 Jim Flores : And Joan, I'd say that is a possibility but there is also another possibility. Joan Lappin - Gramercy Capital : What's the possibility? Jim Flores : The possibility is that it was -- it's purely mechanical with the perforating guns. But the other possibility, more likely possibility is just different, reservoir characteristics. So, I know I'm answering your question with two answers and either one a possibility that could be the reservoir characteristics has changed or the mechanical aspects of the guns, I happen to think and I have think it has to be reservoir characteristics, but that guns are an issue. But at the end of day, we're focused on Highlander and perfecting the flow rates of gas and oil there and that's what we're are concentrating. Joan Lappin - Gramercy Capital : Okay. So, you will not say that the guns are now working? Jim Flores : They've always worked. Joan Lappin - Gramercy Capital : Well, there is some question about that. But okay, thank you. Jim Flores : There you go. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Steve Bristo with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Steve Bristo - RBC Capital Markets : Yes, thanks. I just had a question on your hedging portfolio in oil and gas. And I know you commented on that being an asset possibly in the divestiture of California. Are there any plans to add to that portfolio because it was acquired with the plant\u2019s exploration and since announcing you guys have added to it at all? Kathleen Quirk : Steve, this is Kathleen. We\u2019ve not added to the positions, PXP had positions going into the deal, which will benefit us during this period of time. We continue to monitor markets and look at how a hedging program might fit in with our overall plans and capital spending. But at this point in time with these markets we\u2019re not looking to add to positions, but it\u2019s something that will continue to evaluate overtime in the future. Steve Bristo - RBC Capital Markets : All right. And then\u2026 Richard Adkerson : Steve I just might note too, company situation is different than [plains] and FCX. I mean we have a broader set of assets, stronger balance sheet. We\u2019re also short oil in a lot of our businesses. It\u2019s kind of different to match it all up piece-by-piece, but we\u2019re a big energy user, energy is 20% to 25% of our costs. It\u2019s from a variety of sources in our mining business natural gas, hydro, but all other component of it. So, when we step back and look at the overall business in terms of what our financing strategy should be, it\u2019s a different circumstance than having an independent oil and gas I think my point was. Jim Flores : Steve, this is Jim. I will just highlight and it gives us a lot of flexibility during the comparative time that other people do not have when it comes to valuations and financial flexibility of financing deals with California. So that was -- that\u2019s unique to us and unique to our situation. Steve Bristo - RBC Capital Markets : Okay, thanks. And then just on the debt target, it came up early about the $12 billion net debt target by 2016, but it sounds like you're sort of shying away from that and then you targeted just a strong balance sheet without a certain number around that. Is that correct in assuming that's where you're sort of leading into? Richard Adkerson : Look, all I'm acknowledging; let me just say I'm acknowledging is we have a target and we're working to get that, never anything magic about that target. We want it just to be as clear as we could to the marketplace at the time about trying to make it. It would be unrealistic of me to sit here and look at these circumstances and what we're dealing with and say if I got $12 billion, it\u2019s $12 billion. We're going to continue to work towards it. We're going to work to have a strong balance sheet. We're going to look at the time of when we can get there and I'm just being realistic than not being realistic. Jim Flores : And Steve, that is really the discipline that brings into all the spending, all our business, it sure keeps everybody focused on creating value. So it's been a beak and it\u2019s been endorsed by the board. So we\u2019ll continue to focus on it. Steve Bristo - RBC Capital Markets : Perfect. That's it for me. Thanks a lot. Operator :  Our last question comes from the line of with Wilfredo Ortiz with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Wilfredo Ortiz - Deutsche Bank : Yes, good morning everyone. Just a quick question on your volume guidance for copper for the fourth quarter, does this include any type of impact if like at Grasberg were to take place? And if it does take place, would it impact the whole operation or just partially a portion of the operation? Just wanted to get a sense as to what we're seeing as far as the guidance versus what could potentially happen if the strike doesn\u2019t sue post November 6. Richard Adkerson : The answer is it does not include any impacts of any kind of potential work disruption strikes or otherwise. And there is no real clear answer to your question. As I said, as we speak now there is a group of workers primarily in the Grasberg open pit who are not reporting to work that\u2019s in violation of our collective labor agreement. The work continues in our DOZ mine, in our underground development, in the mill operations and so forth. So, we\u2019re just going to have to work through this. It\u2019s unclear even if the union were to declare a strike; to what extent will the workforce respond to that. There is a -- it\u2019s a dynamic situation with a lot of interest represented even within the union. And so we\u2019re going to deal with it, could have an impact. That impact is not reflected in any of our numbers and there is one thing you can be sure of Indonesia, you\u2019ve got a real time news flow coming your way because whatever the union does is in the paper every day. And we\u2019re going to be active in our communications efforts to make sure the market is aware of what the circumstance is. Wilfredo Ortiz - Deutsche Bank : Understood. Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Okay. Thank you, Wilfredo. Operator : Now we will turn the call over to management for any closing remarks. Richard Adkerson : We appreciate everybody\u2019s interest and your good questions. We\u2019re going to work hard to achieve all these goals that we have. And we\u2019re very confident we\u2019re going to be successful. So, thanks for your interest in following our company. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Q4 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator instructions.) I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Q4 2014 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today\u2019s call are available on our website at www.fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors the financial press has been invited to listen to today\u2019s call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments we\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our Form 10(k) and subsequent SEC filings. On the call today are Jim Bob Moffett, Chairman of the Board; Richard Adkerson, Vice-Chairman, President and CEO; Jim Flores, Vice-Chairman and CEO of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas; with several other of our senior team here today joining the call. I\u2019ll start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who will review our recent performance and outlook using the slide materials that are on our website. As usual after our remarks we\u2019ll open up the call for questions. Today FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $2.9 billion or $2.75 per share for Q4 2014. There are a number of special items in the quarter which are detailed in the press release.  The net loss attributable to common stock included net charges of $3.1 billion or $3.00 per share in Q4, primarily associated with a reduction in the carrying value of oil & gas properties pursuant to SEC full cost accounting rules; and goodwill impairment charges as further detailed in the press release. These were partly offset by noncash marked to market gains on oil & gas derivatives contracts and a net gain from the sale of the Candelaria and Ojos mining operations which were completed in Q4. Copper sales totaled 972 million lbs. in the quarter and 3.9 billion lbs. for the full year. Gold sales were 377,000 oz. in Q4 and 1.25 million oz. for the year 2014. Our oil & gas sales totaled 12.1 million barrels of oil equivalents in Q4 and were 56.8 million barrels of oil equivalents for the year. Our average realized prices for copper during the quarter were $2.95 per lb. - that was below the year-ago period of $3.31 per lb. Gold prices averaged $1193 per oz. below last year\u2019s Q4 of $1220 per oz., and our average realized price for crude oil in Q4 was $78.02 per barrel, which included $7.77 per barrel of realized cash gains on derivative contracts. Operating cash flows for the quarter totaled $1.1 billion. Capital expenditures totaled $1.8 billion. As previously announced we completed the sale of our interest in Candelaria for $1.8 billion in cash during November. We ended the year with total debt of $19 billion and the consolidated cash position totaled $464 million. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Richard who will be referring to the materials in our slide presentation. Richard Adkerson : Good morning everyone, and we\u2019re thinking about all of you on the East Coast dealing with this snowstorm. It\u2019s even raining here in Phoenix so it\u2019s a strange year in a lot of ways. We\u2019re going to focus today on our company\u2019s response to the new commodity price environment we\u2019re having to deal with. The situation we face now in some ways is mindful of 2008 when the price of copper dropped 60% in just a quarter and a half. Beginning midyear in 2014 we saw the significant drop in oil prices, and oil dropped about 50% during 2014. Then in Q4 we saw copper prices drop, and copper prices dropped almost 20% in Q4, and then going into this year we\u2019re seeing further drops. Now, what does this mean to us overall? One thing, we\u2019re having to change our focus from our previously stated debt reduction targets by 2016, because under these commodity prices those targets are unrealistic. We will be seeing higher cash flows from our mining business as we complete projects and add volumes and reduce CAPEX, and we see 2015 as a bridging year to get us to higher cash flows that we have before us - even without increases in commodity prices. We want to emphasize we\u2019re not backing away from our objectives of reducing leverage, and going forward we\u2019re going to continue to prioritize debt reduction. We have a track record as a company of taking necessary actions and executing plans to maintain financial strength during periods of weak commodity prices, and that\u2019s what we want to talk about today. We\u2019re prepared to deal with whatever commodity price environment we have to live with. In many ways there\u2019s a disconnect today, kind of unlike 2008, between the current fundamentals of the marketplace and what we\u2019re seeing with commodity prices. But the market is what the market is and we\u2019re not developing plans that are based on an assumed near term quick recovery in prices. So that\u2019s kind of setting the stage for what we want to talk with you about today and we\u2019ll be prepared to answer any of your questions about it. Turning to Slide 3, we have made good progress in this moving towards achieving higher volumes from our business. The Morenci expansion is complete following the completion of the Tenke expansion earlier and the Morenci is expected to reach full rates in Q1 this year. The Cerro Verde expansion is physically more than 50% complete. We\u2019ve incurred a lot of the costs and contracted for other costs. We have a substantial construction project going on there. To date it\u2019s going well and we\u2019re targeting a 2016 start date at Cerro Verde. The Lucius project operated by Anadarko that we\u2019re a significant investor in has achieved its first oil production this month. We had a successful production chest at our Highlander project in south Louisiana that Jim will be talking about and positive drilling results in our deepwater projects at Holstein Deep and Power Nap.  As we previously reported we completed the sale of our Candelaria project in Chile. We had a successful $3 billion senior note offering which essentially allowed us to repay all of our 2015 maturities and also to retire some higher coupon debt.  We are today talking about a plan to take aggressive actions in response to these commodity prices. We are cutting our capital expenditures in 2015 by $1.5 billion - that\u2019s over a third decrease in our oil & gas CAPEX. And we engaged in a process to obtain third party funding for some of our Gulf of Mexico development projects - things that this company has done before. And we\u2019ll be talking about how we\u2019ll be using that to mitigate our capital expenditures further. Kathleen reviewed the financial highlights on Page 4 and I won\u2019t repeat those. Those are there for your purposes. You can see that our unit cash costs are in line with our guidance for the year, about $1.50 per lb. Turning to Page 5 I mentioned the status of our expansion projects. The three projects that we undertook to substantially increase our volumes are on track. Our capital expenditures will be declining. We\u2019ll have substantial free cash flows beyond 2015. And in the oil & gas business we\u2019ve had strong operational performance. Our efforts continue to identify substantial resources that will be the basis for future growth with lower risk development opportunities, and we\u2019re reducing spending in response to today\u2019s conditions without eliminating that opportunity for future growth. And you can see in these charts just how significantly, suddenly and recently commodity prices have dropped. We had roughly two years of copper prices that bounced around between $3.00 and $3.50 before this drop; we had three years of oil prices where Brent was over $100 and then this sudden change, as I said, in many ways appears to be disconnected from the current fundamentals of our business. Note on the copper chart on the left side of the page our stock price of course directionally follows the movement in copper prices. But I think the global exchange stock is one indication of this disconnect between today\u2019s prices and fundamentals. Historically in weak economic times exchange stocks and inventory sales by consumers will be increasing, and today while we\u2019ve seen a recent growth with a small uptick in global exchange stocks they\u2019re still low by historical perspectives - and certainly not rising to the point that would indicate a drop in prices like we\u2019ve seen. Page 6 talks about what our current focus is and that\u2019s protecting our balance sheet. We\u2019ve completed $5 billion of asset sales, we\u2019ve reduced CAPEX. We\u2019ve, as I mentioned, did this bond financing to strengthen our liquidity. We are continuing as we speak today to work with our management team and we\u2019ll be working hand-in-glove with our Board on a real time basis as we go forward in 2015 to decide what further actions need to be taken. We\u2019ll be monitoring the state of commodity prices, the performance of our business, how we\u2019re doing in terms of meeting these plans, completing our project at Cerro Verde for example. We are looking for partners to help provide funding for our CAPEX in the Gulf of Mexico as I mentioned. We\u2019re working with our bank group and holders of our bank term loans about dealing with issues that would further improve our financial flexibility. We\u2019re in good shape now but we want to make sure that we\u2019re taking every step to stay that way as we go forward. In Indonesia as we work with the government to get our contract of work issue resolved, we just this week signed an extension of the MOU that we had signed last July. And in that MOU we responded to a very strong position of the Indonesian government about the advancement of development of a smelter in Indonesia. And we are working with partners and with site preparation and construction plans to go forward with that, in conjunction with getting a resolution to our contract situation. As we look forward it\u2019s what we are planning to do - we are presenting a plan for you here today. And that plan involves reduced CAPEX, reduced costs and pursuit of capital expenditures where it\u2019s economically rational for us to do so. The plan we\u2019re presenting to you today includes a continuation of our current cash dividends to our shareholders. We\u2019ll be working with our Board to review all aspects of our financial policy and our financial planning as we go forward. And I think you can judge from our past history that our Board\u2019s going to be prepared to do what\u2019s necessary to protect the liquidity of this company. Page 7 shows the cost reductions and deferrals that our plan today involves : a significant reduction of $1.5 billion in capital expenditures with $1.2 billion of that coming in the oil & gas business. And we\u2019re taking advantage of every opportunity that we can of achieving cost reductions in all of our global operations. Particularly in our mining business lower oil prices is leading to lower costs, and also lower commodity prices in terms of some of our input costs is also giving us the opportunity to achieve a lower cost structure. And we\u2019re going to take every advantage of that that we have. The strength of this company, the strength of Freeport-McMoRan lies in our long term assets, and those remain in place. And as a company we remain highly positive about the future outlook of our business even as we deal with the current situation. We have substantial long lived reserves both in our mining business and our oil & gas business. These reserves are in a diverse portfolio of world-scale copper assets and a strategic position in the Gulf of Mexico, taking advantage of existing underutilized and well-placed infrastructure. We have a very large, valuable resource potential. In copper we have over 100 billion lbs. of proved and probable copper reserves at $2.00 copper, and roughly that same amount of mineralized material at a $2.20 price range, and additional resources beyond that. So we have within our company the resources for long term profitability and growth; and in the same way the oil & gas business, our resource base is very large and gives us a basis to have future growth there. Now talking about the copper business, you know, I referenced the fact that there\u2019s an apparent disconnect now between the copper price and market fundamentals. Clearly the market is trading on the basis of the oil price decline and the impact generally on commodity prices. Traders are looking at the relative values of metals in relation to oil; they\u2019re looking at the relative value of copper in relation to other metals. And what we\u2019ve seen is a significant decrease in prices, but inventories remain low; the fundamentals of our business in dealing with customers remains relatively strong.  The market is relatively tight, and from a supply standpoint the consensus expectations of very large surpluses that were expected in 2014 have not materialized. The surplus expected in 2015 appears to be much smaller than anticipated. Supply is coming on slower; disruptions are more frequent. And beyond 2016 the market remains to be uncertain. All of this reflects the global macroeconomic, political uncertainty that we see around the world. China is in a slower situation but the government is responding with economic stimulus. And in fact there\u2019s a lot of positive things in China. Imports rose by 12% year-on-year in 2014 and set records at the end of the year. Domestic cathode production set new records in November and December. State grids announced an increase of 9% in their spending next year and so even though China\u2019s growth rate is slowing it\u2019s still consuming a lot of copper. In the US the fundamentals are stable. Despite the price volatility our customers are continuing to have confidence in their business going forward. Supply side issues still significantly underlie this market. As I said, the forecast for large surpluses has not materialized. Exchange stocks are low. New projects are facing delays. As you read Q4 earnings reports and announcements you\u2019ll be struck by the number of production declines that are being announced around the industry.  Grades are falling; people are constraining CAPEX - all of this will be very supportive of copper prices as we go forward. Lower prices is taking a lot of scrap out of the marketplace and that\u2019s going to be supportive of prices. So we continue to see long term fundamentals. The stronger dollar is an issue for the marketplace and that\u2019s one thing about it. Now, I want to refer to Page 10 which is a chart I\u2019ve used before, but just to put all this in perspective about what the world is going to need for copper. The top chart is total copper consumption - this includes consumption of directly used scrap in addition to consumption of refined metal. And if you assume a growth of 2.5% over the next ten years, and that embeds a growth rate in China that\u2019s half of the growth rate of the last ten years, the market is going to require another 7.6 million tons of copper. And over this same period existing mines are going to decline. Brook Hunt expects existing mines to decline by over 3 million tons. So that\u2019s 10.7 million tons shortfall that\u2019s going to need to be made up over the next ten years by expansions, new projects and scrap. To put that number in perspective, in 2014 the top ten mines in the world are estimated to produce less than 5 million tons. So the requirements for the next ten years are twice the annual production of the ten largest mines in the world. We have to get through this current situation but the fundamentals of our market are very positive and we\u2019re very optimistic about it. Page 11 shows our mining unit production cost experience for Q4 - roughly in line with what we had guided to in our Q3 earnings release. It does reflect the sale of the Candelaria operations in early November and it does reflect in Indonesia some higher royalties and export duties that we have agreed to pay in connection with these MOUs that we signed. But you can see that our cost experience continues to be positive. Cerro Verde is in the stage of full-blown construction now. We have 12,000 to 14,000 workers there to have a project that will be the world\u2019s largest concentrating facility. The construction is advancing and is expected to be completed late in 2015, and we\u2019ve incurred roughly three-quarters of the cost of the project to date. As we look at constraining capital quickly it was clear that delaying Cerro Verde was not economic for our company because of the stage of the project, the amount of money that\u2019s spent and the coming volumes beginning in 2016 and going forward. We\u2019re going to be focused on managing the completion of that project. In Indonesia we continue to engage in active discussions with the new government being led by Joko Widodo to amend our contract or to extend our right to operate beyond 2021, the expiration of the existing contract or the initial term of the existing contract. We\u2019ve approached this process with an aim of keeping a positive long term partnership in Indonesia. We\u2019re focused on working with the government for the economic development of Papua and to provide significant benefits to the overall Indonesian economy. Our existing contract continues in place as we speak and we are focused as we go forward in being responsive to the aspirations of the government, the people of Indonesia; and taking into consideration our need for assurance of legal and physical terms to support the major investments that we\u2019re making. The MOU that we signed last July has been extended until July 2015. We this week got an approval to continue to export. We had a six-month license which needed to be renewed and it has been renewed, and as I mentioned we\u2019re advancing plans for the new smelter project in parallel with our [inaudible] amendment and we\u2019re all focusing on Papuan development during this process. At Grasberg we\u2019ve completed development of the access to our underground ore bodies and are continuing with the development of the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ mines. So development capital of almost $3.0 billion has been spent to date and in total $2.3 billion from Freeport, and our share of development capital is expected to average $700 million a year over the next five years. This is an important project as this replaces the production coming out of the Grasberg Pit. The Pit is now expected to extend until the end of 2017 roughly - that\u2019s been delayed somewhat by the labor issues we\u2019ve faced in recent times. Just let me say we\u2019re making progress with those now and expect during Q1 to return to normal levels of operations. While we\u2019re not spending significant capital on further development projects in the mining business we are continuing our studies on the potential for a very large scale expansion at El Abra, for the further expansion of our Tenke Fungurume project in The Congo where operations are going well and we have a resource that provides us optimism about future long-term growth; and in our US mines where we have large sulfide resources in our Bagdad mine in northwest Arizona and the Safford Lone Star mine where we have an enormous resource. All these things are the future for our company and we\u2019re continuing studies without spending current capital on the projects. Jim, I\u2019ll turn the mic over to you and let you talk about our oil & gas business. Jim Flores : Thank you, Richard. Good morning. 2014 was an outstanding year operationally for the oil & gas business, primarily Q4. We successfully rotated out of the low-margin shale project. We had one of the better shale plays out there in Eagleford and now they\u2019re under a lot of pressure obviously with the low prices. In that rotation we were able to increase interest in our high-margin areas like the Gulf of Mexico, mainly increased interest in Lucius and Heidelberg.  We had excellent revenues during the year of $4.1 billion, cash operating margin of 2.9% and almost 57 million barrels of oil equivalent in production and sales in 2014. The drilling results we had in Q4 were mainly successful - Holstein, Deep Dorado, King and Power Nap were all four significant new development opportunities for our company. They\u2019re also the first three truly development projects adjacent to our world-class infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico that gives us all the operating leverage and the high margins to our business. The aspect of the long-term play of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas of developing resources in and around our existing infrastructure and driving production and reserves higher, while reducing our costs - because most of our costs there are fixed - is off to a great start. Although we\u2019re obviously going to take action here to reduce our CAPEX exposure because of the low commodity prices, operationally the plant\u2019s working just perfectly. On the ILT, Inboard Lower Tertiary crustaceous, our significant discovery in Highlander - we were able to float test the Highlander well at 43.5 million cubic feet of gas per day, the first production below 29,000 feet on the Gulf Coast onshore. And we were able to prove that we have a large gas reserve there in Highlander, and I\u2019ll talk a little bit about that going forward. In California we had excellent execution, drilled over 107 wells with over a 100% success ratio as expected. So all in all we were rolling out of \u201914 looking forward with a lot of optimism to \u201915 until Page 17, the price of oil fell out of bed and the market\u2019s gone down 50%, 60%. This was unexpected from a lot of people\u2019s standpoint. We thought oil would get a little soft but we had no idea it would find a mind of its own and create this kind of calamity. The oil & gas market is under severe stress. Our business is as healthy as anybody\u2019s out there because of the rotation out of the shales and so we actually have economic projects to go forward on. At the same point in time, with our cash flow impaired and the ability of the company from a standpoint of funding its obligations, we need to raise some capital. And the way we do that is take our development projects and find outside funding, just like we did in 2008.  You\u2019ll see the drop - in 2008/2009 we were in the same situation and we took our Lucius project, right after the financial crisis, and we were able to do some project financing there. It\u2019s a nice rate of return for our investors as well as us, and we basically got 75% of the project free of charge going forward. And it just came on production as Richard said in January of this year. So we\u2019re going to repeat that financing going forward, and the only way we can do that is because of the strength of economics of the project and the operational leverage tied back to our facilities to where investors feel like they have a great shot at buying oil low with good execution, and being part of a great project that\u2019ll enjoy prices at a higher level in the future. So we\u2019re in a unique position to raise that funding, and also having done it before I\u2019ll go over the Lucius case study in a second. The other operational highlights, the steady production from Point [Inaudible], California - we\u2019ve completed our maintenance at Marlin, we sold 12.1 million barrels of sales in Q4. Cash operating margin was about $0.5 billion and $64.0 million worth of debt hedge realizations with our hedge book that does extend into \u201915, with I think the mark on that is about $500 million in the positive right now. Responding to market conditions we\u2019ve gone onto a significant capital reduction of 34%, $1.2 billion of announced CAPEX cuts. That\u2019s basically from our previous $3.5 billion budget to $2.3 billion. And when you\u2019re making these budgets based on risks/success, when you go through a Q4 where every well works you obviously expect your budget to increase the following year. So it\u2019s a direct $1.2 billion discount or reduction in CAPEX, 34%, but in real terms it\u2019s probably much higher than that based on the success and the development that we\u2019ve caused because we obviously at it risked in our budget. It all rolls over into a 43% discount in our capital spending in 2016 of $1.7 billion. Now the development joint ventures we\u2019re going to be talking about will be in addition to these reductions and we\u2019ll go through that, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ll talk about deferring our discretionary spending. We\u2019ll focus on our highest priority projects. Anything marginal, anything discretionary or anything kind of out on the front tier has been shelved. And when you reduce spending this much you slow growth and you preserve the resource value for the future and better prices, when economics are better. It\u2019s just a function of reducing capital and reducing activity, and then lever the past successes therefore for funding arrangements. And that\u2019s what Page 20, the Lucius case study, is all about. We had discovered Lucius, drilled a couple delineation wells and established a reserve, and we basically project financed it with $450 million of 8% convertible preferred into 20% equity positions. We warranted everything else and it ended up being about 25% at the end of the day, and with a $300 million bank revolver at the subsidiary level. That allowed us to fund all of the development at Lucius. It basically came in on time and on budget. And this is where we had a third party operator, it was right after the financial crisis and at the time we did the funding the moratorium for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico was still in place post the Macondo spill. This situation we have going forward, we have projects that come on in 18 to 24 months, that come on much faster. We\u2019re the operator; we own 100%. We have the equipment in place, the plan in place to execute on so we\u2019re in a much better position physically and operationally and interest rates are much lower to repeat this financing going forward. We had these thoughts in mind anyway going forward because we had sold our Eagleford production and our cash flow was going to be down in the oil & gas sector of our company, so we just accelerated those plans. We can do this multiple times. We\u2019re going to do it at Holstein and Heidelberg - those are the two developments we\u2019re going out with first. Then we can do King and Marlin and then Power Nap. We can continue every successful resource we establish, we can project finance this. We think it\u2019s at very favorable rates to the company and really highlights the true value of our exploration business to our company rather than just developing reserves on our balance sheet to be able to leverage that part of the business. Page 21 is the list of these projects we\u2019re talking about. Holstein Deep and Heidelberg, one\u2019s green, one\u2019s blue will be in our initial joint venture. We\u2019ve already done Lucius and then we have in the black Dorado, King and we expect to drill Kilo Oscar and the rest of them in mid-2015. Power Nap is part of our Vito project which is a great validation of our Vito acquisition last year. It\u2019s the first exploratory well out of that strong portfolio that has found some fantastic reservoirs. So we\u2019re off to a great start establishing our inventory for our development joint ventures in the Gulf to drive those high returns to shareholders. I mentioned earlier about the Inboard Lower Tertiary crustaceous update at Highlander. This is a significant geologic and engineering milestone. It is still producing gas below $3.00 so economically challenged, therefore we\u2019re idling most if not all of this activity this year to see what happens with better gas prices. The Highlander well should be on here in production in Q1 - we\u2019re going to be monitoring that closely and pressures and so forth. But all indications are we have truly validated a significant reservoir in the gas business but we need better economics to go the width. And obviously the best economics, the best cash flow are going to be on the oil side of our business in the Gulf of Mexico. So a great success to the team. It\u2019s been a long time coming on the flow test and the success, and then we\u2019ll deal with it and develop it when prices are a little bit better. Richard? Richard Adkerson : Alright, thanks Jim. Now before we get to questions we\u2019ll take a view of our 2015 outlook. On Slide 23 is our sales outlook which is for copper, gold, molybdenum and oil consistent with our previous guidance. Unit costs of $1.53 for copper, $18 a barrel equivalent for oil is also consistent. Operating cash flows, we\u2019ll show a further analysis of this : at $2.60 copper and $50 oil our plan would provide $4 billion of operating cash flows. Each $0.10 of copper is $350 million variance in that. Our current plan for capital expenditures is $6.0 billion. That\u2019s a reduction from $7.5 billion of earlier guidance, and this does not reflect the participation contributions to be made under these arrangements that we\u2019re currently pursuing that Jim talked to you about, where we\u2019re looking for partners and project-type financing to come in for our developments in the Gulf of Mexico. Page 24 shows our production outlook and I mentioned earlier the growing volumes that we\u2019ll be seeing in our business beyond 2015. 2015 shows $4.3 billion growing to $5.4 billion. You can see increasing volumes of gold as we get closer to the bottom of the pit, or completing mining at Grasberg; and our volumes for molybdenum and oil & gas sales. Quarterly sales this year : Q1 is expected to be our weakest quarter from a volume standpoint. That\u2019s just a function of our mine plans and is a ramp up of our labor issues, but by the end of the year we would see increasing growing copper sales throughout the year.  Our sales by region are shown on Page 26. The growth in North America is primarily Morenci, the decline in South America primarily reflects the sale of Candelaria. And you can see Indonesia growing as results of improved productivity from our labor group. Our unit costs for 2015 are detailed on Slide 27. Notably we see a decrease in our site production delivery costs on a unit basis from $1.90 to $1.81, but that is offset by higher royalties and export duties in Indonesia - but still at a very attractive rate in the $1.50 range. Now, EBITDA analysis, cash flow analysis is shown on Page 28. We show a variation, again with oil at $50 and copper varying between $2.50 and $3.50. This is an average of 2016 and 2017. You can see cash flows of $6.4 billion a year average at $2.50 and over $8.00 billion at $3.00. Sensitivities are on Page 29. Our biggest sensitivity of course - copper price. A $0.10 change is $350 million in cash flow. For oil, $5 is $150 million in cash flow. So those are going to be key factors we\u2019ll be watching as we go forward. Page 30 shows our declining capital expenditures going from projected $6 billion in 2015 to just over $5 billion in 2016. Again repeating this does not reflect the plans that we\u2019re on right now to have a significant portion of these cash flows in the oil & gas business fund through participation by third parties. So that is our plan. I mentioned earlier our strong commitment to strong balance sheet management. At year end we had no borrowings under our $4.0 billion bank credit facility. We also have a separate $1.8 billion line of credit at Cerro Verde to help fund that project along with the cash flows that the project is generating from its current operations. We had $425 million drawn under that separate facility at the end of the year but that\u2019s another aspect of our balance sheet management. We have a strong resource base, strong cash flows and capital discipline. We\u2019re taking the steps already to deal with this current situation and we\u2019re going to be responsive to what we have to deal with. And as I said, this is going to be a real time effort, working hand in glove with our Board to make decisions as we go forward. In summary we want to protect our balance sheet and liquidity and we\u2019re going to complete our near term mining projects, continue with our oil & gas investments where that makes economic sense; work on these third party investments - with the primary goal, the imperative of preserving this really attractive and large long-term asset base for the future benefit of our company. So with that we will open the line for questions. And Jim Bob, Jim and I are here with Kathleen to respond to whatever questions you might have. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions.) Our first question will come from the line of Michael Gambardella with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Michael Gambardella : Yes, good morning, Richard. In the past, I mean since you made the oil & gas acquisitions a few years back you\u2019ve consistently said that the oil & gas part of your business would be self-funding. And I know you talked a little bit about how you\u2019ve done some of those things in the past, but do you still think you\u2019ll be self-funding for 2015 given what you see right now? And how specifically do you plan to address that? Jim Flores : Mike, this is Jim. That\u2019s a target. It\u2019s going to be difficult to be totally self-funding with the horrific drop in prices. And our plan was to be self-funding to replace the revenues that we did not have in 2015 due to the sale of the Eagleford. So we\u2019re moving toward additional funding sources and so forth, but it\u2019s going to be a challenge to make it dollar for dollar. Hopefully we can raise about $900 million in this first development joint venture off of the $2.3 billion to get close to it. And I know even though it\u2019s January I\u2019m optimistic we can get another one done as well but we\u2019ll see what the market holds. But we\u2019re going to try to offset as much as we can. Richard Adkerson : And Mike, I mentioned here in my comments that we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re having to deal with this sudden change in the cash flows from just how quickly prices are moving - not for oil & gas but also for copper now. And 2015 is a bridge year. I mean we\u2019re going to have higher volumes in 2016 so the way we\u2019re thinking about this issue for our goals for oil & gas planning and so forth, and managing our balance sheet is really how we deal with this over a two-year period. We have the financial flexibility to do it but that\u2019s really the focus of where we\u2019re getting to. And we\u2019re going to be monitoring, see what prices do and so forth but that\u2019s really the way we\u2019re looking at it. That\u2019s our long-term goal. Our long-term goal remains for oil & gas to be self-funding, and as it builds assets along the run with success it\u2019s going to be generating substantial cash flows. Michael Gambardella : And could you talk a little bit, just staying on the oil & gas side, how you could turn the growth back on for oil & gas because you\u2019ve cut it pretty dramatically here? Jim Flores : Well, the outside funding as I said - that turns the growth back on. We share some of that growth so it\u2019ll be muted, but say it\u2019ll be 75% of the growth that we had before once we\u2019re able to secure these financings and show some visibility there. So by year end we could have a couple of these things done and be turning growth back on, but it wouldn\u2019t be as high as it was before because obviously we\u2019re sharing some of that growth with our investors that are putting up the money. Michael Gambardella : Right, okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Tony Rizzuto : Thanks very much and yeah, it is good to see the response to these deteriorating market conditions. And just a follow-up to Mike\u2019s, thinking about on the mining side are there other mining assets that you deem to be non-core in nature? Richard Adkerson : Well Tony, when you look at our mining assets the bulk of those assets are existing producing mines that have significant undeveloped resources that we believe are going to be much more valuable in the future. The reason for selling Candelaria was it was not one of those mines - it was very good operation, good production, fully developed, but it did not have the significant undeveloped resources that we have at El Abra, Peru, Tenke and Cero Verde or in our US assets. So in that sense those assets, the bulk of our assets would be viewed as core and important for our business. We do have some older mines in New Mexico; we\u2019re mining some at Miami, we\u2019re completing that. But those are really operations that we are mining to manage our reclamation obligations and so forth. Now we do have in the plans for dealing with our situation in Indonesia plans to divest interest in PTFI over time. We\u2019ve indicated to the government that we would increase the Indonesian ownership in Indonesia to 30.00% - it\u2019s currently 9.36%. Exactly how that will proceed is dependent on our progress with this MOU. The first step is to offer it to the government; we\u2019ve talked about the possibility of listing on the Indonesian exchange but that is one area of divestment. Interest in our mining assets is strong. We would have the option of selling interest in those assets if that\u2019s what we decided we want to do, but they are core to our future. Tony Rizzuto : Okay. And just a follow- up here : how important is maintenance of the dividend at the current level? You talked about the bridge year 2015 in some previous conversations, and you obviously have some flexibility around that but just can you give us a little bit more color on how you view the maintenance of the current level of the dividend? Richard Adkerson : Well Tony, this is a Board decision, and as I said we\u2019re going to be working very closely with our Board on a real time basis as we go forward. We have developed a plan now that includes the preservation of the dividend. There\u2019s uncertainties about the future of commodity prices and there\u2019s different views about whether prices are going to rebound in the near term, the medium term or you know, there\u2019s talk about oil prices staying low or weakening.  So all of those things are things we\u2019re going to have to work with our Board and keeping our finger on top of it, and that is going to be a decision that the Board would make. And all I can say is right now we\u2019ve developed a plan that preserves the dividend in this plan, and our expectation is the Board\u2019s going to take steps to preserve our liquidity as we go forward. We all want to keep the dividend and we\u2019re going to work hard to try to do it. Tony Rizzuto : Okay, Richard. And just a follow-up on a question for Jim. Jim, it sounds like the plans at least for the first tranche, the first funding might be pretty advanced at this stage. Is that a fair assessment? Jim Flores : Tony, the success we\u2019ve had in the past we\u2019ve got great partners, we have a lot of interest. And mainly because you think about what oil properties out there in this vast array, just take North America, that actually have economics at these levels. They\u2019re not the shales. And they\u2019ve had so much capital going. There\u2019s a tremendous amount of private equity capital that\u2019s unused out there. I think [inaudible] was telling me as much as $100 billion of unused capital and fresh capital that\u2019s just been raised.  There\u2019s a lot of mezzanine capital and a lot of counter-cyclical investors that want to do just like we did at Lucius, is buy oil when it\u2019s $50. So the meeting schedule is robust and we\u2019re not ruling out international players, [inaudible] for those types of things but having done this and having the makeup of our properties where we 100% control, operate - they\u2019re actually producing now. Taking away a lot of the operating risk and timing risk with these larger projects is key to attract the financing. So we\u2019re just going to be arguing about how much we give up as a company and how much the investors need to get their returns, and that\u2019s a good, healthy argument for a good transaction I think. So we are hitting the ground running, and just think about this as a multiple way of financing - and irrespective of where oil prices are it still gives us the best rate of return as a company, of identifying these assets and then financing the development with third parties to drive higher returns for FCX. So we had these thought processes in mind and they sure come in handy when prices do what they just did. Tony Rizzuto : Alright, very helpful. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of [Sal Virani] with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. [Sal Virani]: Thank you. Richard, can you give us an idea of your write down between the gas and oil assets or MMR and PXP? How was it distributed? Richard Adkerson : We follow full cost accounting, Sal, and under full cost accounting the original acquisition cost of both PXP and McMoRan went into a full cost pool. And then as we go forward all costs of exploration and development of oil & gas reserves go into that single pool. So all the costs are kind of like a MixMaster - they just get all blended together and then they\u2019re subject to a ceiling test that\u2019s prescribed by the SEC that puts a limit on how much of those costs can be capitalized. And so in our write down there\u2019s two aspects to it. First of all, the cost in excess of this SEC ceiling amount has been written off, and then in addition there was goodwill assigned to the oil & gas assets and all of that goodwill has been written off. So it\u2019s not possible to distinguish it between McMoRan and PXP, and this of course is a function of pricing. Under the SEC rules, they currently require that the prices use for these full-cost ceiling tests be a trailing twelve-month average.  And so in our ceiling test those costs, the oil price that was used was roughly $90 - it\u2019s $95 actually Kathleen\u2019s telling me. And that\u2019s because that\u2019s a twelve-month average. And as we roll into 2015 as we talk about in the press release and if prices stay low that average is going to come down, and that would be indicative of further full cost write offs going into 2015. All the goodwill is gone so it\u2019s just a question of the ceiling test. [Sal Virani]: Okay. And also the cost decline on the units, the gross cash costs you have from \u201914 to \u201915 - I\u2019m talking about the site production delivery costs, $1.90 to $1.81. Is that all coming from the lower fuel or is there anything else in there also? Richard Adkerson : No, lower fuel is a factor but of course lower energy costs rolls into all other costs - you know, logistics and things like that from suppliers. But with commodity prices dropping, some of our costs are related to steel, for example, the steel balls that we use in our grinding processing facilities, you know, component parts for maintenance, truck tires. Across the board this change in the commodity price environment is affecting costs, and one of the things we\u2019re doing is trying to make sure we take full advantage of that. Kathleen Quirk : Sal, further to that we do forecast here the significant benefit from lower diesel prices. Offsetting some of that is we do have higher consumption as we\u2019re mining higher rates, productivity improving in Indonesia; we\u2019re mining higher rates at Cerro Verde. So we do have some consumption offsets; and then offsetting that we do have some improved volumes. So you net all that together and you see the decline from $1.90 to $1.81. As Richard talked about we believe there will be some additional benefits from other commodity index-types of costs which we\u2019ve reflected some of that in this plan. But we expect to see, if commodity prices stay low we expect to see additional savings as we go throughout the year. [Sal Virani]: And lastly, Kathleen, can you give us an idea of your appetite for increased debt and how the rating agencies would look at it you think? Richard Adkerson : For increased debt? [Sal Virani]: If you need to. If the commodity prices remain low and you need to borrow some money to care for the shortfall, what is your appetite for that? Richard Adkerson : Well, our plan is to manage our business so that we don\u2019t increase debt. I mean we\u2019re going to take steps as we can to improve the maturity schedule of our debt. There will be times because of the nature of our business that we\u2019ll have some draws under our bank credit facility, so you know, that\u2019s what our credit facility is for is to give us bridges to deal with short term issues - whether they come up from business risk or so forth.  But in terms of thinking about substantially increasing our debt level over time, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re focused on. We still, as I started out saying we have plans of reducing our debt level - we\u2019re just not going to be able to do it within the timeframe that we had originally targeted. Kathleen Quirk : And 2015, Sal, is that bridging year in terms of getting to the point where we see free cash flows, substantial free cash flows coming out of the mining business, and then we\u2019ve got these initiatives underway to offset some of the CAPEX in the oil & gas business. So you might see some increase in \u201915 but that is not our plan. Our plan over time is to take leverage down. Richard Adkerson : And you\u2019ve all seen that the credit rating agencies are focused, as you would expect them to be, on lower commodity prices. And we\u2019re working with them and we\u2019re working with a plan to do everything we can to preserve our credit ratings. [Sal Virani]: Great, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano of BMO. Please go ahead. David Gagliano : Hi. I just have a few quick clarification questions really. First of all, does the oil & gas production targets, do those include an assumption of project financing? Jim Flores : No they do not. That will be added once we get the financing secured. Kathleen Quirk : The CAPEX and the production are both aggregate with no partner. Jim Flores : With no partner at this point, so that\u2019s a baseline and you can build from there as we announce things. David Gagliano : Okay, great. And then the operating cash flow numbers, are those before or after a minority interest payment? Kathleen Quirk : Those are before. The minority interest payments will come out of financing. David Gagliano : Okay, great. Okay, fair enough. And then the last question : does the CAPEX reflect any expectations for expenditures potentially for a smelter in Indonesia? Richard Adkerson : No, they\u2019re currently not in there. Our plans would be to develop as we did with the smelter that we developed in the mid-1990\u2019s, to do a structured financing for that project which would be based on contracts with TCs and RCs. And it would be a PTFI-type contract for processing fees that would provide the basis for financing. And then the amount of equity that would be required depends on the participation of the partners that we\u2019ve put together with it. But it is not in there at this point. David Gagliano : Okay, great. Alright, that\u2019s all I had. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Yu with Citi. Please go ahead. Brian Yu : Great, thanks. Good morning. I have a couple questions on oil & gas. You\u2019ve taken the CAPEX expense down to about $2.3 billion annually and then at the same time the production outlook\u2019s been dropped to about 56 million, 57 million barrels. The math on that implies $41 per BOE of CAPEX. Is this a reasonable measure of sustaining CAPEX for the business, $41 BOE? Jim Flores : No, because you\u2019ve got different complexions of what\u2019s being spent and what isn\u2019t because a lot of the wells that are being drilled are being hooked up timely. So you\u2019re getting a muted production number. I would use closer to $30 is probably a reasonable run rate under our non-stressed scenario, and Brian, that\u2019s basically what happens when we bring in third party financing - we drop that number from $30 to $20 and get our costs in line with a $50, $60 oil environment. So that highlights the goal of what we\u2019re trying to do with the financing, but $30 is more representative of a real market. Brian Yu : Okay, so if you\u2019re spending at the $40 rate then does that imply maybe at this rate in \u201918 and \u201919 we should see a growth in production out of the oil & gas? Jim Flores : If we didn\u2019t do any joint ventures that\u2019s correct - you\u2019d be growing at a $20 rate because you\u2019d just be completing wells and putting them on instead of drilling any because you\u2019ve drilled them in the first couple years. But our plan is to do the outside financing and take it from a $40 barrel rate, your number, down to $20 and grow the business with our partners say 75/25. Brian Yu : Okay. And second was just on the outside financing. If I looked at what happened with Lucius, you sold 20% interest in the project but then the convertible preferreds were backed by the parent company. And if we take that same analogy in a way doesn\u2019t that involve the mining assets again? Or is the plan to just limit any kind of outside financing purely to the energy assets and not involve FCX, the parent company and the mining side? Jim Flores : Brian, I\u2019m not sure that was guaranteed by the parent company. I think you\u2019re reading through something there. Kathleen Quirk : It\u2019s at the subsidiary level, Brian, so there\u2019s not a guarantee. Brian Yu : Okay. Yeah, I thought the party that purchased it, they had some warrants to purchase PXP common stock. Jim Flores : The warrants were for the subsidiary. Brian Yu : Okay, got it. Jim Flores : That\u2019s why I said it\u2019s 20% face but when you look at the full percentage of the subsidiary they got 25%. If I blended that I\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s all at the subsidiary level, so about 25%. Brian Yu : Got it, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Oscar Cabrera : Thank you, Operator. Good morning everyone. I just want to get back to the question on the dividend. Is there in your lines of credit or debt any covenants that would limit you from paying the dividend if commodity prices stay low and we\u2019re at the low end of your expectations in operating cash flow? Kathleen Quirk : Oscar, this is Kathleen. There\u2019s not a specific covenant on the dividend. We have maintenance covenants, financial covenants to maintain and that\u2019s all going into our plan. Richard mentioned we are having some discussions about flexibility with the covenants as we bridge through \u201915. But there\u2019s not a specific covenant on the dividend. Oscar Cabrera : Okay, great. And then the other thing is just getting back into this oil & gas CAPEX - so $1.7 billion in cutbacks or cut cap in 2016. Jim, can you just clarify : you\u2019re expecting to get economics of sharing 25% of I\u2019m assuming cash flow on these wells but you\u2019re expecting to get 50% of the CAPEX. Can you just go over that again please? Jim Flores : Let me tell you how it works because I couldn\u2019t follow your math, Oscar. Basically the financing, we have $900 million of CAPEX ahead of us at our Holstein Deep and Heidelberg. We\u2019re asking investors to put up 100%, put up $900 million and for that they\u2019d get X amount of return on the capital they put up plus a residual interest, probably in the form of an override. And that would generate above market returns for their capital - somewhere on the low end 10% to 12%, on the high end 16% to 20% depending on what oil prices do.  And there\u2019s a lot of capital out there that have contacted us who want to do those types of things. We\u2019ll use that capital, and it\u2019s selling a piece of the growth - it\u2019s not selling our existing assets, our existing cash flow, those types of things, but it\u2019s helping us accelerate the growth. Instead of just postponing spending and production performance we\u2019re actually going to be able to in effect accelerate it with the third party capital. That will all be at the subsidiary level, and with the current structured form of equity at that level. So there won\u2019t be any debt to consolidate or anything to FCX, and it\u2019s a great win-win for both parties. And they get the upside of the oil on the piece they get and we get the upside of the production on oil. And one thing in the oil & gas business, we\u2019ve also affected our operating costs because if you\u2019re not growing production your operating costs are going to stay high or increase. One thing about doing the joint venture, we\u2019re able to have more production go through the same facilities and you\u2019ll see our operating, our LOE costs go down, too. So the purpose of lowering the CAPEX costs through the joint ventures and also increasing the production and accelerating the development will also lower our operating costs. So we\u2019ll end up getting our operating costs down below $20 from where they are, or in the low-$20s from where they are in the high-$20s now; and then we also have our fixed G&A costs and so forth and then you have our capital costs.  So we\u2019ve got our capital costs around, in the $20s; we\u2019ve got our operating costs in the $20s. We\u2019re in a $40, $45 cost environment or expanse environment in 2016 - that\u2019s our goal on the oil & gas side. And we can live and prosper in a $60 world. It\u2019s not as fun as $100 but it\u2019s still\u2026 We\u2019ve got to right size our costs and this is the most aggressive and best way to do it. Kathleen Quirk : And Oscar, one of the things you can think of in terms of this funding is we did it on the mining side several years ago with the expansion at Grasberg where someone came in and funded the development. We added volumes and shared those volumes. So it\u2019s not exactly but it\u2019s just another analog that you can think about. Jim Flores : Yeah, a lot of different structures, a lot of deals. But the key about having this is having quality projects with good economics where you can do it. That\u2019s the big difference. Oscar Cabrera : Fair enough - Grasberg 60/40 with [Real Pinto]. But what would be the attributable production then and the required CAPEX? You were looking at 80 million barrels so are we looking at 70 million now and an additional $1 billion in expenditures? What\u2019s in mind? Jim Flores : I\u2019ll tell you what, Oscar - sign a CA and I\u2019ll send you a teaser and show you exactly what it is. [laughter] We\u2019re looking for investors. Seriously there\u2019s a three-well development, a five-well development and a ten-well development depending on success but it\u2019s somewhere between, call it net to FCX between 30 million and 70 million barrels depending on the success. I\u2019m sorry - 30,000 to 70,000 barrels a day, not million barrels. 30,000 to 70,000 barrels a day of incremental production over the next three to four years. So they\u2019re big, significant projects and that\u2019s why we want to preserve them and develop them with outside capital for the benefit of FCX shareholders. Oscar Cabrera : Right, thank you sir. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead. John Tumazos : Thank you. The debt target had been $12 billion net looking forward a couple years. Has that target changed? Should it be lower because you\u2019ve divested some assets, impaired some assets, JV\u2019d some assets and prices changed? Where do you think that target\u2019s going to be for 2016-2018? Richard Adkerson : Well John, I started out by saying that the change in copper and gold prices has really resulted in us having to shift a focus from reaching any sort of debt target, certainly in the 2016 timeframe, to adjusting our business to be responsive to much lower copper and oil prices. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing now. As we go through this process we\u2019ll have a longer term goal of debt reduction and adjusting our balance sheet but we\u2019re going to have to see how the world evolves to say how we\u2019re going to respond to it. And it would just be impossible right now to set any sort of debt targets within timeframes. We\u2019ll be talking with all of you on a quarter-by-quarter basis and reporting to you how we\u2019re responding to it. We\u2019re not backing away from our debt reduction objectives and having a very strong balance sheet is what we\u2019re going to do - it\u2019s just the realities are we have to deal with the world that\u2019s put before us and that\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to approach it. John Tumazos : Thank you. It\u2019s tough times and we appreciate all your efforts. Richard Adkerson : Well, I appreciate that, John. As you know better than anybody we\u2019ve been through these several times before and we were always aware that that\u2019s a possibility, and we\u2019ve been preparing ourselves for it and now it\u2019s our job to execute. John Tumazos : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Littlewood with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Nathan Littlewood : Good morning, guys, thanks for the opportunity. I had a few more questions on oil & gas as well. The first was just about the production and decline rates. You\u2019ve given some really useful guidance of what\u2019s required in this business to maintain outputs at that sort of mid-$50s sort of level. But under a [bare] scenario can you talk a little bit about what the un-remediated decline rates look like for each of these oil & gas assets? Jim Flores : Well, just looking at an average, think about somewhere around 12%, 13% in our business. And remember with the timing of oil & gas coming on, spending, like we have some spending in our Vito project in our budget that doesn\u2019t come on until 2020. It\u2019s not a direct correlation to decline rates, the capital being spent. There\u2019s some different variations. But if you think about a 12% decline rate in the business that\u2019ll get you to kind of where you need to be on a maintenance capital which will be lower than what you\u2019re seeing in our CAPEX. Nathan Littlewood : Okay, and would the Gulf of Mexico number be a bit higher than that perhaps? Jim Flores : Yeah, use 13% to 14% there and use 4% to 5% in California and that\u2019ll get you kind of there. Nathan Littlewood : Gotcha, okay. And just on this whole funding side of things, obviously at current oil prices the underlying assumption here is that the oil & gas business is willing to lever up, to spend the capital that you\u2019ve got planned here. What I\u2019m a little unclear on though is just how much further you\u2019re willing to leverage this business up - I mean how much further the debt, how much more debt is appropriate here for this business to take on before a more drastic change to the production outlook might be required? Jim Flores : When you\u2019re saying \u201clever up,\u201d Nathan, what are you talking about? Are you talking about CAPEX spend or are you talking about actually balance sheet debt? Nathan Littlewood : Well the balance sheet debt. There\u2019s no way that this business can generate anywhere near $2.3 billion in cash flow on $50 oil. So\u2026 Kathleen Quirk : Right. What we\u2019re working to do is to obtain third party funding for some of these capital expenditures - not in the form of debt but in the form of an equity participation by these investors in these projects. So it\u2019s not levering up, it\u2019s sharing the CAPEX with third parties and sharing the economics of the development activities. Jim Flores : And trying to drive a net neutral goal. As I was trying to be clear it\u2019s going to be difficult to do that in \u201915 but we think we\u2019ll be able to achieve it in \u201916, just timing and capital inflows. So I guess the global answer to your question, Nathan, is that we don\u2019t have much appetite all to leverage up. We\u2019re going to do whatever we can to not do that. Nathan Littlewood : Okay. Richard Adkerson : I think this is an important point to make because we\u2019re talking about joint venture participation - not debt obligations of the consolidated group. We\u2019re obviously giving up some of the equity in these assets at the asset level, but in return because these projects have been put together value has already been created in them, you have people willing - and this kind of gets back to Oscar\u2019s question - to pay more than their proportionate share of the forward costs because they\u2019re compensating our company for all the good work that we\u2019ve done in identifying the assets, developing them to date, presenting the opportunity. Nathan Littlewood : Okay. So these equity and JV opportunities, this is sort of independent of the $900 million Holstein and Heidelberg that was mentioned earlier. Is that correct? Jim Flores : No, that is how we generate the $900 million. That\u2019s $900 million of CAPEX going forward in the Holstein and Heidelberg projects. We\u2019re going to get the development JV to fund that $900 million which will reduce the $2.3 billion. Nathan Littlewood : Okay. So you go from $2.3 billion to $1.4 billion. I guess what I\u2019m getting at is at $50 oil there isn\u2019t $1.4 billion of cash flow coming out of that business. Jim Flores : Then we\u2019re going to do the next one at Marlin and King and keep going. I was trying to make the point I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s all going to line up in the same year, and Richard talked about we\u2019re looking at a two-year type of scenario to make sure that we get to a net neutral position and we [inaudible] what we take. Then on top of that these projects drive such good economics for Freeport, at any oil price they\u2019re good business based on finding discoveries, delineating them and getting somebody to help develop them with us so we can drive higher returns for the shareholders.  So it\u2019s kind of a continuation of the plan we were discussing. It takes on greater importance now as you highlight because the cash flows are not there to fund our projects right now, and so but it still drives better economics - even in a higher oil price environment. Kathleen Quirk : And keep in mind for 2015 as you\u2019re thinking about the numbers, we do have the puts in place that really give us a higher realization than $50 for 2015. So we\u2019ve got that $20 of price protection; we\u2019ve got to pay the put premiums of just under $7 a barrel. So our cash flows from oil & gas in 2015 will be higher than what you would expect in the $50 market. Nathan Littlewood : Absolutely, that\u2019s all very helpful. Thank you. So just one final question, and I guess a higher level one here : your approach or attitude towards diversification of the business is a little bit different to other diversified mining companies. I mean if I look at some of your peers they\u2019ve all demonstrated a willingness in the past to sort of subsidize unprofitable businesses with profitable ones for a period - I guess Rio Tinto with its iron ore and aluminum businesses is a pretty obvious and recent example.  It sounds like your approach towards these two businesses is as it was in the beginning, which is they\u2019re still sort of two separate buckets - you\u2019ve got a mining or copper bucket and an oil & gas bucket, and the two are sort of not subsidizing one another. I\u2019m just wondering if that is an approach that\u2019s necessarily set in stone going forward? I guess what I\u2019m thinking about is some of the costs of capital that you\u2019re talking about here for external funding of the oil & gas business seem to me to be significantly higher than the cost of capital that the copper business has got access to at the moment. And the copper business is generating some cash so why would you not use some copper earnings to support oil & gas? Richard Adkerson : Well, it comes back to the company\u2019s overall financial situation. When we announced the acquisition of the oil & gas business, we talked about our entry into that business in two stages. The first stage was going to be one of de-lever - in other words, we incurred significant debt in acquiring the oil & gas assets. At that point we had a clear cut path because of commodity prices and paying that debt off in a reasonable amount of time. And then we said we were going to go forward beyond that point in investing where returns were greatest for our shareholders. And I think that\u2019s still the way that we would see it, is these significant recent declines in commodity prices are requiring us to take steps to protect our balance sheet currently. We want to work hard to protect our credit ratings - I think that\u2019s important for credit investors as well as equity investors and it has other implications to our business. And so that means we\u2019re going to be focused on looking at alternative sources of capital, and these joint ventures in the oil & gas business provide us a near term way of doing that. It\u2019s something our organization has been experienced in, the industry\u2019s experienced in. There\u2019s a huge amount of capital as Jim said available to do those sorts of things. So we are having a primary objective of protecting our balance sheet and our liquidity in the current environment. We don\u2019t believe the current environment\u2019s going to be the long term environment. We don\u2019t have any predictions of when it will turn but we believe it\u2019ll turn and then we\u2019ll be in a position of allocating capital in a different way. Jim Flores : Just from a standpoint of the oil & gas business, it has flexibility to fund itself, fund its projects. But really we\u2019re all about driving higher returns for our shareholders, you know. And if we\u2019re using outside capital on a promoted basis to develop these assets and we can manufacture these assets as we have in the past with great exploration results or exploitation results and we have this huge project in the Gulf of Mexico with tens of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of development opportunities - maybe at some point in time it makes sense. But right now it\u2019s much better to accelerate the PV of that and the reserve life of our Gulf of Mexico business and we need to use outside funding to do it. And we drive higher returns for the FCX shareholders. So it\u2019s a pretty get away from the cost of capital aspect. I mean if copper\u2019s generating $5 billion of excess cash flow a year and so forth then you\u2019d be having to measure oil & gas returns against other shareholder initiatives and so forth. But right now the best initiative for us is to run our business balance like Richard talked about and make sure that we take advantage of the market and the project financing; and accelerate our oil & gas business for the benefit of all the FCX shareholders. Nathan Littlewood : Okay, thanks very much guys. I appreciate your time. Richard Adkerson : And Nathan, I\u2019ll just say one thing that 2008 has taught us and one thing this current environment\u2019s taught us, if you\u2019re in these commodity businesses diversification within commodities is not going to pull you out when these broader scale things happen to you. So we are focused on what are the best assets, what are the best returns for our shareholders; how do we manage our balance sheet to allow us to take advantage of this great asset base. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. Nathan Littlewood : Absolutely. Jim Bob Moffett : This is Jim Bob. I want to make a couple general comments. Earlier someone mentioned the Rio Tinto financing [inaudible]. The reason the financing was so optimistic for us was that there was no production that was taken from the existing reserves. Rio Tinto only participated 60/40 in the new reserve. With [inaudible], and if you look at Slide 38 with the platforms we have in the deepwater we acquired from BP - BP spent years trying to put those platforms in the right place, that\u2019s why there\u2019s so much oil & gas there.  What\u2019s easy to understand is the existing wells that we have and existing reserves wouldn\u2019t be earned by the investor that comes in. It\u2019ll only be participation in the additional wells we drill, so that\u2019s exactly like the Grasberg deal that we structured. The reason why the Grasberg deal could be sold on such a promoted basis is because of the great asset that was found out there. For the same reason what you\u2019re seeing with these big [platforms] is they\u2019re [inaudible] throughout the deepwater trench, and I want to emphasize again that all the studies and geological work that went into putting those platforms in the right place. They just didn\u2019t throw darts at the wall. Secondly we\u2019ve finally got a discovery that we\u2019ve been looking for on [inaudible]. It was a well that was tested in the Tuscaloosa is the second largest well that we\u2019ve ever tested onshore. That rock, which is [100 million a day rate] may be the biggest well for that. But through the deep [sub-soft] structure we finally found a formation that had the right return to give us the entire flow rate. And we control that whole [play] onshore. Dozens of prospects have the same Tuscaloosa formation as their primary target. [Inaudible] is the Tuscaloosa trench to the north and Mobile Bay over to the east, which is a major asset if you get a chance to look at it.  So we control some huge amounts of reserves that\u2019ll be drilled in the future. So this is not an ordinary portfolio, just like Grasberg wasn\u2019t ordinary. When I first started working on the financing at Grasberg a lot of people in the mining business said \u201cYou can\u2019t promote a mining asset the way you do oil & gas, Jim Bob.\u201d Well, if you\u2019ve got the right asset you can. We have the right assets and we\u2019ve just got to give them a little time to do what\u2019s necessary - finance them and add the maximum value. Nathan Littlewood : Thanks again, I appreciate all the color. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Bristo with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Steve Bristo : Yeah, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to come back to this $900 million in project financing. You mentioned that if you do that $900 million that\u2019s turning the growth back on. So if you do actually get the $900 million how much does that actually impact the $2.3 billion you\u2019re currently forecasting that doesn\u2019t really have the growth built into it? Jim Flores : Yeah, you bring up a good point, Steve. It adds a couple hundred million of growth capital back into the $2.3 billion, so it\u2019s probably a net $600 million or $700 million of net reduction in CAPEX because we add $200 million or $300 million back of growth spending that we have to do to execute on that plan. Steve Bristo : Can you just walk me through again how you went from that $40 per BOE down to $20 for your share of capital spending? Jim Flores : Well, it\u2019s directionally from the standpoint you have to add additional joint ventures - you can\u2019t just do it with $900 million. You\u2019ve got to continue to do the Marlin King joint venture and then the subsequent joint ventures after that - all in development as we go forward. So basically you take a half to 60% of our CAPEX spending and do it in third-party development, third-party joint ventures for development and you can get to that number. But it\u2019s going to take some more inputs that I\u2019ll have to go through with you at a later date - I can\u2019t go through them all right now. Steve Bristo : Oh, so the $20 was a target then, okay. Jim Flores : Yeah, it\u2019s a target because if we get our costs down to $25 and our CAPEX costs, our CAPEX investments down to $20 that\u2019s $45 out of a $50 environment. That\u2019s what it is. So you kind of back into the target and then you have to do what you have to do to get there. Steve Bristo : And would the $900 million be fully just in 2015 or is there any of that that really impacts 2016? Jim Flores : That\u2019s in 2015, so it\u2019ll be a net $600 million, $700 million in 2015. Think about it that way. Steve Bristo : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sussman with Clarkson. Please go ahead. Jeremy Sussman : Yeah, hello, good morning. Obviously there\u2019s been a lot of discussions about JVs and farming out some of the oil & gas reserves. Can you give us a sense, I think you talked about sort of over a two-year timeframe but it sounds like you\u2019ve had some discussions. I guess when can we maybe expect an update from you guys in terms of obviously the ability to update our numbers in terms of production, etc.? Jim Flores : Sometime this summer. We\u2019ll be updating as we go. Richard Adkerson : And we\u2019ll give you a status report at our next quarterly call. We\u2019re coming up on the time of year of metals and mining conferences, so as always we\u2019re going to be transparent and give our investors the current status of things. Jeremy Sussman : Okay, great. But it sounds like we should have some clarity by the summer on some of this. Jim Flores : Well, you hope to. It all depends a lot on commodity prices. If commodity prices stay low than you\u2019ll probably have it sooner rather than later because investors will be a little more hungry. Where it\u2019s diverted is they get a little less hungry as oil prices recover, so\u2026 Richard Adkerson : And as Jim talked about this is not like it\u2019s going to be one fell swoop deal. I mean we\u2019re going to make steps; it\u2019s going to be an ongoing process. So it\u2019s just these things happen very quickly as I keep saying over and over, and we\u2019re responding to it and we\u2019ve started this process of talking to potential third-party investors. And we\u2019re going to advance that as quickly as we\u2019re able to. Jim Flores : And Jeremy, the big deal is it\u2019s maximizing the returns to the FCX stakeholders. That\u2019s the key objective here. And sure, it offsets CAPEX in a low-price environment and everything else, so\u2026 Jim Bob Moffett : This is Jim Bob. I want to be sure to remind everybody that these joint ventures we\u2019re talking about on the platforms that we have, the existing platforms, they will not participate in current production, current reserves. All the additional reserves, the new reserves that were found by the subsequent wells - identically to what we referred to with the Grasberg financing. None of the initial production was included in the Rio Tinto bid; it all would depend upon speculation for finding new reserves that they participate 60/40 in - importing at 60.  So remember, we\u2019ve got a lot of investments we\u2019ve put in these major hubs out there. Nobody else has these hubs and for that reason any production that\u2019s found near the hub, they\u2019ve been drilling around on a [inaudible] basis. And we will bring production to you. All these platforms are under capacity, so you have the ability to sell a development well off a promoted basin. And we also have the advent of people drilling discoveries out there that they know they can\u2019t build. They put their own freestanding platform and they\u2019ll be bringing the reserves to you. Jim Flores : Right, and that\u2019s articulated on Page 41 of the slide presentation where it talks about our reserves and excludes Highlander and Holstein Deep. And the Holstein Deep reserves and growth are what we\u2019re talking about doing in the joint venture. That\u2019ll give you a representation when we talk about net amounts that aren\u2019t in the joint ventures. Jeremy Sussman : That\u2019s great, thank you. Thank you very much for all the color. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Garrett Nelson with BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Garrett Nelson : Hi, good morning. Could you remind us what the annual maintenance CAPEX is for the mining business? On the CAPEX guidance slide, is that $1.2 billion number for other mining CAPEX in 2015 a good number to use, or perhaps that $1.2 billion is not entirely maintenance CAPEX? Kathleen Quirk : That\u2019s a good number to use. It\u2019s in the range of $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion but the $1.2 billion that we\u2019ve got in \u201915 is a good kind of run rate to use. We\u2019ve taken steps to defer things when we can but on an ongoing basis it\u2019s in that range. Garrett Nelson : Okay. And then again on that slide the $2.5 billion of major CAPEX on the mining side for 2015, you footnote that that primarily includes Cerro Verde and Grasberg underground development. Cerro Verde will obviously drop off after this year, but if you would how much CAPEX specifically is budgeted here both for Grasberg underground development and for Cerro Verde in each year 2015, 2016, 2017? Kathleen Quirk : The Cerro Verde CAPEX is split between \u201915 and \u201916. We had $3.1 billion incurred through \u201914 and most of that difference will be spent in 2015 with some trailing into 2016. We also have the Grasberg underground which as Richard said will average $700 million a year and that\u2019s to our interest. We do have a couple years where it is higher than the $700 million average and some that are lower than the $700 million average, but that\u2019s about what we\u2019re spending on average for the Grasberg underground. We\u2019ve also got some other projects in 2016. We\u2019ve got, in 2017 we\u2019re expanding the Miami smelter and then as you get into \u201917 we start the development of the extension of the Safford mine. So we\u2019ve got some CAPEX in 2017 for the Safford extension as well as the Miami smelter. But the bulk of the Cerro Verde spending is completed in \u201915. Richard Adkerson : By far the bulk - I think it\u2019s roughly $500 million left in 2016. But I do want to point out that this is a project that\u2019s scheduled to finish right at the end of the year, so it\u2019s a big construction project. As I said we\u2019ve got 12,000 to 14,000 people there and we\u2019ll update you as we go through the year. There\u2019s a possibility that some of these costs may go over into the next year, but right now things are looking very good. Garrett Nelson : Okay, thanks a lot, Richard and Kathleen. Operator : I will now turn the call over to management for any closing remarks. Richard Adkerson : Well, we\u2019ve given you a lot of information today. Someone mentioned it\u2019s a complicated world - indeed it is. We\u2019re going to respond to it as we have historically in a prudent and thoughtful way and we appreciate all of your interest in the company. We\u2019re available to respond to follow-up questions that you may have, and just let David know and we\u2019ll answer your questions as we go forward. Good luck in the Northeast and we look forward to talking with you again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today\u2019s call are available on our Website at www.fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the internet, anyone may listen to the [Audio Gap] materially. We\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. On the call today are Jim Bob Moffett, our Chairman of the Board; Richard Adkerson, Vice-Chairman and President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Flores, Vice-Chairman and Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas President and Chief Executive Officer with several other senior members of our team in the room today. I\u2019ll start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then will turn the call over to Richard who will begin reviewing our recent performance and outlook in the slide presentation. After our formal remarks, we\u2019ll turn the call over to questions. Today FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of 2.5 billion or $2.38 per share for the first quarter of 2015. The loss attributable to common stock included net charges of 2.4 billion or $2.32 per share in the first quarter primarily for the reduction of the carrying value of oil and gas properties pursuant to SEC for cost accounting rules and a related tax charge to establish a deferred tax valuation allowance. Our adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled 60 million or $0.06 per share during the quarter.  Our copper sales during the quarter totaled \u20a4960 million that was above the first quarter of last year of \u20a4871 million. Gold sales totaled 263,000 ounces that was also above the last year first quarter of 187,000 ounces and oil and gas sales totaled 12.5 barrels of oil equivalents in the first quarter. Our realized copper price of $2.72 per pound in the first quarter was below the year ago quarter of $3.14 per pound. Gold prices of 1186 per ounce were below the year ago quarter of roughly $1300 per ounce. FMO&Gs average realized price for crude oil was $56.51 per barrel in the quarter and that included about $12 per barrel of realized cash gains on derivative contracts. Operating cash flows during the quarter totaled 717 million, capital expenditures as we advance our projects totaled 1.9 billion in the quarter. We ended the quarter with total debt of 20.3 billion and consolidated cash of 549 million. As previously reported, we completed amendments to our bank loans during the quarter to provide more flexible financial covenants and to extend maturities under our term loan. At the end of the quarter availability under the revolver approximated 3 billion of undrawn availability and undrawn availability under the Cerro Verde credit facility approximated $1 billion. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Richard who\u2019ll be referring to the slide materials on our Web site. Richard Adkerson : Good morning everyone. Before we turn to the slides, I want to look back on our January call when we discussed this year 2015 as being a bridging year as we complete our major copper expansion projects that we started in 2010 and transition to 2016 when we will realize the ongoing benefits of these investments. These projects will generate volumes that will be accompanied by lower cost, lower capital expenditures. All of this adds up to a significant free cash flow generation which will not be dependent on higher copper prices. Now we remain very optimistic about the outlook for the copper markets. We supported by the world\u2019s need for copper and the challenges in developing supplies and maintaining supplies for copper, but we are cognizant of the near term uncertainties and commodity prices so we\u2019re going to continue to be diligence about controlling cost and will remain flexible to respond to market conditions. We\u2019ve already taken a series of actions to respond to these market conditions and to maintain our financial strength as we work through 2015 to future years when our financial metrics are expected to improve dramatically. We\u2019ve made significant progress in our near-in completion of our Brownfield copper development projects. These are among the most attractive in the world. As we complete these projects, we\u2019re positioned to achieve our deleveraging objectives over time, increase cash returns to shareholders and provide exposure to our shareholders to a streak winning commodity markets in the future. Jim\u2019s going to be talking with you about several important milestones completed in our oil and gas business since our acquisitions by FCX in 2013. The combination of our large scale infrastructure in the Gulf with significant available capacity to expand and our strategic lease position and exploration and development inventory together with the experience of our team in our Gulf of Mexico focus area positions us to grow our business, generate attractive investment returns and increase asset values. When we completed the oil and gas acquisitions we established an objective for the business to be self-funding. Today that has been accomplished through cash flows and asset sale. We are now evaluating a range of alternatives to provide supplemental external funding for our oil and gas investments and we will continue to do so.  We are going to talk today that among these alternatives we are considering a public listing of minority interest in Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas. Publicly trated Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas would -- values of our oil and gas assets through a public market evaluation and enable us to expand the financing alternatives for our oil and gas operations on a standalone basis. Subject to market conditions this alternative essentially would be completed in late 2015 following the completion of an SEC review of the required registration statement  The following review of our business and its outlook will evidence that we have a strong portfolio of assets with attractive near-term and longer term organic growth options, a dedicated and highly motivated management team and organization to execute these plans and a roadmap for managing our assets and finances as we deliver on our strategy of providing long term values for our shareholders. Turning to Slides, on slide 3, we have a picture of our new annual report for 2014. This report titled Value at our core, talks about the substantial value and our assets, the growing production and cash flow profile, our exposure, to markets with favorable fundamental. It's our financial strength, the way we manage our business in a responsible manner, environment community and social aspects, and an experienced management team that we have In the first quarter, just turning to slide 4, the highlights are, we substantially ramped up our Morenci expansion. We had record quarterly sales at our Tenke Fungurume projects following the completion of our phase II expansion in 2013. The Cerro Verde construction project is on track to become the world's largest copper concentrator facility. We are entering into the phases of the higher ore-grades of Grasberg as we approach completion of our mines planned to complete mining in the open pit. And we set the stage for growth as I mentioned in production with declining future capital expenditures. In the oil and gas business we had positive drilling results. And our Holstein deep facility and Parnell in the Vito basin and at the King, project Green Well high end to the modern facility, this significantly expanded our resource base. We established new production as the Lucius project came on-stream. Dorado, Highlander and our on-shore, the gas project, combining these added we are producing at 25 barrels of equivalents a day by the end of the quarter.  And we have an enhanced inventory, a financially attractive development projects and as I mentioned we are advancing plans for external funding for executing this plan to develop these assets. Kathleen reviewed the financial highlights for the quarter in comparison to the first quarter of 2014. Of course we are dealing with lower commodity prices with copper prices being roughly 12% lower and oil prices is half of what they were in the year ago quarter. Other than that our business from the fundamental standpoint operated in an efficient and effective way. Just returned from the annual CESCO Week in Santiago, Chile, that was last week; a lot of commentary there about copper markets. When you step back and look at where we are right now in 2015, the surpluses that had been projected for a number of past years are not developing as they were estimated. Projects have been delayed, production has been interrupted and the market has not moved into a large surplus position. The focus by investors and people involved in the industry has been on China, with China's lower growth rate and uncertainties about its economy, its base has grown significantly. The government is providing economic stimulus and China's need for copper is going to continue to be significant and the key factor in terms of near-term. The U.S. as we evidence, we provide over 40% of the downstream copper for the U.S. markets growing at a moderate rate. Economic stimulus is being applied in Europe and Japan and we're seeing the beginnings of growth in Europe in our business there. The industry continues to face the supply side challenges. We're cognizant and as I mentioned in the near term price uncertainty but we remain very optimistic about the midterm and long term fundamentals of this business. And our company is really positioned to take advantage of that in a very significant way. You can see on slide 7, our operating results for our mining business in the first quarter we continued to be focused on cost management. Our team and leaders of that team are here in the room with me today. They've done a great job in leading our whole organization to focus on cost. We had good cost performance in the quarter. We came in significantly lower than our own internal plans for cost control and our consolidated unit cost guidance with our $0.64 a pound was lower than the guidance we had last quarter and you can see how that operates, how that was reflected in our regional operation. Our growth in production in North America came from Morenci was also good performance as we know and in South America the decline reflects the sale of the Candelaria project, which produced just under a 100 million pounds in first quarter of 2014. Indonesia is a stronger quarter in the first quarter of \u201914 when we're dealing with the export ban and as I mentioned Africa operated well and achieved record production for the quarter. Looking forward through 2015, we have been working to get to the point now that we are approaching for several years to be well positioned and take advantage of what we will achieve to the completion of our expansion project. What we will achieve in Indonesia Grasberg as we enter into the final period of mining from the old pit, you can see growing production volumes during the quarter lowering unit cash cost as we move forward in 2015 and lower capital cost as we go beyond 2015. In the 2016 this has been our long term plan and now we are achieving it. At [indiscernible] we are just terrifically excited about what the progress has been made there. Engineering and major procurements are complete. As I mentioned, when we complete this we'll be processing through our concentrate 360,000 tons a day and that will be the world's largest, the construction is on schedule at this point and 70% complete. We're targeting getting it finished in late 2015 and as I said the entire organization as we review this internally is very excited about what we're doing there. This way at 600 million pounds of copper per annum, $4.6 billion was our original estimate and that's where we are today in terms of looking at it. So, it's good to see that we're progressing on a time schedule we set within the capital budget that we set. In Indonesia, we continue to be engaged in active discussions with the government to amend this is -- the government has expressed -- the government officials have expressed the recognition of our need for certainty in terms of our physical terms and our operating rights and we're working cooperatively with the government in how to accomplish this within the government's regulatory framework. A lot of mutual benefits for us, our company and for the country of Indonesia with the operations and Papua, we had a very long term positive partnership. We're working hard to sustain that in an environment of changes in government and expectations and aspirations in Indonesia but this operation is the economic engine for the development of Papua and that something that we share in common with the government of Indonesia and with our own company. It provides significant benefits to the Indonesian economy. As we stand right now all of our rights under our call continued to be applied until we reach a mutually agreeable approach to amending that and these negotiations are taking place. We do have a memorandum of understanding that was extended earlier this year to July 2015 and as part of that in the memorandum of understanding, we're working with partners to advance plan as far the expansion of our Smelter operations we're focused in the Gresik area of East Java where we have the existing Smelter that was developed in the mid 1990, which is Indonesia's only Smelter. At the operations itself we have now completed the access to our massive underground ore bodies. We expect that DMLZ extension of the existing DOZ mine to start up late this year and we're working to develop the underground reserves that lie below the Grasberg open pit. The Grasberg Block Cave mine, which is scheduled to begin ramping up in 2018. Development capital of over $3 billion has been spent, $2.5 billion net to PT Freeport Indonesia and we expect that PTFI share of these costs will average 600 million a year over the next five years and throughout this period we've been able to successfully continue with this underground development. Beyond our existing producing asset our expansion projects the transition of Grasberg to being a fully underground operation we look to the future, our projects where we're not currently committing capital to at this point but they will provide the opportunity for long term growth for our company. They include a very large sulfide resource at our El Abra mine in Northern Chile, this mine will -- this resource would support a major concentrator development projects, currently our operations at El Abra have been SX-EW operations with significant incremental production that would be achieved with that. At this point, we're studying options for getting water power, dealing with tailings and working with our partners to do this in an effective way. In the United States, we're with the lower energy cost here and the productivity of American workers, we have great opportunities for future expansions at our mines in Arizona.  At Bagdad there is a large sulfide resource that would allow us to more than double mill capacity at significant amounts of copper and we're doing the initial steps to look at that project including the acquisition of water rights which is a key for that and tailings deposition areas. At our Safford mine, which is in Eastern Arizona near Morenci, we have additional oxide resources that would extend the existing productive facility. That\u2019s in an adjoining Ore body called Lone Star, which is near there and has oxides that could expand that, extend our infrastructure beyond the life of the oxides at Safford and then at both Safford and Lone Star there is a significant sulfide resource for the future. At Tenke Fungurume besides the oxide ore we have the opportunity for further expansion to produce incremental volumes from oxide, that\u2019s depending on getting power. But there is a massive high grade mixed ore and sulfide resource that we're conducting exploration, drilling and doing metallurgical studies that would look for, and looking at how we process it over time. With that report on our minor operations then I'm going to turn the presentation over to Vince who talk about oil and gas business. Jim Flores : Thank you, Richard. Good morning everyone. Before we start, we talked about the ore market commentary, you can see the WTI and Brent curves an HLS curves. Here on the graph the market obviously continues to be volatile as it goes to its price in market discovery of where all the wall ore needs to go and at what price. We see it as continue to be volatile, it was down 50% in the beginning of the first quarter, was up 20% at the end of the first quarter. So, as we bear through that as an assets re- price both in accounting but also in the marketplace. We continue to focus our operations and continue to do good things with the drill bit and fall through with our operating plan. We continue to see the ore market cleaning up if you will. The contango curve is always a positive event future oil prices on the Brent side and we continue to see the oil market under strain going forward as demand has really been the big story here in the first quarter as we seen a lot of gasoline demand here in the U.S. and other parts of the world on the finished product side that we think is going to continue increase as these current oil prices take hold of the marketplace. On Page 14, to put together just a chronological series of highlights from 2013 to 2014 obviously for Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas. When it was formed as the combination between PXP and MMR and acquired by Freeport 2013 big adjustment period and the total oil and gas divisions by 174,000 BOE per day. It was a big increase from 2012. Get our hands around all the assets and also the corporate structure of Freeport. It was a big achievement for us in \u201913 and put us on a growth path to say how we\u2019re going to develop all these assets and have the right personnel, right equipment, right operating plan going forward was a key part of it. And when we look at our asset review in 2014, we saw what assets might not fit in the next five years for us building value overtime. They were valuable at the time but they were not going to build value overtime and be meaningful to Freeport and the Eagleford shale someone like category which will end up selling it for $3.1 billion and we were able to rotate that about $1.5 billion of that money into some significant assets well overtime like Heidelberg, Lucius and our Vito project we\u2019ll talk about. Then we continued to acquire leases and seismic to put our projects in the best possible position of bringing forward the exemplary results without failure and been able to use the new seismic and additional acreage to add the resources to our existing infrastructure. For 2015 we started seeing results there through with our first production of Lucius development that was a discovery that we discovered in 2009 with Anadarko and it came one netting us between 20,000 barrels a day to 25,000 barrels a day. We\u2019ve successfully drilled wells at Holstein Deep and also King Marlin areas around our existing infrastructure that have validated our seismic and bought big resources there. We\u2019ll show you the Holstein Deep progression of resources that we\u2019ve identified there with additional drilling. And then also on our Vito area they\u2019ve several joint prospects we drilled the first one that Richard\u2019s talked about Power Nap that was successful, so we\u2019re off to a great start there. And you go through \u2013 on top of that the Highlander discovery that we announced in \u201914, we put in our production here in \u201915 and it\u2019s producing quite well down in the lower St. Martin Parish Louisiana and we look forward to talking about developing that further going forward as gas prices rebound. So all in all we\u2019re on the edge where rose spot in oil and gas business and then with the 145 projects outlined on Page 15 that there are about greater than 20 percentage strip in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico this is all because it\u2019s attached to existing infrastructure or has infrastructure plan that has \u2013 it\u2019s very cost efficient in the Vito area but the Keathley Canyon, Green Canyon, Mississippi Canyon is tying back toexisting infrastructure that we own or we have an interest in.  And the Vito area the reserves are so large that the returns are going to be excellent from the standpoint of size and the facility that we\u2019re going to build with the operator shale and be in a situation to maximize our economics in that area. So with this deep inventory and so forth what we need to focus is manage our cash flow, manage our capital whether inside or outside going forward to make sure that we achieve the copper objectives of FCX. In the first quarter 2015 Freeport-McMoRan highlights on Page 16 we\u2019ve had continued steady production performance from California. We advanced our Gulf of Mexico growth strategy as I described. The Inboard Lower Tertiary besides the Highlander significant flow test and production at Highlander, we\u2019ve had our Farthest Gate West well as a potential discovery we have completion underway that we hope to have that completed this summer and I\u2019ll talk further about that and we had about $100 million in net ore hedging realizations that helped buffer the volatile prices in the first quarter. And our deepwater Gulf of Mexico progress reports specifically area by area Green Canyon, Mississippi Canyon in the Vito area on Page 17 you can see there\u2019s a lot of busy work going on and as we go through this process I want everybody to understand is that our operations plan and our budget or risk and that\u2019s everybody does that but as our operation plan outperform our risk basically we had an incredible two and half quarters of excellent drilling results and so forth it also de-risk some of the capital and that\u2019s somebody upside moving in our capital budget is strictly because who else who have risked it at 80% success for now, 100% success and so forth it may sound small but the numbers are big and so that puts upside pressure due to the success of all these projects [indiscernible] all of that in the last two quarters. And you can go through the detail here. The big key here and everybody focused on the whole thing deep Great Canyon with the gross resources were initially 75 million barrels and now up to 280 million barrels because of the additional drilling and then the cash flow is going to get out of the Dorado King and KOQB area because of our seismic tie and the success we\u2019ve had there is our Vito area, power discovery which is offset discovery to our victory area, very significant discovery for several reasons, number one obviously its large column of bore that is over extensive, a nice reservoir size, on top of that it is really helped us getting confidence and all the additional projects and the next when we have to drill deeply that we going to nearly move to after we finish our present logging operation at Parnell.  And the next page or page 18, you see the overall picture of our assets. We want to focus on hosting deep by like in the Great Canyon Parnell is for us to two highlighted assets that we have. On page 19 the hosting facility, our hosting deep development we\u2019re drilling on the southwest side you can see phase 1 and it is called the Subsi 1, 2 and 3 and then you see the phase 2 development wells in lighter blue and even lighter blue is the phase 3 development and as we go around from the initial three well development that we\u2019ve planned that will add 15,000 barrels per day in 2016 that\u2019s on track and expanding the drilling results could add up to 75,000 barrels a day to by 2020. So this project continue to drill out above the expectations and therefore its budget is going to be expanded.  The hosting deep production profile on page 20 given representative if we talk about cash flows and timing for your modeling purposes but it\u2019s a very significant project for the company going forward. On page 21 is our detailed area, Power Nap [ph] discovery the reason I\u2019m seeing the picture you see up in the top left corner of detailed development discovery show operates Power Nap [ph] just at the East of that two red dots is another discovery these are net DOE exposure to Freeport McMoRan oil and gas. And you can see just to the south of Parnell, deep sweep oil to the very depth part of the basin which is kind of separated but the Parnell discovery and then we have our Sun project down for the south east which is 240 million barrel in that project and is about 384 million barrel. All in all, I\u2019ll skip ravioli in detail, it is smaller but it is about a billion barrels of oil net in the company and this is the most significant long term play that the company has in its books today. You can see the extremely thick column at the Alan four stands upper and lower fence in our detail discovery well, it\u2019s a great size and signature it takes all over the mini basin.  So, when you pull up the page 22, you look at our plan going forward for the next 10 years. You can see production growing from various 130,000, 140,000 barrels to-date over 600,000 a day. The key about this line that we want to put in there is the estimated reserve, refresh ratio for next five years is 137% by any cost going forward $26 a barrel and $21 a barrel within your model is it all these assets are in hand most of these are all been discovered or have validation within the basin, all of our gas assets in Haynesville and Cretaceous as gas recovered later in this decade. A California assets, specific Green Canyon, the Vito Area, there is no additional exploration, there is no additional outside business acquisitions in this model. This is all what\u2019s in hand. So, just following our playbook, we can increase production at least 3X through our company on the oil side. Now, work talking about right now internally and externally is timing because the assets are there, the equipment is there and so forth and the cost structure is there. When you look at our five year finding cost structure at $26 a barrel and just take our average LOE forecast is about 15 bucks a barrel, it's 18 right now, it's about 50 bucks going forward because our fixed assets have fixed costs and when you have more volumes to you dilute the per barrel cost. Now if you take 26 bucks and 15 bucks is about $41 a barrel and you add $5 corporate cost. You buy $46 a barrel all in cost for oil and gas business. In a $65 to $70 oil market we make a lot of money in this business. There is very little risk because of the risk we're taking and the way we de-risk it with the drill bit, it's very little risk from the execution standpoint because the equipment and platforms are in place. So we're very excited about that and we've been working all internally with everyone here at Freeport to figure out the best way to fund these assets going forward. On page 23, I just want to highlight two different ways to think about our business. #1, the current plan, which is what in our corporate projections of 2015, 2016 and 2017 production volumes and EBITDA's on the top right and then if we're able to bring in additional funding that would accelerate that business and get us up to a production level that would allow us to be self funding in a much faster level. The model is in the lower right hand corner, which is the growth plan assuming additional funding. And what happens here is because of all the wells we drill and so forth we're really talking about how fast we hook them up -- how fast we put the equipment in to bring that production on and so forth. So, for us we're going to be very stingy about it from the standpoint of funding. We've looked for funding sources in the first quarter. We found some that were wrenched in and anticipating or very expensive and we looked around that we found some others that make a lot more sense. And right now, the public sale or public equities for minority interest FMO&G is something that we're working on and we're going to probably have a decision on that here this quarter to where we file a document and getting registrations as Richard said for the summer and look at raise some money in the fall our JV monetization and/or divestitures. Divestitures are they help patch the hole but they don't solve the problems. So, the IPO alternative of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas on page 24 abides that an alternative fund of -- way to fund the business, but the key thing we think it does is highlight the standalone value for oil and gas business. There is a big disconnect between the value of our oil and gas business within Freeport-McMoRan today and the public market perception is stand alone. I guess we have had more success than anybody with the drill bed in the last two years and it's caused more spending but it is also likely reflected in our equity. So the aspect of being able to get that visibility for the Freeport shareholder we think is an important part of it. FCX solely plans to maintain control in majority ownership of the business and the case study is obviously Freeport done as before the FCX IPO, we did it planes with planes exploration, we funded out of PXP \u2013 PLX and the best of our IPO that from ARCO in 1994 that really funded their deepwater discovery developments in 1994 when the deepwater was first showing up and which really is a big part of BP portfolio today. The timing might \u2013 it is early as late 15 or this market conditions stable we are going to be patient for the standpoint and we'll continue to assess other alternatives and have other discussions in other areas in the interim certainly from that standpoint. Richard, back to you to talk about the 2015 outlook? Richard Adkerson : Okay, thanks Jim. We want to give you this overview of our assets and make sure that you can sense what our degree of excitement is about the scope of our assets of both our mining business and our oil and gas business. And I want to talk about how this comes together financially for us, as we move forward with our plans for developing them. First of all looking at the near term for 2015 we are looking at sales of 4.2 billion pounds of copper, 1.3 million ounces of gold, 95 million pounds of molybdenum and 52.3 million barrels equivalent of oil, 67% of that is oil. The operating cash flows that would be generated at 275 copper would be 4.4 billion and we\u2019re highly leveraged to copper for the rest of the year $0.10 changes in copper is $250 million. The unit cost is an attractive $1.53 for copper and as Jim said $19 a barrel for oil for this year. Our capital expenditure reflect a $500 million adjustment for our oil and gas business at 6.5 billion as we move forward and you can see as we look beyond 2015 as we go to Slide 26, the volumes increase significantly as we talked about earlier both for copper, gold with support from molybdenum in our oil project where we will be preparing for longer-term growth through our investment activities there. Our copper sales for the quarter will be growing as I mentioned earlier throughout the year and that information is presented on Slide 27. Our 2015 operating estimates for our unit cost for copper shows the effects of the higher volumes with continued cost controls. We\u2019re now looking at projections of $1.53 a pound consolidated for copper and you can see our sales are divided by region. The EBITDA models and cash flow models that we present each quarter presented on Slide 29 as an average for the next for 2016 and 2017. Average EBITDA at various copper prices would go to 1,200 and oil at $70. This approximates the current strip for \u201916 and \u201917. You can see EBITDA ranging from 250 copper at 8.6 billion to 13.7 billion and 350 and operating cash flows range from 6.6 billion at 250 up to 10.3 billion at 350. The sensitivities for our different commodities and currencies are presented on Slide 30 for your use. Our capital expenditure, plans as they current stand are shown on Slide 31. You can see declining from 7.4 last year to the new estimate 6.5 this year, 5.6 and 5.1 and we\u2019re going to be evaluating these as we go forward but this is what our current plan is as we stand now. We are committed to maintaining financial strength and we have a strong track record for doing that. Our large resource base gives us strong cash flows and we will exercise capital discipline and how we invest for the future with taking significant steps to reduce cost and capital expenditures, increasing volumes, declining CapEx that\u2019s going to help our existing credit metrics and we are advancing plans for external funds as Jim just talked about. We have available liquidity under our FCX revolver and we have a facility at Cerro Verde that together provide us $4 billion of availability at the end of March. So our key priorities as we go forward is to maintain our financial strength, manage our operations and our CapEx to maximize near term cash flows in an uncertain commodity market, but to look forward to this great set of assets that we have for future growth, future value creation we\u2019re really going to be focused on executing our plans for our near term mining projects in our oil and gas investments and to generate values for our large resource base. Before we turn the call over for questions, Jim Bob\u2019s here and he has some comments to be made about our company\u2019s culture and how we\u2019re approaching the current environment based on the successes we\u2019ve had over many years in the past. Jim Bob? Jim Bob Moffett : Thank you, Richard. As you look on Slide 34, 1981 [indiscernible] [indiscernible] In 1988 year remember we did an IPO of FCX [indiscernible] we had a deposit [indiscernible] we had to rely on our geologic instincts to know that this was a major find and as you know after the drilling that we did, we end up with the largest oil body in the world. Copper, gold and silver. In 1990 we developed gas pipe [indiscernible] how to manage that business which is we had a discovery in the middle of [indiscernible] 13,000 feet and we had already $6 billion [indiscernible] used resource and mortgage, we got gold bond, silver bond and then we made a major change [indiscernible]. I remind everybody that [indiscernible] really set the tone [indiscernible] shareholders [indiscernible] 100% of what they own and we already gave up reserves in the future. When FCX was went off the [indiscernible] $6 billion [indiscernible] acquisition, not only did we created the largest publicly traded copper producer but remember we had the instinct [indiscernible] geologic instincts we were able to drill these [indiscernible] imagine doubling the reserves [indiscernible] so my observations [indiscernible] in the first part [indiscernible] CEO and then and Jim [indiscernible] 2013 [indiscernible] we didn\u2019t have the benefit of [indiscernible] the way we can profile oil and gas prospects we didn\u2019t have the benefit of [indiscernible] we rejected the [indiscernible] in the case of the oil and gas [indiscernible] we got these [indiscernible] that are outlined [indiscernible] information but when you look at the discoveries that Jim has referred to [indiscernible] Power Nap [indiscernible] just offset [indiscernible] discovery was made [indiscernible] so we [indiscernible] oil and gas property in the Eagleford [indiscernible] over $4 billion so we\u2019ve done what we said we intended to do now what we have to do is to take advantage of the [indiscernible] that we have this growth profile which has been the history of our company [indiscernible] complete major projects [indiscernible] challenge but remember we acquired [indiscernible] acquisition platforms [indiscernible] three platforms now with the price drop $150 a barrel you can just imagine that we have a monopoly on the deepwater [indiscernible] platforms [indiscernible] on those assets for several years [indiscernible] happen in [indiscernible] facilities. We had geologic engineering teams working at the best place to put these platforms, so [indiscernible] acquire these in 2013 but today [indiscernible] price drop from $100 a barrel to $50 a barrel [indiscernible] platforms [indiscernible] justify. So lot of the production has been around our platforms aided by Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas by third parties who come to our facilities [indiscernible] equity [indiscernible] platform we have about 250,000 barrels capacity and when you compare that [indiscernible] which was of course the first one built in Freeport had a lot of lead time because [indiscernible] some of the engineering [indiscernible] about ten years [indiscernible] about $10 million to put that facility out there. We have about the same capacity [audio-gap] three platforms that we have. So as usual [indiscernible] this history of [indiscernible] geologic engineering big projects so although [indiscernible] just imagine the resources that we [indiscernible] $20 billion [indiscernible] facility [indiscernible] starting to turn around the [indiscernible] which was pointed out [indiscernible] in Asia [indiscernible] export barrel that was not just copper but [indiscernible] complete restructuring of the market [indiscernible] labor union situations there. Nobody was [indiscernible] when copper was $1 but when copper went up to $1 billion we owned up to $3 or $4 [indiscernible] part of the world-wide phenomenon we as I said we found the [indiscernible] copper was less than $1 and gold was $400 an ounce so when you look at where we are today [indiscernible] as I said we completed this 20 billion [indiscernible] expansion [indiscernible] the benefit this major investment we\u2019ve made [indiscernible] PXP MMR acquisition so [indiscernible] company [indiscernible] shows that we successfully managed some of the biggest projects in the world [indiscernible] oil and gas [indiscernible] not only managed from a clinical standpoint but managed it from a financial standpoint so [indiscernible] chance to what we\u2019ve done with our assets we\u2019ve always proven that we know how to manage risk we know how to manage the [indiscernible] projects and no matter how remote they are we are a leader in the industry and with what we\u2019ve put together with our asset base we\u2019re in a position now to really show [indiscernible] of what the [indiscernible] oil and gas [indiscernible]. So this is [indiscernible] whole team here [indiscernible] oil and gas experts [indiscernible]. Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Thanks Jim Bob. And we\u2019re ready to open up the lines for questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment please for our first question. Your first question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Tony Rizzuto : I\u2019ve got a couple of questions here. First of all, I think many people on this line today are surprised to see increase in CapEX especially after the nearly 85% dividend cut and obviously at a time when you\u2019re burning a lot of cash. Having you exhausted all opportunities to cut cost and CapEx elsewhere and if 2015 is the bridge year, why not take on some additional debt here instead of diluting shareholder interest further? Jim Flores : That\u2019s a very complex question. I\u2019ll tell you we have gone through an exercise of looking at our capital cost across our business and coming up with a plan that we believe reflects the objective of limiting cost in the current environment, while protecting our assets and positioning us to take advantage of them over the long-term. So we\u2019ve clearly done that now and we can respond in more details about that Tony. The issue of funding more debt is we started with strong objective which we communicated with the market following both the announcement of the oil and gas deal in December 12 and the closing of the transaction in mid \u201913 was that we were going to be focused on reducing our debt because of our belief that the nature of our assets can best the managed and position for growth with the balance sheet that\u2019s strong. We have a strong balance sheet. We are an investment grade rate company and we want to take actions to protect that investment grade rating. We believe that\u2019s important for the credit markets, for the equity markets but also how we manage some of our reclamation obligations where we\u2019re able to use corporate guarantees as an investment grade rated company. So you mix this all together and our view has been that we should take steps not to grow debt, but to position ourselves to reduce debt overtime and then our board make the decision to reduce our dividend for now. We\u2019ve reduced it in 2008 as you recall and as markets recovered we aggressively increased it as the markets changed. My view is that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen in the future, but we needed to take into account the uncertainties of the near term market conditions, position our company for future growth and for delivering our balance sheet in years beyond 2016. We do not have current plans to issue equity for the parent company. We as Jim talked about this issue of getting highlights on the value of our oil and gas business, the idea of potentially issuing equity at that level, we could see it has benefits both in terms of highlighting those values, but also giving us the opportunity to look at a broader range of funding within that entity as a public entity. So we can see some benefits for it by the nature of doing that it takes time. You have to file registration statement with the SEC, go through review process and for us to have that alternative that filing would be required that doesn\u2019t mean that we would be fully committed to doing it that will be based on our view of all the alternatives we have and how the markets develop as we go forward with one of our fingers in the markets at all place and we\u2019re going to evaluate all alternatives and take the actions that best to our shareholders. Tony Rizzuto : Okay and then again just I switch gears for a moment. Just the production at the couple places. First at the Grass Paver the production was 20% below your January guide or estimate are mainly due to lower mining. So I\u2019m wondering and you kind of indicated that it will prove through the quarter. Could you bring update where you were at quarter\u2019s end in relation to capacity there? Richard Adkerson : Yes, one of the things to keep in mind is that we are ramping down the mining of waste there, in fact by the end of this year we will essentially have mine all of the waste in the Grass Paver pit, that\u2019s the material that allows us to get to the bottom of the pit and as we go forward we\u2019ll be mining ore and some low grade material that we\u2019re stock piling to provide throughput formula as we ramp up Grass Paver blockage. So for you Tony and those of us who have been following this for a long time, we need to adjust our view of what mining rates are there because that\u2019s not part of the Indonesian government issues or the labor union this is just the normal mine plan. Now we did have a work stoppage that was not a union action during the first quarter and some of the labor issues within our work force continue to be complicated. But that did not last long and by the end of the quarter we are essentially operating on a normal fashion and so that had an impact not only for a very short period of time when we had a work stoppage, but it\u2019s affected the some absenteeism issues, it affects some productivity issue and we\u2019ve been dealing with this labor issues now since 2011. But we now are back to a normal fashion we have negotiations with our unions coming up this year and we have confidence going into that, we got our union contract completed 2 years ago and it\u2019s relative straight forward fashion and we\u2019re building more positive relationships with union. But there are other issues within our work force that we\u2019ll have to continue to deal with. So one is look at where we are with our commandment in the fit with money rates going down and then we are working with some ongoing labor issues that had an impact in the first quarter and we\u2019re going to work hard to minimize that impact and we think we can going forward in the 2015 going in the last 3 quarter. Tony Rizzuto : Alright, Richard. So strip ratios improve as you go through or should allow more normal or lesser rate of absenteeism. So lower unit cost and the other question I had was on server day and in the text talked about higher repair maintenance expense and higher mining cost. Is that all and preparation for the expansion  [Audio Gap] Richard Adkerson : \u2026\u2026based anymore. We are just following our plan. On the way and now we are down to where we\u2019re going to be mining. Since we are after this year or for the mill currently and some low grade material that we stockpiling to provide mill throughput [Audio Gap] when complete mining in the pit and ramping up the underground bucket. So all of that and as I said that\u2019s what we will be doing under any set of circumstances and before I turn it reed I want to, Kathleen give me a good note to follow up on the earlier conversation about delusion. We have the ability to fund the plan that you see under our current revolver which we have $4 billion of availability at the end of the quarter and under the current plan we\u2019ve got to deal with the commodity prices whatever they will be hard prices or lower prices causes us to respond to those but we have the ability to bar temporarily under our credit facility and then if we get in the 2016 and generate cash flows even at today\u2019s prices we see that facility to coming back available to us in full force. So it's -- we don\u2019t have the need to do a -- we don\u2019t have an absolute requirement to do external financing to execute the plan that you see today. We're focused on how to take advantage of these oil and gas assets to provide funding for its opportunities that separate apart from our overall corporate financial plan. Jim Flores : Tony just quickly, it\u2019s already we've brought additional trucks down from our other operations, 10 trucks this year that again is one of the strengths of our company where we could do that with support from other mining operations and our good equipment availabilities. So we're advancing the mining, they are making sure that, that fits in great shape and able to defeat this new big concentrator that is being built on schedule as Richard pointed out. So, we have taken some of the mining equipment to help with the construction of the starter temporarily and again to do all of that and achieve to facility, so it did cause a variance in the first quarter. Jim Bob Moffett : If look at where we are today actually we have been spent $20 billion [indiscernible] planning [indiscernible] trying to measure oil and gas, [indiscernible] during the year we saw there is $4.5 billion worth of assets [indiscernible] there is [indiscernible] what we have to do this year we're pushing the right buttons. Thank you -- if I just [indiscernible] stop looking [indiscernible] make sure they were using debt [indiscernible] have in the past[indiscernible] but most importantly the ability for any company imagine a company our size [indiscernible] 20 billion of middle of the expansion [indiscernible] Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jorge Beristain : May be this question is meant for Kathleen, but where are we right now with the carrying value or the book value of your oil and gas assets as of this latest write-down and if you could just give me both the 100% book value and then the net to Freeport. Kathleen Quirk : Okay. Jorge, if you look you can find that on our balance sheet, we've got that details so you can see what the balances were at the end of the quarter compared to where it was at the year end. The full cost accounting rules which we talked about in the past require that we assess the ceiling each quarter. And it's important to keep in mind that that formula we are using approved reserves. So, we've -- as Jim talked about during the comments we have really expanded our resources those haven\u2019t been converted yet into proved reserves and SEC requirements under full cost accounting requires to use a 12 month trailing average for oil and gas prices. So that's why you saw that charge in the fourth quarter and a subsequent charge in the first quarter. The trailing number for oil is roughly $83. So we could have a oil prices stay below that we could have additional charges in the second and third quarter until the 12-month trailing averages is trued up. But you can see here we've got on the balance sheet we\u2019ve got $6.7 billion in the oil and gas property and that\u2019s the -- essentially the proved reserves and then additional 9.7 billion that's not in the full cost ceiling. And that\u2019s the net of depreciation. Jim Flores : This is Jim, just on an operational basis, oil and gas areas like Holstein Deep are deep are detailed base and our high Lander. All those are not in our approved category yet and that\u2019s how we can manage our funding cost at our proved reserves growth from. We have a huge pipeline of projects that will become proved this year and next year and the following year already established. Jorge Beristain : I\u2019m just trying to sort of get out of ahead of what a book value could look like for this unit at time of IPO and we\u2019ve just run a quick sensitivity if we just hold a Brent crude constant over the next 4 quarters and just kind of see what the trailing 4 quarter historical looks like. It looks like you could still be in for but another 3 billion of rate downs in 2Q maybe a billion and half in 3Q and that\u2019s not including the stock you are proving up that you are mentioning this not in your book value yet. But I\u2019m just trying to get an idea of if those kind of order of magnitudes seem correct you and what kind of book value do you actually see having by 4Q that the present takes? Jim Flores : That looks high to us. If we were to have calculated our full cost sealing test at the end of March using the current strip prices there would have been approximately a $2 billion incremental higher right down at the end of March, SEC rules wouldn\u2019t allow us to do that and because we\u2019ve to use this 12 month average. But if you were to go forward and say the strict prices would be realized over the forward, the numbers would be closure to $2 billion than $3 billion and $3.5 billion. Jorge Beristain : I\u2019m sure that\u2019s because as you was seeing spot health constant not the forward strip. But that is helpful and then to Jim\u2019s comment earlier, could you give us an order of magnitude of what you think the offset that could be coming against those futures right downs would be by the proving up or the conversion of resources to reserves? Jim Flores : The aspect that is going to be fully engineered and I strictly feel at this point all right that the difference is of having so much of it discovered in the last 2 years and not hit the approved category, the price function, the actual operating function and we push to our capital like we\u2019ve been pushing our capital that slows down the proved booking process. So there is, If I can figure out exactly what capital we have where the external going forward what the acceleration of those developments were and what prices were, I can answer your question lot closure than just saying is a positive trend. I think it\u2019s the best way to talk about it because the inventory is full. It\u2019s just the matter of all those factors and coming together what actually gets booked and what don\u2019t. But the resources are there. Richard Adkerson : I\u2019m sure you understand this but just to be clear, once you write something down even though prices may come back, you have future reserves, you don\u2019t write it backup under our accounting system. The book value stays there, what higher prices or higher reserves would do and it\u2019s important to note that reserves are function of prices as well. As prices go higher economic limits extend and reserve volumes increasing, lower prices put limits on how much reserves you can add at a particular point in time. But that could tend to offset this $2 billion number we\u2019re talking about. It wouldn\u2019t result and ride up our past right now. Jim Flores : And you are going to see our rate in the oil & gas unit because of the right downs be more critical to our final cost going forward and will be an ad reserve that finding cost which will be beneficial or par with our DDNA rate versus what\u2019s it been at the end of last year was $40 plus and this could be 20S doesn\u2019t the right down I guess going forward. Jim Bob Moffett : [indiscernible] when you talk about resources if you look at the map in detail. [indiscernible] resources you see there [indiscernible] drilled and undrilled the important part of that would [indiscernible] All those have been drilled so that number you see going from $75 million to $270 million and have [indiscernible] so we have two kind of resources on these maps. [indiscernible] full cost raised and then its separate, you know we had a green color for resources and red color for reserve. We have lot of in this category right now. Jorge Beristain : Fully understood and I appreciate the extra color and just lastly Jim on page 22 at the PowerPoint are those projection for the potential tripling of your production based on the assumption that you are self funded or is that assuming extra capital comes into the company. Jim Flores : That\u2019s a lot assuming, extra capital comes in the company. What it does, it will just \u2013 if it does and that we self funded ourselves that just means it\u2019s a slower slop and it would extend the peak cap beyond 2025. So everything just shift forward into the future years at the slower pace but we can accelerate with the additional funding that comes in. Jorge Beristain : Got it. Thank you. Jim Flores : And let me just say everyone these forecast accounting rules are complicated and logical in certain respects in today\u2019s world and so if you have questions call David and he will answer them or he will arrange for our people to walk you through. So, we\u2019ll make sure everybody understands what this is and what it is. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Yu with Citi. Please go ahead. Brian Yu : Good, thanks. First question is just on oil and gas on page 23 of the presentation where we can see the improvement EBITDA between additional funding versus without additional funding. But I increase \u2013 if incorporate the increased CapEx notes under both scenarios are the net number is about a negative 3.9 billion unlevered free cash flow for 2015 and 2017. So, in the context with the impressive IRIs that were laid out on page 15 at the handout. When should the energy business start generating positive free cash on a standalone basis under those assumptions? Jim Flores : It would be at 2017 at a $74 oil price. As the assumptions, so if it\u2019s not \u2013 so if oil is not $74 in 2017 it will be in 2018 and setting forth, so functional price and also the production scheduling wise. Brian Yu : Okay. In 2017, there is still about a $400 million sure fall. Richard Adkerson : At these prices you have to --. Brian Yu : Okay. I guess maybe I can ask you just because at the IRI deal work so specifically a lot higher than what we would typically see for the mining business. I\u2019m just trying to figure out where the disconnect is versus the projections versus the more bottoms up individual project analysis. Jim Flores : Its probably in the snapshot of the three years from the stand point of scheduling what projects are being funded in 2017 that will affect 2018, 2019 productions. So it\u2019s a function of prices and also production schedule out there and when we sold the Eagle Ford and took that big chunk of production out of our production profile still in that whole we can debate a long time when we get it down but sooner we fill it with production and then we start to worry about the price, the simple our model with become and all the way to do that to schedule our wells being hooked up that we drilled already at a faster rate with outside funding. That\u2019s the model and understand your frustration but you imagine trying to put together a static model for you guys with so many moving parts with depending on what capital is coming on the door. Richard Adkerson : The other thing we have is through this period you see through 2017 we have existing rate contracts that were contracted for couple of years back. What we are seeing is cost coming down and so we\u2019ll be able post 2017 to do more with less cost. So, you\u2019ll see the capital expenditure numbers reflecting longer term reflecting lower cost of rigs and service cost etcetera. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Captial. Please go ahead. David Gagliano : I have two questions related to the capital spending issue and may be you've already covered some of this, but I just -- I still don\u2019t understand. On the oil and gas site CapEx went up by about a billion, obviously volumes went up only 10% on 2017. So my question is actually tied to slide 22. How much of the growth between 2018 and 2020 in oil and gas on slide 22 is now covered or whatever by these updated capital spending plans and how much more CapEx would be needed to get to the 400 billion barrels per day target by 2020. That's my question on the oil and gas side. And then on the copper side, can you -- I missed this. What were the main drivers for the $300 million increase in copper spending since the last conference call. Jim Flores : Well, the second part is -- we don't have. What you focusing on there because we haven\u2019t really\u2026 Kathleen Quirk : The capital we're spending in 2015 is 3.7 that\u2019s the same as what it was before. Actually we've taken down CapEx in 2016 and 17 by a total of 300 million, it's 300 million -- David Gagliano : I think that we got that one backwards. So that\u2019s helpful. That answers that one. Okay, and then on the oil and gas side? Jim Flores : Kathleen, keep going. Richard Adkerson : David, the swing areas is, we got two types of capital. You got your drilling capital and capping alluded to the costs are covered down the spread right, I think we have 10% reduction this year. 15%, 20% and the 30% as we have passed 17, reduce the -- some of the drilling costs. Assuming those costs continued to go down. But the other big thing is the timing of the completions and the completion capital. That\u2019s really our variable capital in our budget, our discretionary capital. So I can't emphasize enough the quip to your question is, it's going to be how much we spend early enough to get the production response so we\u2019re self funded with the production versus continue and breed along without the capital, without the capital early because if we're going to slow our program down we could show for the next -- in two years, we could be totally self funding the 17 based on the $75 oil price and ramping up production and close the gap that Brian highlighted. Okay. Or we could spend four years at a slow pace spending us less amount of money and continuing to fund the deficit, you get to the same point. And we have that flexibility and the assets. And that\u2019s where the question of we've been wrestling with here Freeport as to what's the best thing for the shareholders and that\u2019s why we're exploring the external option of the IPO, to accelerate that business so it becomes self funding faster versus the -- versus the longer debt spend at the slower burn. David Gagliano : Okay, is there a way just to give a number on 2018 to 2020 incremental capital needed to get to the 400 million barrels or is that just not --? Jim Flores : The incremental capital is a function of how what, there is some base plan to what we're talking about, the current plan or the high growth plan without high capital. David Gagliano : I am basically talking about the chart on slide 22. How much capital did you need to get to the 400 million barrels of oil a day by 2020? Jim Flores : That would easy thing, be from this what forward it would be as reflected in the numbers here on page 23, it would be the 3.8 billion in 16 and $3.5 billion in 17 on a aide X basis and depending on what's has been it's the delta between that would be the additional capitals. We were projected 2018 through 2020 and be self funding through the EBITA growth. I know __ how that the EBITDA growth and or the EBITDA in 18-20, but it's not a negative number, it\u2019s positive. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Curt Woodworth with Nomura. Please go ahead. Curt Woodworth : Jim I wanted if you can address what incremental CapEx would be under the funding scenario, looks like you're looking for about 1.5 billion of incremental spend, in \u201916 or \u201917 and can you also talk about why you think an IPO would be more preferable to try to structure either JV or a partnership on a project basis. Jim Flores : Well it all depends on what the market -- what market's out there and so forth. Currently, the market that we see is a market that has capital in it from a JV basis, but everybody has got a lot of projects to do and there is not a lot of discretionary capital, those are very expensive. The private equity market is very expensive as well because they re-capital other existing businesses. We\u2019re just looking forward the best former capital. I mean we\u2019ve got a fabulous growth profile in our business. We\u2019ve drilled the well taking the risk. We certainly not going to give them away just because we don\u2019t want to borrow money. Here that\u2019s not purgative. We want to make sure we find the lowest cheapest cost to capital and with the best benefits and the benefits are getting the visibility borrowed by our shareholders to what we\u2019ve achieved and what in the performance of oil & gas business along with what we think is a inexpensive form of equity for Freeport McMoRan in the form of equity at SMLG make some sense. Again like we\u2019re just said we\u2019re studying, we\u2019ve helped that go to this process and right now it looks the most favorable because the industry just issued $8 billion of equity here in the pretty dynamic environment. So right now that\u2019s a very viable into for us and we encourage while allow the investment banks to pursue it. Jim Bob Moffett : [indiscernible] these 3 platform that we have that are pushing in you deep water side are the [indiscernible]. You should imagine those as magnets. These people [indiscernible] including our sale. We have a [indiscernible] market for this is we are totaling with people[indiscernible] difference is the [indiscernible] the diamonds if they made a [indiscernible] ] facility [indiscernible] Curt Woodworth : Okay, thanks. Richard just a question on the need can you comment on kind of how the discussions are going with the MOU and specifically what the plan would be for these sell down of PTFI I understand I think the new mining were acquired some additional 19% to 20% stake reduction with the government having the first right to acquire that, so I\u2019m just curious on where that stands and how do you think that could be resolved actually. Jim Flores : That is one of the points discovered in the MOU and the government has regulations that applied to different types of mining arrangements they have to existing mines so forth with in terms of our working with the government and reconciling our contract of work which requires no divestitures and the governments new regulations. The MOU reflects a mutual agreement that we would increase the current 9.36% interest owned by the government to 30% over the time and as you said the way that would be approached that would be part of the set of points that we would agree to and getting the extension of our rights to operate under except gold. Physical terms is that within the pursued over time in steps. The agreement is that the sales would at fair value and the first step would be offering it to the government we\u2019ve talked about having a piece of that ultimately through a listing on the Indonesian stock exchange and the government officials have expressed positive aspects of that, the province of pop was indicated an aspiration to own symmetry and we do some financial structures to accomplish that. All of this would come in to play as part of reaching a resolution of the long term operating rights that we have but the MOU covers the extent of the future divestiture. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera of Bank of America Merill Lynch. Please go ahead. Oscar Cabrera : Just I wanted to get back to the \u2013 in general want to get back to oil and gas question that couple of people asked and if I may, increase your CapEx from 15% to 17% by 1.6 billion with that increase in CapEx will we get to again \u2013 slide 22 has approximately 225,000 barrels a day which my math is about 82 million barrels a year of oil equivalent. Can we assume that that\u2019s the figure that you\u2019re looking for in 2018? Jim Flores : Out of the growth plan, yes with additional capital, that\u2019s correct. So, if this is not something that is committed to all the future growth plan, it\u2019s an opportunity for us and we\u2019re going to assessing whether \u2013 what we\u2019ve given you in our budget plans that\u2019s part of the presentation is where we are today with our capital spending plans. We have opportunities provided we can get capital through a variety of sources. Cark mentioned the joint venture opportunity with other companies whether there is financing at a property level, whether there is financing available at the entity level. And if we\u2019re able to \u2013 possible to get funding on the reasonable basis to pursue the growth plan the chart that you\u2019re referring to as what would be achieved under that plan. If we aren\u2019t able to, if we conclude that the cost of capital is to expensive than we will give you guidance as to how that would work out under our base plan and the opportunities won\u2019t go away, its like the projects we suspended in 2008 in our mining business. Cerro Verde being pursued before that we suspended it. It didn\u2019t go away and now we\u2019re developed it later.  So, we have rights to these resources that are long term and we will be managing how we spend money, how we finance that spending in a way that responsive to market conditions, and market conditions are changing as we speak and so we\u2019re going to have our figures on all of these sources of financing and we\u2019ll make decisions and we will advice the market as to what the consequences of those decisions would be as we go forward. Oscar Cabrera : Okay. Maybe if I ask the question this way. On slide 31, you have oil and gas expenditures in 2015, 2016 and 2017 at $2.8 billion, $2.9 billion and $2.9 billion. This compared to the last presentation is $1.6 billion more. So, you presenting in 2017 oil and gas fields of 63 million barrels. So, with additional capital that we increase from last time we talked in the conference call to now will that give you additional production of oil and gas in 2018. I assume so and I\u2019m just trying to assess what\u2019s the level? Is the level the one that you\u2019re showing in slide 22 and I can appreciate that there opportunities. Jim Flores : That\u2019s slide 23, that\u2019s the current plan on top with the current, our current funding that\u2019s reflects on page 31, reflects in the current plan and this what I was talking about. If we continue to put off the completion and hoop up and facilities need to add new production as we drill it, as we \u2013 we\u2019ve already drilled it in the last two years than we will not see a show up in the production numbers. Okay? It will in the current plan, their production aren\u2019t going anywhere like we\u2019re just talking about and it will take longer years forward to get all that production. So on a three year outlook you\u2019ll miss some of that production if we raise the additional fund and we\u2019re able to put the wells on that we\u2019ve already drilled on the timely basis then you will see the graphs at the lower portion when gross 1.43 to 2.17 and the additional funding required and our variable funding is the completion dollars which affects the timing and that\u2019s when I think it was David heard whatever I wanted 18 to 20 will tell you where you can see the reflection basically in the current plan we would hit the same 217 of few year further out because of this delay of spending in that funding. Oscar Cabrera : Okay. Thank you. Then in terms of the equity raise or potential equity rise. I\u2019m assuming based on your comments that this will be at the oil and gas business level. How much or have you sort of upto what levels Freeport McMaRan holding company would be willing to dilute of its holding in the oil and gas business. Jim Flores : We are under some restrictions under the securities law about how much we can talk about details part following which duration registration segment and getting SEC review. We can\u2019t say this Freeport McMaRon [indiscernible] a significant majority interest in that FCX would retain a significant majoriy interest in Freeport McMarRon I don\u2019t\u2019 want to guess and the amount of the offering in terms that will dependant on market condition when we\u2019re ready to inter the market and we cannot do that because of the procedure of requirement of the SEC review. Oscar Cabrera : Okay, then lastly just if I may just a comment and a question. So the comment is just I wanted to thank congratulations for the achievements already. I think that\u2019s being remarkable our project and then the question. You have a comment here on your release talking about the MOU in Grasberg and it says no terms of this the COW all that and those relating to expert duties, smelter burn and increase royalties will be changed. Can you clarify that like is the government still trying to increase royalties or change beyond? Jim Flores : Let me clarify that those who are agreed to last summer when we assigned the original MOU. We agreed to increase royalties to the current royalties under the mining law and there is no further adjustments to that, we also agree to put assurity bond of $115 million to demonstrate our seriousness about pursuing the smelter deal. There is no adjustment to that and then we agreed to pay an export duty on a sliding scale. All of that was agreed to in the summer of 2014 and none of those terms were changed when we extended the MOU in January and they are not we\u2019re not being approached for further changes along those lines. Oscar Cabrera : Okay, great. Thanks very much for your answers. Jim Bob Moffett : It is Jim, I want to give you a little color on, the questions you asked about the capital less area production and then you said the same for you. We have this platform where keep talking about there have been about $60 billion worth of platform. [indiscernible] production to be increased to these capacity and the interim camp between every [indiscernible] and what we\u2019ve done to date. We now drill well [indiscernible] there are 100 of fees to pay [indiscernible] not guessing because of you want to be resources being drill and [indiscernible]. so we have the platform in there, we have the wells that are getting drill. The question mark is how much money do you spend across the capital. [indiscernible] you get the oil from the well on the platform that\u2019s already been drilled, already in our [indiscernible] paid for [indiscernible] genius is around here. Extraordinary things, but mission impossible is to say what\u2019s the right decision [indiscernible] to date because that\u2019s going to depend on what the price is [indiscernible] so you understand the difference between the risk factor. Platforms are built the well drill and you [indiscernible] when we heard about [indiscernible] Oscar Cabrera : That was just all right. Understood. It\u2019s just coming from doing about 15 years of mining research. Oil and gas is new and we\u2019re just learning about this risk and it looks from a distance it looks that oil and gas and deepwater is lot more riskier than onshore and that\u2019s why we\u2019re trying to establish the parameters to give you the right value for those assets but thank you for your comments. Jim Bob Moffett : [Indiscernible] then you got a good teacher and Jim Bob\u2019s the best teacher in oil and gas as you\u2019ve ever heard of. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS. Please go ahead. Brian MacArthur : My question is coming on [indiscernible] but I just want to go back to the Grasberg capital. You\u2019ve got the five year forecast your share from 700 million to 600 million, but then you make a comment that there\u2019s an additional 300 million a year for the next five years for underground ore handling et cetera. My first question on that is that all yours [indiscernible] to fund some of that? Kathy Quirk : [Indiscernible] does fund some of that Brian the percentage varies depending on the share of production. And that\u2019s nothing new, those numbers were always in our plan. You see in the CapEx schedules that we will reduce some of the CapEx in 2016 to 2017 that is related to timing of some of those expenditures that we\u2019ve pushed out, but those capital expenditures from no modifications and power upgrades have always been part of our plan. Brian MacArthur : Right so that\u2019s where it\u2019s soft then it is fairly back-end loaded so a lot of that spending would be if I\u2019m trying to look at things out in \u201918 there\u2019ll be much higher numbers out in \u201918 as you spent a instead of like 600 million a year you\u2019d be spending closer to $1 billion a year should I think of it that way? Kathy Quirk : Yes I mean as we do \u2013 we\u2019re planning when we need to do these no modifications and highlight handling and power upgrade and we\u2019re going to do it prudently and with an eye on trying to match it up with when we ultimately need it, but yes we\u2019ll have some of those expenditures will be higher in \u201918, \u201919 timeframe. Brian MacArthur : And do you need to \u2013 so the forecast you\u2019re giving us for those years \u201819 to \u201821 because the production figures have moved around a little bit. Do you need to do that to get to those numbers that you\u2019re talking but i.e., if you don\u2019t do this will production be lower because of some complex metallurgy or something or do you need to do these for sure just to get to those forecast levels? Kathy Quirk : Yes what we need to do and what we need to do is reflected in our long range plans. Jim Flores : But some of this has been adjusted because the completion of the pit was originally supposed occur into 2016. Brian MacArthur : Right. Jim Flores : It\u2019s been extended [audio-gap]. Jim Flores : \u2026estimates because the effects of worldwide global energy cost and the lower cost of steel and things like that so we have some impact not a huge impact from currency changes so but the basic plan has not changed what we\u2019re going to do little bit of change to when we\u2019re going to do it and some of that on the absolute amount of cost because of the changing global commodity prices. Brian MacArthur : Great. Thank you very much for that color, that\u2019s helpful. Jim Bob Moffett : Let me \u2013 this is Jim Bob, let me address [indiscernible] rapid bullets fired around here. [Indiscernible] deepwater and the onshore give me a chance to talk about the Highlander well produced in that the Highlander well which you haven\u2019t been -- we haven\u2019t talked about much in the detail [indiscernible] situation [indiscernible] 28,500 feet is the largest well that\u2019s ever been completed since [indiscernible] if you remember was [indiscernible] and it was such a big part of the Exxon Mobil transaction [audio-gap] 100 million a day [indiscernible] like to move [indiscernible] and the reason why that\u2019s important law low[indiscernible] that can use [indiscernible] and that well probably and some of the wells are producing over 250 BCF and projection production 400 BCF. So we\u2019ve been have a wells for similar to the low [indiscernible] resivor and the structure is [indiscernible] and we are from 30 to 60,000 [indiscernible]. So we have been [indiscernible] 5 years becoming experts at deep drilling and the deep potential and it\u2019s old trend from 200 miles away is [indiscernible] how that put spotted over it. [indiscernible] export terminal is [indiscernible] projects they don\u2019t have to have 5 to 700 million cubic feet of gas per day. [indiscernible] in exploration for gas because more the gas price [indiscernible] exploration. They look up and see the other half 5 to 700 million cubic [indiscernible] per day. And the time when we drill the discovery of 125 million in 1981 and also [indiscernible] had a the reasons on that gulf and [indiscernible] and they were having to provide a contracts with the help of Florida gas. But 300 million a day and they wouldn\u2019t have pay for [indiscernible] the well we drill offset was deregulated natural gas. We sell the gas for $9 NCF. So just to tell you that [indiscernible] have a funny way of turning on you and people make [indiscernible] from image to be able to deliver gas like with your export gas or L&G. [indiscernible] these toward looking the 5 to 700 million cubic gas a day. You better know [indiscernible] Operator : Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Again coming back to the questions around the CapEx, I think a lot of us are still having trouble understanding what the rationality is for increasing your base case CapEx for the oil and gas business by $1.6 billion. [Audio Gap] Thank you. Jim Flores : Again [indiscernible] its timing. The aspect [Audio Gap] of delaying the completions, we increase the CapEx for couple of reasons. I\u2019ll talk about that first of all. The discovery at [indiscernible] the additional drilling there the acceleration of offset exploitation projects like deep [indiscernible] by the operator. Obviously we are going to participate in because of the lowest nature of it and the de-risking by the [indiscernible] as well. Also when we drill our [indiscernible] West we risk them at 25% success or whether it success we have to complete it. We have to add capital in for that. We\u2019ve also taken a delivery of an additional shift called the [indiscernible] relentless here in the later third quarter to drill some development wells around the foreign mountain area to further like our operation to more efficient. We have to shut that platform in for the facility modifications. Those sides of things are making our operation more efficient and they can reservoir the placement more achievable and [indiscernible] of the long-term. You are not seeing it in the first 3 years with dynamic production growth because we are delaying a lot of the completion dollar for those projects because a budget concerns. So the whole exercise on page 23 that everybody struggling with is that if we would spend the money to complete the wells and earlier than what we plan our current plan and we have the capital to do it. We would see those production adjustments in 2017 as for the bottom part of page 23 versus the current plan we have on the top part of the page. Strictly production timing issue and we\u2019re going to get back David [indiscernible] will have some information on 18, 19 and 20 where you\u2019ll see the rest of the production profile. So if we have the additional capital we\u2019re able to accelerate those [indiscernible] not to drilling, not to risk and so forth of drilling wells is strictly hooking them up and the capital involve there then you\u2019ll see the production response within the three year period. But then on the current plan that we have that\u2019s on the prudent finance plan of allocating capital reducing our CapEx company wide, we\u2019re taking a more measured approach bringing that capital forward. And if the Katanga curve and oil curve is correct if we\u2019re in $70 oil market in couple of years, it\u2019s going to be much more beneficial to delay that production coming on because of price going forward. So that\u2019s where the magic happens. That cleared up? Unidentified Analyst : It does to some extent but perhaps can you quantify this $1.6 billion, how much incremental production does that give you say in 2018 versus three months ago forecast? Richard Adkerson : There\u2019ll be another 30,000 barrels of that. Yes but that\u2019s not the story for you. Let\u2019s take the success we\u2019ve had in the Vito Basin area as an example. I mean we acquired an interest in this area that shows been working on a development plan. Together we show we drilled this Power Nap well that\u2019s had tremendous amount of new information about the geology in that area and it\u2019s a very positive well. It\u2019s leading us now to look to develop to drill another exploration type well called Deep Sleep which will provide us significant information which has been de-risked significantly and has the chance of identifying a huge structure there. The information that we get from Power Nap and Deep Sleep to change the whole idea about how to develop that Vito Basin area. In that case for developing that that\u2019s going to take a number of years because this is a case where we have to put in new production facilities. It\u2019s not tying back to these existing production facilities and so this has similarities to making decision for major mine developers. First have to understand the geology. You have to develop a \u2013 you have to come up with a development plan for it. That development plan takes a number of years to put in place so the [indiscernible] that has been added to capital expenditures because of the success at Power Nap and Vito Basin area is going to lead us to spend some more capital to understand what we have, how it should be developed and make decisions on development and so that production is not going to come [indiscernible] for a number of years. Jim Flores : That\u2019s illustrated on Page 22 and 2019 is when Vito area starts producing in 2020 and so that\u2019s going on very fast illustrates exactly what Richard just said. Richard Adkerson : And we still don\u2019t know because when we drill this Deep Sleep well that may provide us some new insights just to how to develop this whole area. So it\u2019s something that\u2019s unfolding. It takes time and it\u2019s not going to be a question like some of the hook ups that Jim was talking about that have production consequences much quicker, but this is a major-major development project that could be one of the biggest projects in the entire deepwater in the Gulf of Mexico. Jim Flores : Net a billion barrels for the company. Unidentified Analyst : And just one more question on CapEx, how much incremental CapEx should we assume will be spent on the smelter in Indonesia which I assume is not in your guidance here? Richard Adkerson : It\u2019s not something where capital would be spent of significance until post 2016 because of the permitting time and so forth with that. In order to give you a sense of that the \u2013 to think of the smelter project because we come up with an approach of expanding not necessarily expanding making a Bolton type addition to our existing smelter [indiscernible] with partner Mitsubishi being an expenditure on the order of $2 billion with working capital something maybe slightly more than that. And so our plans would be to obtain project type financing for majority of those cost and then there would be the underlying equity that would be funded by partnership structure which we would have the major part of, but we would have other partners coming in, we are negotiating that and so our share of that projects cost would be a portion of the underlying equity for the project financing for majority of that cost in that construction that would be started in late 2016 or in 2017. Unidentified Analyst : Okay and Rio would be responsible for their kind of proportionate share of that as well currently? Richard Adkerson : Rio I\u2019m not sure if they don\u2019t call knows it Rio is our partner now and their interest in [indiscernible]steps up to 40% both 2021 and so they would have an interest in seeing that we come up with an arrangement for with the government for extending beyond 2021. We are in discussions, we have a great partnership with Rio and we are talking with them about how best to proceed. We don\u2019t have an agreement on that now. But I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll get a one that will be good for all of us. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. But it sounds like you are suggesting that we should not assume that Rio is planning to fund 40% of it or my misunderstanding? Richard Adkerson : Mitsubishi\u2019s potential partner there is other potential partners out there, you shouldn\u2019t assume that we\u2019re going to fund 60% of it. So we\u2019re at the stage right now working with Japanese construction firm, own construction contract. We are working with the land owner which is in Jason fertilizer operator where we have an additional deal with own land ownership rights and Sophia [indiscernible] up take, we are working to permitting. So there is a lot of work to be going forward. Let\u2019s go back to your original question about capital spending. We\u2019re not looking at $2 billion of capital coming to Freeport. We are looking at a smaller amount coming in over years in the future and we\u2019ll update you as we go forward in getting the details instruction of this project completed. Jim Bob Moffett : Let me just make sure that you understand. The change in the export [projected] price last year when no more permission given [indiscernible] for the [indiscernible] et cetera. What is main this is comment. It\u2019s not [indiscernible] it is export. [indiscernible] I mean if you can\u2019t take all from the Indonesia and putting it back to [indiscernible] so that means the Japanese are sitting there with their smelters with no fig. so this is not just a problem for the exporter the matter if the problem is discovered, the complete restructuring of the market. In other words to make is simple everybody assume that this is [indiscernible] and then for 100 years in Japan and other places [indiscernible] with archeology expert without [indiscernible] contract to work and for this negotiation you still [indiscernible] so the smelters don\u2019t have a slam dunk. [indiscernible] we just don\u2019t [indiscernible] there is a problem. [indiscernible] has no minerals on it and yet it has the downstream part of business. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s still [indiscernible] there is going to be fun work because this is not just one guy caught in [hot fire] everybody got the same problem. It\u2019s complete restructuring of how the business is done. Train to concentrate and the smelter. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Paretosh Misra from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Paretosh Misra : I had two questions I could ask but one is based on your conversation with the government so far, do you get the sense that they are open to renew your contract sooner than 2019 as long as there is an agreement on other issues like that [indiscernible]? Richard Adkerson : Yes that\u2019s our mutual objective and we are working towards that and the issue is and you know we are working on that happening this year sooner this year than later and the government officials working on recognize that as well. Paretosh Misra : And out of the total CapEx this year, how much are you spending at Grasberg including sustained CapEx? Richard Adkerson : Around 600 million. Kathy Quirk : The underground capital is in the $800 million range and sustaining is in the few $100 million range. Paretosh Misra : And actually just one last one. I know you\u2019ve given in the past your some sort of guidance for the cash cost at Grasberg when you built completely underground, can you just remind us what that number is? Kathy Quirk : Yes well the guidance we\u2019ve given is based on getting the full capacity, so in the earlier years as we\u2019re ramping up it will be higher, but at current oil prices we continue to expect that Grasberg underground will be the lowest cost portfolio and certainly less than $0.50 a pound. So we\u2019re not seeing here it changes in the open pit cost versus underground because of the nature of underground mining and the absence of stripping, so we\u2019ve got a very good cost structure, large scale it will be similar to the track record you\u2019re seeing with Grasberg over the years. Richard Adkerson : With all of this noise that we\u2019ve had to deal with for the past several years we \u2013 none of us here lose sight of just what a fabulous ore body this is. I mean it\u2019s really special in terms of the copper grades and gold grades that you have available through us. The ability to operate large scale block caving operations is spectacular. We\u2019re moving towards having a 250,000 tonne per day concentrator mill filled totally by underground operations and that\u2019s unique in this industry and we\u2019ve shown that we can operate Block Cave scales. Freeport\u2019s been block caving there since early 1980s and our DOZ mine and its predecessors that shallower elevations had years of successful operations, so we have the kind of ore the kind of host rock that allows us to operate at a truly world leading scale to get to this high grade ore and the rates of return on this project are spectacular. Jim Bob Moffett : This is Jim Bob again [indiscernible] open pit and in open pit you have [indiscernible] because you can\u2019t just make [indiscernible] underground. When [indiscernible] block caving [indiscernible] surround your ore [indiscernible] Block Cave [indiscernible] Block Cave. You don\u2019t have to do it other ways, so imagine [indiscernible] open pit [indiscernible] with all these [indiscernible] right around [indiscernible] to just sit there and scratch the bottom of this Block Cave [indiscernible] first blast and then [indiscernible] and find a place to put it [indiscernible] enormous part of our [indiscernible] but that\u2019s because you have to build [indiscernible] when you look at that [indiscernible] all that has been there [indiscernible] copper and gold and silver [indiscernible] so that\u2019s why we have the change. It sounds like 100 million people historically thought underground was [indiscernible] changes the whole impression of [indiscernible] but remember you\u2019re operating underground [indiscernible]. Richard Adkerson : And for the industry as a whole underground mining is a lot more expensive, but that\u2019s a unique characteristic of this [indiscernible] ore body is that we are able to mine such large volumes of high grade ore and reduce that unit cost down to depending on diesel fuel and so forth the levels that are and the price of gold levels that are consistent with our historical price cost levels there so, it\u2019s great asset. Listen we appreciate everybody\u2019s participation in I think a record setting length of a conference call, but we had a lot to talk about today. We want to make sure that in the context of these commodity markets and the changes in our plans that you understood what our assets are that we have to work with, what options we have to do, how we\u2019re approaching it. We\u2019re going to have as I said our fingers on all aspects of the markets for commodities and markets for capital that are available to us and we\u2019re going to find the right alternative to go forward and achieve our strategic objectives. Bring value out of these assets being alone. Richard Adkerson : [Indiscernible] talk about [indiscernible] properties. Jim Flores : All right everyone thanks and follow up questions [indiscernible] is available to be the point guy and we\u2019ll get people to answer them for you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the call. In addition to analysts and investors the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments we'd like to remind everyone that today\u2019s press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. On the call today is Jim Bob Moffett, Chairman of the Board; Richard Adkerson, Vice-Chairman and CEO of FCX; Jim Flores, Vice-Chairman and CEO of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas; and we also have several others from our senior operating and financial team in the room today. I\u2019ll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who will start with the presentation material included in our website presentation. As usual after our prepared remarks we\u2019ll open up the call for questions. Today FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $1.85 billion which was a $1.78 per share for the second quarter of 2015.  The net loss attributable to common stock included net charges totaling $2 billion or $0.92 per share for the second quarter primarily for the reduction of carrying values of oil and gas properties. After adjusting for these special items, FCX's adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $143 million or $0.14 per share. Copper sales during the second quarter totaled \u00a3964 million, we sold gold of 352,000 ounces and our oil and gas sales totaled 13.1 million barrels of oil equivalent. In the second quarter we realized an average copper price of 271 per pound that was below last year second quarter of 316 per pound. Gold prices of 11.74 per ounce compared with the prior year quarter of 12.96 per ounce. And our average realized price for crude oil during the second quarter of 2015 was 67.61 per barrel which included 11.79 per barrel as realized cash gains on our derivative contract. We generated operating cash flows of 1.1 billion during the quarter and our capital expenditures totaled 1.7 billion. We ended the quarter with 20.9 billion of consolidated debt and consolidated cash, which was just under $500 million. We also ended the quarter with availability under our revolver of approximately $3 billion and under the severity Cerro Verde project loan of just over $500 million. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Richard who will provide additional details on our results on operations and outlook. Richard Adkerson : Thanks Kathleen and good morning everyone. Thank you for participating in our call. I want to report on the operating and cost performance highlight of our second quarter and the first half of the year, of course in the context of a weak commodity price environment. But we have positive things to report. Our Morenci project, which is an important project for us is operating at flow of rates. Our Cerro Verde project in Peru is progressing very well, it's now more than 87% complete inline to a start up later this year and we're very pleased with the progress there. We have had improved operations at Grasberg, our mining rate, our recoveries, we\u2019re moving towards having access to higher grade ores in late 2015 and 2016, 2017 as we complete mining in the open pit. Our labor situation is stable during the second quarter. So from a mining standpoint, we are positioned near term growth and production and also to get the benefits financially of declining costs and declining capital expenditures as we complete our expansion projects. We had a good operating quarter in oil and gas business and Jim will be talking about in a few minutes. The Lucius production reached full capacity. We had positive drilling results with our Canyon projects for our hosting and horn mounting facilities. We now have seven top-ac wells available for completion that will provide incremental production volumes in future years. We previously reported that on June 23, we filed a registration statement on form S1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for potential initial public offering of minority interest in oil and gas subsidiary. I\u2019ll just point out we are in registration so we have some limitations on what we can say today, but we can report on our results in and our plans for our operations as we go forward. Kathleen reviewed the financial highlights and you can see that across the board our actual results were consistent with our guidance. We did, we are able to access some hard grade gold, Grasberg so our gold production was up roughly 15%. Our cost performance was good with our net cash operating costs in our mining business be in $1.50 per pound and $19 per barrel in the oil and gas business. So again if you look at our financial highlights it reflects a strong quarter operationally. Our company remains highly impacted by copper prices of course and highly leveraged to the copper prices and copper prices have dropped here late in the second quarter as we have gone into the third quarter. And copper is of course the commodity that\u2019s probably most effective by globally economic conditions in the current uncertainties there, the stronger dollar have contributed to the current price situation. The slowdown in the China economy is the factor and the carry on effects of the drop in stock prices in China and the impact on financial investors is certainly being shown in the copper price. Within China we do our business there, we see requirements for copper growing in absolute terms since China continuing to be a significant consumer of copper and with the countries commitment to infrastructure investment with the government's commitment to addressing the economic slowdown, we don't see China having a hard landing type situation in the summer predicting, but we have to be prepared to deal with the conditions as they evolve and we certainly will be do that as we have shown our ability to do in the past. As we talk with our customers our downstream customers in the U.S. and of course we are very significant supplier of copper in the U.S. We see recovery continuing at moderate rates and our customers being well positioned and confident about the outlook for the second half of this year, a gradual recovery Europe. So, as we have been for sometime we are facing near term price uncertainty in copper business and having to address our business in light of that uncertainty, you can develop reasonable scenarios now for prices either staying where they are dropping or increasing, but none of that deters us from our long range positive view of the long term fundamentals about the copper business. On the supply side, that minor phase continue to be constrained, inventory levels while they arose in the first quarter of 2015 remain modest by historical levels and our company is strongly positioned with our large volumes of copper production and very large inventory of reserves and resources to take advantage of what we remain confident will be a long term positive future for the copper business. Just to give view something that I have shown some of you before but just to illustrate that in broad terms on Slide 6, we show the largest copper mines in the world in terms of reserves on the left chart and in 2014 on the right chart. There is a limited number of mines here, the top 10 copper producing mines in 2014, produced less than 5 million tons per year. Another factor when we think about supply situation in the copper business there are 16 mines on these two charts. Only four of them were discovered in the last 50 years. The discovery of world class copper mines is very rare. They lasts for decades and these mines provide growth opportunities as you go forward, but it is a commodity of where the expectations or the likelihood of discovery of a new mine of world class significance is something that is rare. And then we look at the longer term copper market fundamentals, we used some WoodMackenzie data here. Other analysts use other data, some are more optimistic, some are less, but in WoodMackenzie analysis if you assume global growth at 2.4% a year for the next two years, which is not an aggressive view and that would include Chinese growth for the next 10 years, that would include Chinese growth at 3.7% where as China is growing at roughly 10% for the past 10 years you would see a requirement for copper $7.6 million ton. Over the same period production from existing mines will decline its grades drop and as mines move underground and the expectations WoodMackenzie is that would create an incremental requirement of 2.8 million ton. So when you look at growth at those levels declining production from existing mines, there is over the next 10 years at 10.4 million ton short falling copper that would need to be made up by expansions new projects or scrap and as I mentioned, the top 10 mines only produced 5 million tons last year. So that\u2019s just an indication of a longer term needs of the world for copper and when we leave our companies well positioned benefit from that and we are focused on it. Slide 8 shows our unit cost situations. You can see that we were consistent in achieving our objectives. Our consolidated net costs was a $1.50 pound showing some benefit of the incremental gold in Grasberg, which has had net unit cost of $0.81 a pound Tenke Fungurume in Africa is performing well approximately a $1 a pound cost and our North American operations are performing well. You can see the production from our mines by region on the bottom part of this chart the growth in North America reflects the ramp up of marine sea and it is up 40% from last year with our expansion capacity South America reflects the sale of Candle area, which is in the last year's numbers and not in this year's numbers. And our third where we felt short of it\u2019s production this year for operational reasons, but overall a good quarter. Slide 9, looks at our three major expansion projects that we targeted in 2010 following the financial crisis.  We reviewed our portfolio and identified three major projects to pursue Tenke Fungurume in Phase II expansion was started in the second quarter of 2011 it was completed in 2013. Meeting our target for capital expenditures and incremental copper. The marine sea project and the mill expansion mine expansion there was completed last year it is completed performed well now Cerro Verde is approaching completion. In total these three projects will add roughly a billion pounds of copper production for us and involves a total of aggregate of expenditures of just over $7 billion very proud of our project management team and operations teams for effectively executing these projects. At Cerro Verde, which is a world-class project make it a world-class mine the detailed engineering in major procurement is complete. On completion this will be the mine with the world\u2019s largest concentrating facilities 360,000 tons a day which is massive and impressive. Construction is advancing own schedule that\u2019s more than 87% complete we\u2019re preparing to gain commissioning getting videos daily pieces of equipment beginning to operate our team there is very excited and highly motivated we\u2019ve been able to work closely with the community in doing this project. And we\u2019ve had a minimal interruptions from our labor and virtually not from community standpoint adding 600 million pounds of copper per year. We will expect to complete this on our capital budget to-date we\u2019ve incurred about $4 billion and committed for more than that, but it\u2019s going very well. Slide 11, shows our growing copper production profile for the remaining of remainder of 2015 and what we\u2019re looking for in 2016 we will be having increase in production as we go forward into the second half of 2015. So here we\u2019ve been working for a number of years to benefit from these projects by giving us higher volumes and what we\u2019ll call us and that\u2019s what we\u2019re achieving and you can see as we go forward the impact of that using today\u2019s cost levels of declining unit cost for our company and also declining capital expenditures as we go forward. The important area of attention for our company has been working with the government of Indonesia in terms of securing mutually acceptable agreement on long-term operating rights. We have in place a contract of work our second contract that we signed in Indonesia, but it was a contract that signed in 1991 that had a 30 year primary term extending to 2021 and by it\u2019s terms giving us a rights to two 10 year extensions beyond that in a quarter with the terms of that contract. That contract provides us the necessary, legal and physical assurance that gives us the confidence to be able to make the long-term capital investments and we\u2019re investing $15 billion to develop our underground resources to replace the open pit reserves is just depleted. This extension requires approval by the government of Indonesia, but under the contract that cannot be unreasonably withheld. We\u2019ve had discussions now for a number of months with the government on how the deal with our contractual lights with new mining laws and regulations that has been adopted in the country of Indonesia and what we\u2019ve worked together with the government to do is to find a mutually satisfactory solution that provides our shareholders the confidence they need for us to continue to make an investments and also be responsive to the aspirations of the government of Indonesia and the new mining law regime. The rights under our contracts currently continue until we agree to find a way forward, which may provide may involve some limits to it as part of our efforts to be responses to the government we\u2019re working on developing new smelting capacity in Indonesia and we\u2019ve made significant progress in terms of identifying sites and partnership arrangements and contract arrangements for that project that would be impair well with our resolution of our COW situation. We have submitted our application for renewal for export license for the next six months and we were making progress with the government in securing that. We do have a long-term record that goes back 40 years now of working successfully in Indonesia and a positive way to partnership with a government and local community. Our operations have been the primary economic driver for development in problem we want to continue to contribute to that and be part of that as well as providing significant overall benefits to the Indonesia economy direct benefits have been $18 billion over the past seven years and the split of those benefits have been 60% for the government, 40% for Freeport. Our Chairman Jim Bob Moffett, has been in Indonesia directly involved in discussions with government officials he is there no. And Jim Bob I would like to turn the call over to you to make whatever comments you like to make. Jim Bob Moffett : I will make some comments in Q&A but as you said as we\u2019re making good progress and straight to good excellent guys and respect to duty timing certainly grew directionally continue as mentioned Joe, which we follow usually managing for. The primary term for 2021 and 2022 extension, so I\u2019m here to make sure this rise since we are talking about 2041 been important time, because in that present time we\u2019ll be finishing maybe now operating and you wanted to open to it now bring those mines going on production. It becomes the largest underground mine in the world and as you have seen we continue engineering which has been in problems. So as you\u2019ve seen from the break actually things we measure the mines and then we made it actually I\u2019ll be thinking on rep and we hope it\u2019s included in next several areas. Thank you Rick and I\u2019m further see in Q&A. Richard Adkerson : All right thanks Jim Bob. Turning to Slide 13, operationally we've completed development of access to these underground ore bodies, which includes the deep MLZ zone, which is an extensions of our existing producing underground mine and the development of the Grasberg blockade, which lies underneath the pit and we expect the deep MLZ to start up late this year and so schedule that and Grasberg blockade to now begin production in 2018. The key development activities have been involved with overflow systems and Grasberg blockade shaft development capital to-date is total $3.3 billion, $2.6 billion net to PT Freeport Indonesia after Rio Tinto\u2019s participation and our share of underground mine developments is expected to average $700 million a year over the next five years.  And you can see in the chart below when the deep MLZ comes downstream and then the Grasberg Block Cave both these mines have very significant positive grades of copper and gold as does the Grasberg open pit and we expect after we move into the underground 1.5 year large volumes of copper and gold with copper being in the range of 1.1 billion, 1.2 billion and gold 1.4 million to 1.5 million ounces annually from 2019 to 2022, 2018 to 2022. And now to conclude the opening part of our presentation I would like to focus on our really significant inventory resources on Slide 14. Our company has proved reserves that are based on mine plans of $2 copper of over \u00a3100 billion. In addition to that, we have mineralized material that is based on 220 copper of an incremental \u00a3100 billion and beyond that we have identified additional resource potential at our existing mines. These are not greenfield projects but places where we already have infrastructure footprint operations of another \u00a3170 million.  So, we have, as far as we can see in the future opportunities to invest in growth projects when the markets wants it, we\u2019re going to be very prudent about doing that what we can do it in low risk basis and use our track record of successfully doing projects in a consistent way. When those opportunities warrant themselves and we are working diligently on looking at the next phase of growth projects as we look forward. With that, Jim Flores is here to talk about oil and gas business. Jim Flores : Thanks Richard and good morning everyone. I'm on Page 15 of second quarter 2015 oil and gas highlights. Couple of comments. We\u2019ve had a excellent quarter operationally both on the operating side but also on the financial side getting the S1 filed for our potential IPO later this year and that will guide lot of the restrictions on the comments I\u2019ll be able to make today. But from the operation standpoint, we focused on low risk drilling and Tieback opportunities. As stated here on Page 15, we\u2019ve been 10 for 10 as very successful wells since 2014. This has help to tie in all of our seismic and all the resources that we capture over the last couple of years in the lease sales and also acquisitions. And now we are enjoying bearing the fruits of all that labor. We\u2019ve placed three wells of production in 2014 and first half of '15 that really impacts production you see. Oil production increased in the second quarter over first quarter because of that activity. We also cash operating margin has increased mainly due to prices and also lower production cost and we see our production cost of 20.26 a barrel down to 19.04. That trend is going to continue as we continue to add volumes to our fixed infrastructure and our fixed cost structure out there. And when you look at the economics of our business, it\u2019s worth noting here, that is one of the key metrics when you look at our cash operating margin which is one the industry leading cash operating margin from the standpoint because our cost structure is low but also kind of continue to trend lower. We\u2019re forecasting $19 to $12 on our alloys over the next four to five years as we continue to ramp up production here and our corporate costs are up $4. We\u2019re probably going to cut those in half.  So, when you look at that our cash margin has got real opportunity to grow by controlling on the cost side and even in this low price environment from there with our DDNA rate now around $26 and going forward our F&D cost below $25 a barrel. We\u2019re basically going to build and earn some money even if this $50 oil price. It is going to be much better than 60.65, we are tuning our business for the lower oil prices but as long as it takes before the adjust back to more normalized levels. Back to the drilling, we continue to get success in a lot of tieback wells going forward to the next 12 months to 2017 and what the investors will get a vision of is as we have we call upon the success is exactly what the timing of that production is coming on. And the aspects of build models is for the value being created with the drill bit here is quite special. But news is coming for rates been very successful project operated by Anadarko, we have the sister project Hollow Berg coming on mid-2016 it\u2019s on schedule and actually the facility is in place and secured. We\u2019ve had a successful well with end of Vito basin, which is our Power Nap well and we\u2019ve already spotted an offset opportunity called deep slip that we have high hopes for as well. Slide 16, the subsea development tie back strategy that\u2019s going to drive a lot of value for our company our investors is off to a great start across the board. And our 100% owned Holstein wall, Horn Mountain, facilities we\u2019ve actually drilled and completed well in each area or couple of wells in each area and tie back wells in to Marlin and also Horn Mountain. And we also, but we have the big Holstein deep development that we every time back next year in 2016. Over the next two years as we put bring this well along it\u2019s going to require some downtime in each facility in our few weeks whatever to come up and so it will be actually be the following six to 12 months after that you\u2019ll see full production response without any platform interruptions to get all the success churns of the tanks. And a big thing about our strategy in the deep water that makes us so unique is the timing of these tie backs the cycle time. We\u2019re making discoveries and having full production wells come on like in Dorado three months paid 17 OCG 12 to 18 months and King 9 to 12 months this will accelerate going forward as we get the initial subsea infrastructure place as we had wells and floor lies to the subsea connections, which is much easier to been trying to bring them all with back to platform. So we\u2019re also running the teams who are all doing great and we\u2019ve overcome any kind of obstacles or challenges so forth and we look like we have some bulls guy he had is force doing something to a more repetitive basis and take some of the risk out of the situation. In Page 18, Lucius we talked about was great discovery made 2009 it\u2019s up 80,000 barrels a day and about it\u2019s like to processing for to May maybe fill the gas, but about a 100 of that\u2019s ours that we have an interest in.  And to six Sub Sea wells one depth of the 7200 feet is a real really pushing the more depth out there and it\u2019s just been a fantastic project on time and at cost. And our of our project it seems to be going just the same it\u2019s moved forward a lot of fund Lucius to help this Hollow Berg and so forth and we have a smaller as I said 2.5% but still significant for our 2016 volumes. We open Page 19, and it kind of showed a near-term growth in 2015, 2016, 2017 from the capital budget we have now production growth is going to be important but muted and from 1.3, 1.51, 1.73, because of timing of spending to accelerate the production and wells we\u2019ve already drilled and that\u2019s one way we\u2019ll double to lay CapEx during this low price environment manage our business. We\u2019ve been following S1 for the IPO if we raise capital in IPO to accelerate our business then when you look at the higher numbers of 143, 175, and 215, as potential \u2013 potential ForEx as we put on wells faster and we\u2019ve already drilled this year and next. When you look at page 20, it\u2019s kind of it\u2019s subs of 70 of what prices do at various production rates you can plug in whatever you want you model that where this our cash flows live and so forth. But this we\u2019re obviously planning on our side operation at the low end and on in the rest of the company is hoping for the high end. So you can look at that you could see they\u2019re growing the volumes does matter it would drop right to the bottom line and it\u2019s going to be a very significant part of our business is getting those lines up to 225. Part of copying sustaining that or increasing that from that 225 well was at our Valley area we entered the space and post the detail discovery with an 18.67% interest and the detail and we certainly grow the power in that discovery with the 50% working interest we\u2019re very, very excited about that and that we\u2019re drilling the other side of the basin where deep slip as well as well and we should be down sometime this quarter and hope to be in gain results from that going forward. On page 22, you can see kind of the pipeline we have built of we think are very strong set of projects that we own that are going to move the needle here to company so you can build and keep track of how we\u2019re doing and what projects going forward. Hope to keep the success rate up and drive the size going forward. Richard turn it back to you on Page 23. Richard Adkerson : Thanks Jim. Just to update our 2015 outlook our copper sales outlook is the same as last quarter at 4.2 billion pounds, gold at 1.3 million ounces for the year and molybdenum down couple of million pounds. And with oil equivalents of 52.3 million barrels 67% crude oil. And our unit cost per copper is not changing a $1.53 a pound that will depend on any number of factors including byproduct pricing of which is built into here at 11.50 gold and $6 molybdenum for the rest of the year. And oil at $19 that would model out with operating cash flows at 250 copper or for $3.6 billion each $0.10 change in copper for the remainder of the year is a $190 million. Capital expenditures have been reduced by a couple of hundred million dollars as we got some capital in our mining business to $6.3 billion for the year. Our sales profile looking beyond the current year you can see the growth in 2016 and 2017 both from our expansion projects, but also from the high grade that we will be having with our mine plan Grasberg you can see that in the gold sales going to 1.9 million ounces and 2.4 million ounces in 2016 and 2017. On a quarterly basis on slide 25 as I mentioned earlier we\u2019ll be having higher volumes of copper in the second half of the year strong gold quarters as we take advantage of the grace available to it\u2019s Grasberg and you can see our outlook quarterly for our oil and gas business our molybdenum business. Slide 26, gives the details of our net unit production cost, which consolidates $1.53 but you can see the strong numbers in Indonesia and Africa and really strong numbers in the Americas as well. And you can see our sales volumes at the bottom. On the consolidated basis and looking at cash flows we have shown here averages for 2016 and 2017 and showing copper prices ranging from 250 to 350 and EBITDA numbers at 250 copper of $8.5 billion and $11 billion and $3 billion and then with operating cash flows, which would take into account cash taxes, cash interest excluding working capital changes so $6.5 billion for 215, $8.3 million for 350 for $3. Sensitivity for that are shown or adjusting that as you see that on page 28, and then our capital expenditures are shown on page 29, you can see capital expenditures declining this year from last year and will decline further as we go forward with basically part of level of spending under this plan for our oil and gas business and robbing CapEx in our mining business is complete on making projects. Our Board is committed to balance sheet management and we got a strong track record of doing that both in good times and times with weak commodity prices we\u2019re able to do this because of our large resource base. The cash flows that it generates in our capital discipline. We have and we\u2019ll continue to take steps to reduce costs and CapEx look for opportunities to bring values forward through asset sales of course we have suspended our common stock dividend look forward to the time we can store that and company is committed to returning cash to shareholders. But increasing volume declining CapEx will enhance our credit metrics even in low commodity price environments. We\u2019ve talked about looking for external funding in the oil and gas business due to this IPO that we\u2019ll be considering that has to go through an SEC review process, which we\u2019re making progress with now then give us the opportunity to look to go to markets here in the second half of the year and for other opportunities that might be there as well, we have $3 billion liquidity and as the extra revolving $0.5 billion facility our total debt at the end of the quarter was $20.9 billion with $500 million of cash as I said we looking forward to improving credit metrics. In conclusion our three priorities are going to be focused in this kind of commodity price environment on protecting our balance sheet, we do that by managing operation in CapEx to maximize cash flows we\u2019re looking for oil and gas funding to take advantage of these near term growth opportunities as Jim talked about completing, we are totally focused on completing our Sierrita project and taking advantage of our expanded operations in Morenci and Tenke Fungurume and generating values in the long run from our large resource base so execution, execution, execution, execution is our focus during this challenging market conditions. With that, we would like to open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. David Gagliano : Thank you for taking my questions. My first question given the decline across the board in pricing, I'm wondering are you considering additional asset sales in this environment in addition to the energy IPO? Richard Adkerson : Well we are looking at all alternatives. Assets sales is potentially one, other alternatives will be dialing back some of our operations to reflect the economics of the current environment. For example we are doing that in our molybdenum business were prices are week. We benefit in that marketplace because of our really strong position. 80% of the market right might or the chemical business to focus on that were realization are higher but we may limit molybdenum production in some of our bio product operations in response to prices. In 2008 we curtailed production at high cost mines to reduce cost and we\u2019re looking at that. Presently all of our mines are positive cash flow generators but if markets deteriorate further we\u2019re prepared to take steps to be responsive to that. So Dave we\u2019re looking across the board at opportunities, asset sales in the mining business are possibility the markets not great as you can see from recent transactions and with our long term positive view at marketplace that will be taken into account. But all things like that are on the table and under considerations. David Gagliano : That's helpful. On Indonesia, it's a two-part question. First of all, on the export permit, can you talk us through in the event that it's not renewed, what does happen there given what's happened previously? And then the second part of the question any other dates that we need to be thinking about for Indonesia? I thought that was a labor contract coming due at some point in 2015, that\u2019s it. Richard Adkerson : All right. Let me start with the labor contract. In Indonesia we have to negotiate new labor contracts every two years that's by law. And so we do have our existing contract expiring and the second half and third quarter and so we are engaged in negotiations with the union now and all reports of those negotiations are going well and we expect to get that contract renewed as we did with our last contract. And actually as I mentioned labor relations at our operations are really good right now are positive. With the export permit we expect that to be renewed. We met the requirements of the government and the - and then we\u2019re going through the process of working with the government to get that done as we speak so we expect to get it renewed. It is important to us at the present time without the export permit, of course to be an export and right now the PT smelting, smelter at graphic has faced an operation less user requiring some repairs and is currently shut down. So it is important us to get this export permit. We believe we got a process going that allow us to do that. It\u2019s not in anybody\u2019s interests, government communities, workers, of course our shareholders but that's not to be renewed, expected to be renewed. David Gagliano : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Tony Rizzuto : Thanks very much. Hi everyone. I wanted to also focus on the cash burn just to follow up on Dave's question a little bit. I was very pleased to hear you Richard mentioned about throttling back possibly in the production side and asset sales as well. Do you have any further flexibility in terms of capital spending and also what about the possible equity issuances beyond oil and gas IPO? How would you view those other options or are the options? Richard Adkerson : Well, as I said all auctions were on the table, none of us, want to sell equity at this stock price, I mean you know that\u2019s not something that any of us as shareholders and as you know we are all shareholders would want to do. Hopefully the board is going to protect the balance sheet so we are going to look at all options and see what we might need to do that. As we look forward in running our business, we are going to be prepared to be add to be consistent with what the market brings to us. So if in fact prices do deteriorate, we have flexibility in our business because certain costs both in the mining and in the oil and gas business and we will have contingency plans that allow us to do that. So we are optimistic about markets longer run prepared to deal with short runs uncertainty, prepared to bridge our business if we have to do it and operationally we have the capability to doing in it, and Tony I know I don\u2019t need to remind you just how effective we were in doing that in 2008 and 2009. Tony Rizzuto : I think that would be well received if that was possibly joined in terms of efforts to throttle back on output because the market surplus at least what the consultants are saying right now might not be that much out of whack and if there were some movement sooner rather than later it might help the market from getting too far out of whack. I think that would be well received. The other question I had was on Indonesia and there some reports have indicated recently that you guys have agreed to a transition from a COW to a special mining license and I guess first of these reports accurate? If you could help us understand what the main differences might be between the COW and the special mining license, what the new license arrangement wouldn't afford you similar levels of protection or might it be more subject to more frequent changes? Is there anything you can comment on at this point? Richard Adkerson : There has been a wide range of options that been discussed with the government and different ideas have been raised for consideration at different times. There has not been a decision to convert from the contract to a mining license if that were to be done and I\u2019m not suggesting that its likely but that were to be done we would have, it would be done on the basis of having an accompanying contract that would give us the kind of assurances on fiscal terms and legal terms that we would require. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re really focused on is how to we have a preservations of our rights to operate beyond the primary term by existing COW, it had a 20 year provision for continued operations and then to ensuring that the terms fiscally and legally that we have beyond the COW through an extension of the COW give us the degree of assurance. And we've indicated a degree of flexibility in working with government so long that's achievable. Achieving that within the framework of the existing laws and regulations in the country is complicated and probably the most straight forward way would be to find a way of reaching a mutual agreement on continuing the COW, but we've expressed that we would be flexible in dealing with that so long as we could achieve our fundamental objectives of assurance about operating rights, fiscal terms, legal enforceability for the long run. Tony Rizzuto : Is an additional sell down of the stake in PTFI, is that also part and parcel part of this, these discussions as well? Richard Adkerson : Absolutely, I mean, a year ago we signed a memorandum of understanding that covered six points that we indicated would be prepared to go forward with in conjunction, achieving the continued rights to operate with the assurance of terms that I just mentioned. And one of those is that we agreed that we would agree to sell an incremental interest in PTFI's equity to get up to a 30% Indonesian ownership. Right now the government owns 9.36%. We agreed to do that provided we had the extension of our contract and acceptable terms and that would be done at fair market value. But that was part of the memorandum of understanding that we've been had with the government now for roughly a year. Tony Rizzuto : Right, understood. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Gambardella : Yes, good morning Richard. Just a follow up question on Tony's, on Grasberg and the contract. Is it your understanding that or the Company's understanding that you will not go forward without some type of whether it's the COW, hybrid between the COW and the licensing agreement. But that one provision that you need is some certainty of operations through 2041? Richard Adkerson : Yes, that's right Mike. Because right now more than 75% of our reserves is going to be produced after 2021, and so these investments that we're making right now to develop the underground and we've agreed to develop smelting capacity, all of that is for the benefit of operations beyond 2021. So, we need to have that rights, those rights under acceptable terms to justify the investments that we've already made in the continued investments. And the government understands that and that's what we're are working to deal with. And the complication has been, how do you do that in the context of the current laws and regulations in Indonesia and how that interrelates to our contractual rights? But that's a necessary element. Michael Gambardella : I mean, what's the government's response when you tell them that your contract that you signed back in 1991, supersedes any changes in Indonesian government law? Richard Adkerson : There is an issue with the public perception of how the contract interact with the laws. The legal situation is clear cut, and so we have opted and I really believe this is the right answer, and our Board, Jim Bob fully supported is that we will be much better suited if we can find the way of dealing with this in a cooperative fashion that is responsive to the public opinion and aspirations of the government rather than just digging our heels and saying the contracts, contract. Mike, we've been through this before in other countries and other places, and so that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to achieve our objectives in a way that's cooperative, that preserves the partnership, and that is sensitive to government officials, who are subject to elections and in a democratic process they have to be sensitive to public opinion. Jim Bob Moffett : Mike, this is Jim Bob. Let me just comment on a couple of thing. As you've seen in the press in the last couple of days, the government has indicated that they're going to extend our contract and they're going to use [indiscernible] because as a matter of fact when the MOU expires at July 27, two days from now, the new COW is what becomes the controlling document. [Indiscernible] as you've seen in some of the government announcements, it basically says that we have not changed anything. And the reason that we are offsetting our current is before we make any kind of concessions or the government makes any kind of concessions we're trying to end up with a win-win situation and that's where this thing is headed. Michael Gambardella : One last question on Grasberg. On Slide 29 of your presentation today, where you talked about the CapEx for the Company going through 2017. I'm assuming that does not include any assumptions for new smelter in Indonesia, is that correct? Richard Adkerson : That's correct Mike. The new smelter would involve and aggregate investment of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, and we are working on a structure that would involve project financings for it, as we did with the smelter that we built in the mid 1990s and also the potential involvement of other partners in it, but that is not included in our CapEx numbers. The bulk of that CapEx will be spent beyond 2016, 2017, because we'll do substantial work between now and then, but a lot of that work would be done on site preparation, their substantial amount of reclamation of land and preparation of the building sites because this would be located in Eastern Java in the Gresik area, near our existing smelter and the fertilizer operations in Fertilizer Company. Michael Gambardella : From the estimated $2 billion to $2.5 billion cost, and then using as you said bringing in partners, project financing, how low can you get that down for report. Can you get it down to $0.5 billion? Richard Adkerson : Let me do some calculations in my head. I was going to just answer, as low as we can get it. I mean, we're going do it as low as we can get it. If we say - yeah, that could be in that range -- to be in that range. Now also not included Mike, is also the proceeds that would come to us from these divestments that we talked about. I mean, we're talking about a substantial value for just over 20% interest in PTFI, and that would occur over time but those proceeds are also not included in our outlook numbers. Michael Gambardella : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Yu with Citi. Please go ahead. Brian Yu : Thanks. Well, I also got a question on Indonesia. Richard, I think in the past you guys have laid out numbers about the financial benefits to Indonesia under the COW, and then under the new mining laws. And as you guys are going through the discussions, as we look at the possible financial impact, if you were switching to the new mining laws, is it still correct that financially there would not be material impact between royalties, tax rates, and other pieces to those? Richard Adkerson : Yes. Well, when they talk about going to the new mining law they are insisting that we continue with our current 35% income tax rate which is higher than the general income tax rate in Indonesia of 25%. Beginning last year we need to pay the higher royalties under the mining law to get the export ban out of the way, so the financial impact right now would be essentially the same that we've had under the COW. The issue for us is to fix these terms so that we would not be subject to imposing incremental taxes either by the duties, either by the central government or the provincial government. So, we now haven't been arguing about increasing fiscal terms for the government, we all kind of agree on that. The issue for us is okay, we agree to this, this is what we live with going forward and not be subject to potential imposition of new taxes roll over these duties and fees by the succeeding governments over a long-term. And when you look at our deal with Indonesia, where the government now gets 60% of the benefits, the financial benefits, that's stronger than kind of anywhere else in the world, by international standards this is a very positive deal for the government in Indonesia. Brian Yu : Okay. And second question maybe, switching topics, page 19, where you've outlined the potential growth on the energy aspects. So what's the incremental capital that would be required to get to 215,000 barrels per day? And then along those same lines I think, it was counted that you would do it only if the IPO is successful. Is there -- would you have to raise more the ones required to bridge the existing free cash flow short fall or is there some number that we can guide or you can guide us to, to figure out when you might go forward with more accelerated rate? Jim Flores : Brian, this is Jim. I think the question is one and the same, right? It's what the capital it's going to take to get to 215,000 [indiscernible] it's somewhere between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion depending on what and how we time everything of additional proceeds to get there. So if we don't hit 2015, and if we only raise $500 million, and we want to face in the spending and we want to hit 215,000in 2018, we can time that as well. So we got a lot of flexibility as to how much we raise and how much and how fast we spend it, but to support this plan is between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion. Brian Yu : Yes I think. So, if I understand correctly is the fund, let's say that the IPO order go through whatever funds that'll be raised would be targeted towards growing production not necessarily kind of bridging the existing free cash flow short fall, that correct? Jim Flores : Well, the aspects of that, it would allow us to spend that money earlier and get the production up and you would have a lot less free cash flow short fall with 215,000 to 225,000 barrels a day and therefore the free cash flow short fall be a lot smaller. Brian Yu : Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America Merill Lynch. Please go ahead. Oscar Cabrera : Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone. As you're saying, with oil and gas as we may, Jim you commented that you can get your operating cost in your oil and gas operations down for $12 BOE, what level of production would you need to get to those \u2013 that number? Jim Flores : About 250,000 barrels a day. And the key about that Oscar, is where that production comes from. Well, it comes up from our existing 100% oil platforms that has the highest or the most dramatic impact lowering the LOE cost. Obviously we\u2019re just doing division there with higher volumes versus the same cost structure and that's where we've focused all our dollars. Oscar Cabrera : Okay. And then got to ask a question on Grasberg. There is a comment on the -- on your press release that says that you may reduce further for investment activity. Any negotiations on the amendment of the contract of work? Would you just put context from that, would these be if there's no resolution by the July 25th deadline how are you thinking about this? Jim Flores : The comment is just a statement of fact that without resolution of the long-term situation we would be faced with discontinuing spending money for that long-term production needs. And so that's what we've been trying to avoid, that's not in our interest, our workforce interest, the local community's interest or the government's interest. So that's just a consequence of what would happen if we have a failure in getting this resolved. We believe we'll get it resolved as Jim Bob said, the government is saying we're going to get it resolved, so that's -- we believe that's what will happen. And so far we continue to progress our development activities based on our confidence that we'll get it resolved. Oscar Cabrera : Thanks for leveraging. Just one more thing, if I may. In your development topic, $3.3 billion, that increased a little bit from the previous quarter and some of the projects -- the development projects around the world, CapEx has been coming down, is there any reason for the increase, anything to do with the metallurgy or the something that's happening in the underground that increased in the CapEx there? Kathleen Quirk : Oscar, are you referring to $3.3 billion that was incurred today, what number are you referring to? Oscar Cabrera : This is the slide where you quote the amount of money that you're spending per year, so $700 million now, was $600 million last quarter. Kathleen Quirk : Yeah, There was some timing changes in some of the underground spend and it worked out from a rounding standpoint to get from $600 million to $700 million, but there was no material change in any of the plans. And the progress on the underground development continues to go very well and that's achieving what we have set out to achieve in terms of the development. But there has been no significant changes from last quarter, just some timing things that came into the five years and some rounding changes. Oscar Cabrera : Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead. John Tumazos : Thank you very much for the generous call and the length of the call and accepting my question. Concerning the Grasberg contract negotiations, is there any guidance concerning the proceeds from the government stepping up to 20% or FCX get any cash to make it down on the debt, or would that be financed by an earn out or a loan from FCX to the government? And secondly, could you talk a little bit about the $1.2 mining CapEx budgeted for projects for 2017, does that equal $0.7 million for Grasberg underground, and then where would the other pieces of it be? And thirdly, could you tell us what are the bigger bites in $2.9 billion oil and gas CapEx, say in 2017? Jim Flores : Okay, let\u2019s start with the questions in order that you raised. On divestiture, there is a process that is established in Indonesia, of where incremental interest would first be offered to the government as you suggested, it would not be all at onetime, but it would be done in steps. And any transaction John, with the government would be a cash transaction, where we will not be providing financing. If the government opts not to buy the shares itself and that may well occur, we have talked with the government about the possibility of having an IPO of PTFI shares on the Indonesian stock exchange. And that would be a standard IPO that would be syndicated and we would receive the cash proceeds from that. We've also talked about the possibility of having some interest not -- certainly not 20% interest, but some smaller piece of that perhaps going to the provincial government in some sort of trust form and we might drive some financing for that piece. Otherwise, other Indonesian investors might have an interest in doing and those would be on of cash business to business type basis. Kathleen Quirk : John it's Kathleen. The second part of your question regarding - Richard Adkerson : John is that covered? John Tumazos : That's very helpful. Thanks you. Kathleen Quirk : I was going to say on the CapEx, in addition to those underground development spend we also have couple $100 million for the smelter expansion at Miami and then we\u2019ve also got in our plans to commence the stripping for the Lone Star project which would extend the life of the Lone Star oxide which would extend the life of Stafford. So we\u2019ve got some stripping costs reflected in 2017 as well and those are the three major components of that number. John Tumazos : Thank you. Jim Flores : All right, John on the oil and gas side, this is Jim, you\u2019ve got to buy the 7 billion in Marlin and Horn Mountain, Holstein which is three key projects most of that\u2019s but half of Marlin in the second half split between Marlin Holstein. They spend about $300 million in California and about $650 million in the Vito basin and then a couple $100 million, $100 million which is another $90 million in our gas business. John Tumazos : Thank you. Jim Flores : And then you got a corporate allocation of about $220 million on top of that get, up to the 2.9. John Tumazos : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS. Please go ahead. Brian MacArthur : Hi good morning. Sorry to go back to Grasberg again. I have the same question John did. If you did understand if you did a provincial thing it might like to [indiscernible] was done in the past so that\u2019s the only piece that you would actually potentially provide financing and then the rest would just be either sell down to whoever either the government or someone else were add that timing we get cash in and if that didn\u2019t work, that\u2019s when you go to the public markets and just take whatever the valuation was at the time. Richard Adkerson : No, in this is still working progress Brian, but we and government officials for sometime have seen the benefit of the public market listing that would first of all Indonesia\u2019s stock exchange has developed into a active traded fair marketplace and we all see mutual benefits of having PTFI listed as an Indonesian company on that exchange provided we get a fair market value which you could in that marketplace. So we think that would probably be something that we would pursue with the government following the government\u2019s decision own its owned desires for investing in the shares itself. Brian MacArthur : Okay. So really the concept of just giving money to the provincial come out like probably very low on it, so you are really thinking about anyway you do it would be cash in the door, right away at the time. Richard Adkerson : For the bulk of what we\u2019re talking about if our community relation situation and again to be response aspirations of the province, we can see some benefits of working on a structured deal with the province. From that standpoint for our portion of this interest and but that all has to remained to be worked out. The province has indicated to us they might to provide third party financing for that. We and the central government want to ensure that if we do a deal with province its benefits the people, the province itself and not any third party investor so all of that has to be factored into the process. Brian MacArthur : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Steve Bristo with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Steve Bristo : Thanks. Did I hear Jim Bob right that you guys expect to reach an agreement on a contractor work and also those permits to the next couple of days? Jim Bob Moffett : That's exactly right. Let me just read you can look it up. It talks about the investment that we're going to be making and extending the contract for another 20years. This is probably for the minister. The minister cited said earlier the government of Indonesia does not have any intention to terminate the contract after 2021. The government we both have tried to get the agreement outlined here and if you go down to the next 2015, the Indonesian financed today which is Bloomberg announcement it says the administer once again for a point has a valid contract until 2021. The President said prepare for an investment that could. The answer is the reason why I'm trying to measure my words in negotiations is really hard on a call like this to talk about negotiations. But the answer is public statements are using what the government has done and you can verify that they want us to continue and we obviously have every reason to continue under proper terms.  The proper terms are going to be we need to get the terms continuously the contract whether you talk about a mining license or COW. We need to have that's why I'm staying here to make sure that we accomplish that. Steve Bristo : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Jeremy Sussman with Clarkson. Please go ahead. Jeremy Sussman : Yes, just going back to Slide 19 and whether or not you go through with the incremental, I think you said $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion in CapEx to potentially accelerate drilling. Is this more about how much money you might raise an IPO or more about where oil prices are accommodation of both? Jim Flores : Well, this would be - me and my team's third IPO. It's about to solicit funds and to attract investors they got to get return to that new capital coming in at door. So the aspect is going to have growth component but what we're basically able to do is accelerate putting this wells on and create more cash flow at the company warrant. I think the investors will have a positive look on the oil prices longer term with respective of whatever oil prices are at the time in the IPO. I mean its \u2013 sense lower \u2013 because higher feature and so the aspect of that is if you look at higher volumes and better prices, I mean by 2017 cash flow neutral is a reality. If you look at lower prices longer and higher volumes you\u2019re going to push out of 2018. So this really going to be how you look at the business and your view point going forward as far as what the investor appetite is. When it comes to size, we can sell up to 19.9% of the business and still achieve our objectives here at Freeport. So if we sell 8% of the business, 10%, 12%, 15% based on price and that amount of capital will regulate how our business will be on going forward to make sure we get into a cash neutral situation. Jeremy Sussman : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And just may be just fair potential update on timing of when you might look to do this? Jim Flores : We're still hoping this fall. Like Richard said it's up to be SEC. They've been going back and forth on our document and we're making progress there. So everything looks like it's on track to be available. Obviously market conditions will be something that we'll be watching. We're looking at this fall, I guess this is an answer. Jeremy Sussman : Great, thanks very much and good luck. Operator : We will now turn the call over to management for any closing remarks. Richard Adkerson : Well, thanks everyone for joining us today and we look forward to making progress in all the issues we talked about today. If you have further questions please contact David and he will that you get your answers. Thanks for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning, and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has also been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available later today on our website. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. Today on the call, we have Jim Bob Moffett, Richard Adkerson, Jim Flores and several other of our senior members of the team in the room here. I'll just start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who'll review our recent performance and outlook. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open the call up for questions. During the third quarter, we had an active quarter of announcements on revised plans and cost reductions. We've got further announcements in today's press release regarding our Sierrita mine, which Richard will talk more about in his presentation. Today, FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock $3.8 billion that was $3.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015. The net loss attributable to common stocks included net charges totaling $3.7 billion, or $3.43 per share, primarily related to the reduction of the carrying values of oil and gas properties. After adjusting for the net charges, the third quarter 2015 loss attributable to common stock totaled $156 million or $0.15 a share. Our adjusted EBITDA or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization during the third quarter approximated $940 million. We reported total sales of copper during the quarter of 1 billion pounds, gold sales of 294,000 ounces, 23 million pounds of molybdenum, and 13.8 million barrels of oil equivalents. Our average realized price for copper was $2.38 per pound. That was below last year's third quarter average of $3.12 per pound, and gold prices of $1,117 per ounce or below the year-ago quarter average of $1,220 per ounce. Our oil and gas realized price for crude was $55.88 per barrel that included about $11 per barrel of realized cash gains on derivative contracts. That was substantially below last year's average price of $88.58, which included $6.77 of cash losses on derivative contracts. Operating cash flows during the third quarter totaled $822 million and capital expenditures totaled $1.5 billion. We ended the quarter with total debt of $20.7 billion and consolidated cash of $338 million. We have information in the press release on our progress; on our after-market equity programs, to date, we've raised proceeds of $1.2 billion out of a total announced program of $2 billion. We ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position. We had availability under our $4 billion revolver of $3.5 billion and availability under our Cerro Verde credit facility, $1.8 billion credit facility of roughly $300 million. I'll now turn the call over to Richard who'll be referring to the materials on our website. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, everyone. What we're going to talk about here today is what our company is doing to respond to the current weakness in the commodity price market. Almost all of you have heard me talk in the past about how positive the long-term market is for copper. Continue to believe that. But we need to \u2013 we're recognizing the need to prudently manage our self in the short run, and we've taken some really important steps to allow us to do that, so that we can maintain our financial situation and our liquidity and our assets for what we believe is going to be a very positive market for us in our business as we go forward. We have taken and continue to assess very aggressive steps to control costs, limit capital expenditures. We have, as we will show in a later slide, a very positive view about our free cash flow generation, particularly beginning in 2016 as we get the benefit of the expansion projects, the project at Cerro Verde. In this quarter, we've had some really positive steps for our company, the things we worked on for a very long period of time. The Cerro Verde start-up is really going well, really proud of our team there, it's coming up very quickly. Our costs are under control. It's good to see where we are as we complete that project. And then we had an important step, we got a letter from \u2013 of assurances from the Indonesian government about our ability to extend our operations beyond 2021, and a commitment from the government that we'll do so on terms that are consistent with the existing rights on fiscal matters and enforceability matters that's in our existing contract of work. Jim Flores will report on our continuing positive drilling results as we execute our development activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. As Kathleen said, with reluctance, we made a decision to raise some equity for FCX, strengthen our balance sheet, provide insurance against unforeseen potential negative situations, and we've executed that in a very efficient manner. Just two weeks ago, our board announced that we are undertaking and we're now engaged in a strategic review of alternatives for our oil and gas business. There are some alternatives there, the market is a difficult market, unquestionably right now, but we have an overriding goal of being able to manage that business under these alternatives in a way that funds itself with its cash flows or outside financing. Copper markets. Copper averaged $2.39 in the third quarter ranging from $2.21 to $2.62. I just returned last week from the LME event in London where we got a full dose of the financial markets' view of the situation in China and the declining growth and outlook for there. Chinese consumption of copper remains significant. Our physical business there, and actually globally, is relatively strong, stronger than the sense you would get by looking at the financial markets' view of the situation. And consumption in China continues to increase, admittedly at a much lower rate. U.S. and Europe are recovering slowly and certain sections remain positive, in automobiles and construction. But the price volatility, without question, creates short-term demand uncertainty that we're taking into account the way we run our business and manage our financial affairs. Global macroeconomic conditions are weaker than many expected right now. And so, I said, we're being realistic about what we face here. But underlying that in the copper business, the industry continues to be supported by mine supply limitations. We've announced and we're making a new announcement today about curtailing high-cost production throughout the industry. The companies are limiting CapEx. This is resulting in reductions or deferrals of investments in long-term development of supplies, that's going to be positive for the market as we go forward. As we go through this time, existing mines continue to decline in grades. We're going to be moving underground at Grasberg and others in the industry. In South America, going to have to convert from open pit operations to underground operations. And some very important ore bodies are still being stymied by environmental concerns, community restrictions or government issues. So, our copper commodity continues to be supported by supply-side situation. So, let's go over what we're doing as a company to be responsive to the current conditions. We made a 20% reduction in our 2016 consolidated CapEx, and we're continuing to review the CapEx that's currently in our plans for further reductions. In the mining business, as we did in 2008, we've gone through on a mine-by-mine basis to optimize cash flows and consider low prices. As a result of that, today we are announcing a 50% reduction in our mine rates at our Sierrita mine in Eastern Arizona. This is a mine that goes back to the 19th century. It was a mine that has very low grades of copper, but significant molybdenum byproduct, and we're reducing its rate by 50%. And I'll explain that in a few minutes as to why we're not doing 100%. But aggregating together with previously-announced cuts, we're cutting our copper, annual copper production by 5% and with other actions we're taking in the molybdenum business, where prices have been very weak recently, we're reducing our molybdenum production by 20%. We reduced mining CapEx by 25%, including 50% reduction in sustaining capital. Our major project CapEx will be dropping off in 2016 as we complete the Cerro Verde project. We're having a significant reduction in our unit site production delivery cost, 20%; that's going, in 2015, from $1.78 to $1.45 before byproduct credits. The way we've approached this on a mine-by-mine basis, is we had Red Conger and our other members of our team look at each mine, and review their operations with a $2 copper assumption and ensure that we can be cash flow profitable at $2, including sustainable capital. As I mentioned, we're undertaking this review of our oil and gas business. In our numbers today, we're reflecting a $1.8 billion reduction over 30% of CapEx in 2016 and 2017. We deferred investments in several projects. We included acceleration of production, and this review we're undertaking is going to be focused on an ongoing effort to eliminate the cash flow shortfall that exists between this level of capital spending and our cash flows at low crude oil prices. So, here's what we've done with our mining operations. In North America, we've taken steps to cut mine rates at the Tyrone SX/EW operations. We suspended all mining at Miami, where we're engaged in significant reclamation activities, and we reduced mining at Morenci and other North American operations. That aggregates at an annual rate that will come into play over time because it takes time for the reduced placement of material on SX/EW stacks to affect production, but that will result in about 50 million pounds, and we're talking pounds here, reduction annually. The previously announced reduction in stacking rates at El Abra will result in a 100 million pound reduction in 2016. We've had a 35% reduction in molybdenum production at Henderson through adjusting operations there. And today, with this reduction at Sierrita, that's another 100 million pounds. We are continuing to look at the possibility of a full shutdown at Sierrita. The barrier for that is we have weigh stacks there that were developed in the 1970s where we have to capture water coming off those weigh stacks, and we use that water in our mill to operate our mill. If we shut our mill down, we have cost issues and operational issues as to what to do with that water because we have to process it. So, we're looking at alternatives to that. In the meantime, we're using the water and operating the mill at a 50% rate. From costs, we've deferred projects. We reduced our workforce in connection with this cutback. We're aggressively managing capital, operating and administrative costs, and we're keeping our finger on the market and in each of our operations and we're prepared to do whatever it takes, whatever it takes, to keep our operations generating positive cash flows, to protect our liquidity, hold on to these assets for a better day. Slide seven show what we are looking at going into 2016, which we've been pointing to at some times because it will reflect the benefits of investments that we started to pursue at the end of 2010 as we were coming out of the 2008-2009 crisis to invest in very high-return businesses. We've spent or will spend roughly $7.5 billion at expanding our operations in the DRC at Tenke Fungurume, at the projects that's completed now at Morenci, where we paid significant mill additions and other improvements, and now with completion of the major project of \u2013 at Cerro Verde. I want to make a couple of points because there's a lot of focus on this. Aggregate capital was $7.5 billion. It was funded out of cash flows plus a $1.8 billion bank line at Cerro Verde. This is going to be repaid over a relatively short period of time. So, it is not a case of us going out and leveraging the company to invest in these funding it out of cash flows, these projects' economics were based with a view of looking at the possibility of the kind of economic environment we have now. They establish a long-term base for future production and they're going to give us increasing volumes in 2016, where we'll go to over 5 billion pounds consolidated a year at what we think based on today's rate will be a net cash operating cost of $1.15 a pound. You can see that decline in unit net cash cost after byproduct credits, which is roughly at $1.50 level now, going to $1.15 next year. The combined impact of operating cash flows of higher volumes, lower unit costs will be roughly at $2.40 copper of doubling our cash flow from operations next year from $3.3 billion this year to $6.8 billion. At the same time, CapEx will be falling from $6.3 billion to $4 billion. That's roughly half in oil and gas, half in mining. And you can see sustaining capital bonus $600 million a year, and the $2 billion of oil and gas cash flows \u2013 oil and gas CapEx will be under review as part of the process we're now engaged in. We've had really exceptional execution of these projects at Tenke, Morenci and Cerro Verde. Tenke achieved full operating rates early in 2013, Morenci achieved full rates in mid-2015, and Cerro Verde is ramping up now. It's a major project, it will be the world's largest concentrator facilities, we're basically tripling output there, and full rates are expected to be achieved very early in 2016, and we're moving up on that right now. You can see some \u2013 a picture of Cerro Verde on slide nine. Notably, we've done this without facing community opposition, as many mining projects are based in Peru. Our team there has done a great job in doing community projects, including providing fresh water to the city of Arequipa, the second largest city in Peru. We're getting water for this project from a waste water collection plant. Previously, that city was just dumping its waste water into the river. Now, it's being modernized to collect waste water, treat it, the ecology of the river is improving, farmers like that and it's getting us a source of water without having to compete with agriculture interests for that. It's a big step for us and it's allowed us to complete this project, to-date, without protest from the local community. In fact, support and accolades from the local community. A little complicated slide on slide 10, but just to show you how quickly we're ramping this up, we've achieved two-thirds of production in a month-and-a-half. We have two major primary crushers. One is operating, the other is commissioning. We have secondary crushing with eight units. Four are now operating. One is commissioning, three will be commissioned in the fourth quarter. This will use modern, high-pressure grinding roll mills, which we are using there now, and also using as part of our operations in Indonesia. Eight new mills, four are operating, three \u2013 one is being commissioned, three comes on in the fourth quarter. Six modern 40,000 ton per day ball mills, which are coming on-stream quickly in our flotation circuits. This gives you a visual just to see how quickly we're ramping this up. So far, knock on wood, thanks to Red and his team, we're achieving this without hitches, and we're focused on completing it. Turning to Indonesia with our underground development, this is a major long-term project for us. You can see that the chart at the bottom as we complete mining from the open pit scheduled by the end of 2017, our future operations will be all underground. We have an existing mine called the DOZ, where we block cave, started doing that in the early 1980s. The recent extension of that is starting up \u2013 has started up in the third quarter, it's a deep MLZ mine, with very positive grades of copper and gold. And then when we complete mining the open pit, we'll be moving to the Grasberg Block Cave mine, which we'll begin ramping up in 2018. Again, this is mine with 1% copper, eight-tenths of gram of gold per ton. This is an exceptional project, exceptional project. To-date, we've spent $3.5 billion of capital on the operations. And as we look forward, PTFI share, this is a joint venture with Rio Tinto with our company's share of these underground projects, we will be spending capital of $800 million a year for the next several years, including power and processing facilities. And then, as we go forward, as we look in the first 10 years of the life-of-mine average for this underground operation, we will be, to our company's interest, achieving 1.1 billion pounds of copper and 1.5 million ounces of gold a year. So that's the reason why we're spending this money and working hard to secure our contract rights. This spending is conditional on getting the approval of the government on acceptable terms for an extension of our contract. And with this new step that we've gotten, which is a quote from the letter that we received earlier this month on page 12, we feel that an important step has been made in getting documentation of these contract rights on a basis that's acceptable to us and to the government. Jim Bob met with the President in Indonesia and worked with the mine minister in securing this commitment. And it's a very, very important step for us. At the same time, we are progressing with our negotiations with union officials and expect to have our new CLA approved imminently. Now, looking at our worldwide, large-scale mines, we have a group of mines globally that \u2013 potential of having 1 billion pounds of copper, roughly 500,000 tons of copper a year as we go forward, that's the base for having a company that, when we acquired Phelps Dodge, our goal was to set and make ourselves the premier company in the copper mining industry. And we've done that, and we have the resources to continue to do that. So, we have the Morenci mine now with the recent expansion and future expansion opportunities. Cerro Verde is being completed. It will operate even though we're curtailing current production. It has an enormous resource that's available for future consideration. Tenke Fungurume mine is operating well, generating cash, returning capital, has significant growth opportunities. We just had some very positive exploratory drilling intercepts there that are expanding our knowledge of that ore body and giving us opportunities for future growth. And then the Grasberg mine, I've talked about earlier, with its underground development. We have a really interesting greenfield exploration project in Serbia, where we've had some really significant intercepts, with substantial indicated volumes and high grades, 1% copper grades and gold byproduct. So, now, we have all these great opportunities to develop mine operations. I want to be clear. After we complete these current projects, until the market warrants further investments, we're not going to be making them. We're going to be planning for them in the future, but as we complete these projects, we're going to realize the benefits of the cash flow, our improved cost situation to delever our company, but underlying all that is an enormous future growth opportunity that will be available to us when the market warrants it. Before turning off \u2013 handing the ball off to Jim, let's talk about oil and gas business, I want to go back and mention what we did at a board meeting earlier this month roughly two weeks ago. First of all, we reconstituted the FCX board in response to discussions with shareholders broadly. Previously, we had a board with 13 members and independent members and three management members. That was reduced to six independent members and two management members, and then we've added two representatives Carl Icahn, who had a position in our company. And as we go forward, we're all going to be working together with a common goal of trying \u2013 of working to increase the value of shareholdings in FCX, to increase the value of our share price, to run business in a prudent way, and we're going to be working with our board to get everyone's ideas as to how we do that. Our objectives with this oil and gas review, which we announced during the time of reconstituting our board is to achieve our original goal that we had when the deal was first announced of achieving self-funding of that business. Now, current market's challenge for that, no question, given where we were with our operation, and we're going to look at a variety of alternatives to enhance values to the FCX shareholders. What we have is an opportunity to do that because of the quality of our assets in our oil and gas business. These are high-quality assets that have very attractive opportunities for low-risk development growth over time. We have significant existing Deepwater Gulf of Mexico infrastructure that has large excess capacity, which will allow us to do drilling for resources that can be tied back to these facilities and completed and brought on production in a low-cost way. We have a talented and experienced team lead by Jim, and they know how to do this, and they are committed to doing it. Alternatives will include potential ideas for separating the business. We talked about an IPO. We've gone through the SEC process, and we're positioned to do that if the market provides us that opportunity. It's a difficult market right now, but that's an opportunity for us. We will look at various alternatives for spin-off. All of these things are challenging in today's market, at the same time, we'll be evaluating other funding alternatives through joint ventures or other transactions. And in the event there's a time required to get the markets to the point of where we can execute a separation-type transaction, we're going to come up with plans to significantly reducing spending, so that we achieve this goal of self-funding in any circumstance. And I want to make that clear as to what we're doing with this oil and gas review. So Jim is going to give us a report now of where we stand operationally with the oil and gas business. James C. Flores - Vice Chairman; President/CEO, Oil & Gas, Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thank you, Richard. On page 15, we have our third quarter 2015 highlights. You can see where 61% of our sales were in the Gulf of Mexico. It continues to be our most important asset area, while California continues to be a strong steady producer, and the rest is our gas business, onshore in Haynesville and Highlander area. We had EBITDA of about $0.3 billion for the third quarter, trailing 12 months of $1.3 billion. We had \u2013 continue to have positive drilling results in the Gulf of Mexico and derisking our business plan. The Horn Mountain Deep well and the King well, we announced two wells with tremendous reservoirs and producibility. And we continue to deal with the success we have in our development drilling as we try to manage costs and manage our CapEx. At the same point in time, we did not plan for 100% success in our development activities at these fields. And what I mean by that is the 100% success requires us to complete wells after drilling and so forth that we do not plan to capitalize. So, it becomes very much an orchestra of cutting and deferring projects at the same point in time continue to execute our business plan to create value long term for our company, but also be in a situation of be able to provide an excellent production profile and add value on a daily basis of production in 2016 going forward. What I mean by that is because of the positive drilling results in the Deepwater is our oil production. Crude oil production 2015 to 2016 is going to increase by 25% with our CapEx of $1.8 billion in 2016. That 25% increase, we'll be able to kept flat going forward for 2017 on, in a $45 oil market, at a $1 billion of spending and \u2013 of CapEx. So, that's flat from 2016 through 2017 on, at a $1 billion of spending in 2017 after spending $1.8 billion in 2016, and increasing production by 25%. Our business would be very \u2013 the cost will be variable from 2017 on as we have drilling rig contracts and service contracts and commitments rolling off that have already been committed to and execution in our production increase, much like finishing a large mining project in 2016. So, our ability to ratchet capital up or down in 2017 going forward, remains maximum flexibility. The $1 billion of CapEx in 2017, I mentioned, is a 65% decrease from capital in 2015 at the peak of our spending and ramping up in the Gulf of Mexico. The field developments in Heidelberg and Holstein Deep, first production anticipated in mid-2016 continue to stay on track. Excellent execution by our operator, Anadarko, Heidelberg and, of course, we're 100% on project at Holstein Deep. The announced CapEx reductions that Richard talked about in 2016, 2017 continue to expand, by deferring projects and right-sizing our business for a $45 long-term oil market. Again, that is not a forecast. It's just the way we're going to gauge our business and we certainly hope oil prices are higher than $45, where our shareholders can reap the profits. They've certainly taken the pain for the last 18 months with the severe decline going down. We suspect the substantial oil volumes and the 25% increase in 2016, and cash margins in the near term going forward as we control our spending. On page 16 is a familiar slide of our assets. We continue to expand all the production here, and this is where our high-margin barrels. And it costs us about $20 a barrel to drill and hook up our wells to these facilities, which is about 25% the cost of a newbuild project, when you have to put all these facility costs ahead of it. So with a $20 a barrel cost of hooking up the production, less a $12 a barrel LOE cost in the Gulf of Mexico currently, and $3 or $4 of G&A and interest and so forth, we're talking about a full-cycle business with a cost between $36 and $38 a barrel, which makes a profit in the $45 barrel realm. So, it's a highly-profitable business and it's the best place for us to spend our capital. The Deepwater Gulf of Mexico focus map on page 17 refreshes everybody's memories of where our assets are. You'll see the red, Power Nap discovery we discussed, which is going in with the operator, and we're working with regulators to figure out what our development plan will be there over the long term. A key slide on page 18, where we have production that's coming on in our 100% owned wells in 2015, 2016 and 2017. You can see 2016 is a very active year. The Kilo/Oscar, Qu\u00e9bec/Victory KQOV, that is not named after Kathleen Quirk, but it does \u2013 because it's a prolific area. And Holstein Deep 1, 2 and 3 and our Heidelberg wells, that's our significant oil production increase. And then in 2017, interestingly enough, we can put on Horn Mountain Deep, Horn Mountain Updip, King D-3 (sic) [D-13] (34:31) and King D-9, but under the $1 billion CapEx scenario, we'll only put on one of these areas, and we'll roll one of the areas in 2018. You can start to see the flavor of the operations and flexibility and keeping production steady, managing our capital and continue to provide returns back [ph] to our stockholders (34:40). Richard, I'll turn it over to you for the outlook. How's that? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's great, Jim. Thanks. Our current outlook for sales for 2015 is $4.1 billion. That's briefly $100 million lower than our previous outlook. Most of that comes from Indonesia, where we're being affected by this very significant El Ni\u00f1o event. And, ironically, in an area where rainfall ranges from 200 inches to 400 inches a year, we have water constraints because of El Ni\u00f1o. This happened to us in 1997-1998, but it's limiting how much material we can run through our mill. We have been taking exceptional steps of getting water there, including trucking water up the mountain. You guys have been there before. So, this is an effect. Our production cuts really come in over time because of the way that adjustments to SX/EW operations work, they will be more in place for 2016. Our goal is down 100,000 ounces. Again, this is because of Grasberg. The \u2013 I mentioned the operating cash flow numbers from the previous time. Each $0.10 change in copper price for the fourth quarter means $110 million for us. And we've previously mentioned the unit cost and capital expenditure changes which \u2013 CapEx changes to date represent no changes from what we disclosed in July with the oil and gas CapEx under review. Sales profile by year is shown on page 20. You can see impact in 2016 of the completion of Cerro Verde, but also the access to very high-grade ore at the bottom of the Grasberg pit, as we complete mining there. This is something we've been talking about since we started developing Grasberg in the early 1990s, at an operation where we once \u2013 where mine rates were 750,000 tons a day. We're going to be dropping to 200,000 tons in 2016 and down to 100,000 tons, 150,000 tons in 2017 with no stripping. There'll be no stripping virtually of those years, and we'll just have access to this very high-grade ore. So, it'll be a very profitable operation. And you can see the impact of that on our gold production in 2016, 2017. Our quarterly sales profile is presented in the reference slides. Also, the longer-term outlook for Grasberg beyond mining in the pit is shown in the reference slides. So, slide 21. You can see how our 2015 production breaks down by region and how our cost structure would be for this year, where we are very consistent with previous guidance of having consolidated net cash cost after our product credits in the $1.50 range and dropping down to $1.15 next year under current commodity price environment. Our EBITDA and cash flow opportunities are presented at various copper prices on slide 22. This is an average for 2016, 2017 and excludes working capital changes. But it shows how it varies going from copper prices at $2.25 to $3.25. And at the lower end of the prices, we'd have operating cash flows after taxes and interest of $5.25 billion. And that would rise to over $7 billion at $2.75, to show you how leveraged we are to prices. We present a sensitivity chart that we present quarter for your use and looking at how to adjust that for commodity prices and certain cost elements. And our capital expenditures are shown on page 24, where we're going from CapEx in 2014 at $7 billion plus to $6 billion plus this year, and dropping the $4 billion plus with oil and gas CapEx under review at this time. And I want to just comment on this at the market. Equity offering, as I said, we took this step reluctantly. None of us like raising equity in this kind of marketplace, but we concluded it was prudent as a further step to protect our liquidity and our balance sheet now. We found this to be an efficient way to raise capital without having to go to market and face the pressures that come about from a marketed deal and the pricing implications of that. We did this in the first quarter of 2009, and now we've executed a $1 billion range in the third quarter where we raised capital at higher than market prices. We have a second $1 billion program approved by our board. Had to back out the market, as we got close to earnings release. But to date, we raised $200 million on that, since the initial offering, for what it's worth, and you know with the movement of our companies and other commodity prices during the calendar year this year. But we significantly outperformed other companies since announcing the first ATM offering. As I said, it gives us advantage of deciding when we want to place the shares in the market. We do it at significantly lower commissions and costs than you would have in a traditional follow-on offering. And it allows us to price share issuances in appropriate days in the marketplace when there's demand for the shares and gives us the flexibility of execution. We are committed to debt reduction, challenged by commodity prices, but we recognize the need to do this. We have a large resource base and strong cash flows. And with capital discipline, we have the ability to do this over time. We will be generating cash with increasing volumes, declining CapEx. This will enhance our credit metrics. To date, the credit rating agencies have supported our investment-grade rating, that's challenged by commodity prices, but we're taking steps that we believe will be positive in supporting that. And as we move forward, this situation will be improved. We work hard to maintain available liquidity under our bank credit facilities. We have a $4 billion corporate facility at FCX, and $3.5 billion of that is currently available. We have a $1.8 billion facility at Cerro Verde, which is being used to fund that expansion. We have $300 million left on it. And we have, because of our past financing, an attractive average interest cost of 3.7%. Small maturities for the next couple of years, and we'll be looking for opportunities to deal with our balance sheet as we go forward. So, with our long-lived reserves, our really strong production base, this great portfolio of undeveloped resources across our businesses globally, and with the great team of workers and management we have, we are up to dealing with these issues and working hard to create long-term values for our shareholders. Thank you for your interest. And now, we are prepared to respond to your questions. Operator : Our first question will come from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, Kathleen and everybody. My question is actually for Kathleen. Could you talk a bit about what the stance is of the credit agencies toward the current commodity environment and obviously, everyone can appreciate your current leverage level. But have you received any kind of language from them that they're starting to get concerned about the protracted nature of your net debt balance? Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Well, Jorge, I think you can see the press releases that both S&P and Moody's made during the quarter. They have \u2013 their commodities team have updated their outlook for commodities across the board including copper. And they undertook a review of Freeport during the quarter that both agencies affirmed our ratings and we did go to it from a stable outlook to negative. We've been in close contact with S&P, Moody's and Fitch really to walk them through our plans for debt reduction, show them how we get there with our organic business in terms of rising volumes, lower costs and lower CapEx. And so, the expectation is that as we get through 2016, our credit metrics will improve significantly and be within their parameters for our rating. And we're very focused on executing those plans so that our outlook can be moved back to stable. And that's really what they have been looking at in terms of our plans. But they've been running numbers at different commodity prices. Like I said, we've been in close communication. But they do see 2015, as we have signaled all year, as a bridge year, getting to this higher cash flow and free cash flow more importantly in 2016 and 2017. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And, Jorge. Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : This is Richard. I think without question, they're giving us credit for what we did in deleveraging after the Phelps Dodge deal and how we managed the crisis in 2008-2009. So, they are looking at what we say we're going to do. Now, it's on us as a management team to show that same degree of discipline in executing our plans as we go forward. Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. And sorry, just maybe a technical question. I'm not sure Kathleen or Jim would answer this. But what oil price assumption are you guys using to determine the carrying value of your oil assets, which obviously took another write-down this quarter? But where are we just as a jumping off point if we had to do a further mark-to-market? What are you kind of using as your baseline for oil at this point? James C. Flores - Vice Chairman; President/CEO, Oil & Gas, Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Jorge, we're required to use SEC price deck which is a trailing 12 month average. If you use the forward curve, forward curve is actually lower by a few dollars than the SEC price deck. So, you'll see us continue. If oil prices continue to stay in the $40, $45 range, the $50 range, you'll see, in the fourth quarter, you'll see a slight reduction there. But all depends if oil prices stay steady or go up or erode going forward. But we're kind of at \u2013 we're at that apex point where we may not totally be there just because of the oil price in the fourth quarter. So far, here in October, has been a few dollars below the SEC price, average price for the last 12 months that we used for that reporting purposes. Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thanks very much. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, Jorge, we used the realized prices in each region we have, but they are referenced off a WTI price of $59 a barrel at the end of the third quarter. So, that's not the exact price we use because we adjust it for what oil is selling for in California and offshore. But the reference price, the WTI price, and we don't have a choice on this. This is the \u2013 these unfortunate SEC rules that require us to use this trailing-12 month average and it was $59 WTI for the third quarter. Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. But it sounds like, as you're saying, you're basically cycling that out by the fourth quarter. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, that all depends. It won't all cycle out because in the fourth quarter we'll use the four quarters in 2015, and in the first quarter, the price was $70 something. So, it takes time for this to cycle through using the 12-month average, that's why I call these rules unfortunate. James C. Flores - Vice Chairman; President/CEO, Oil & Gas, Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: But at the fourth quarter, we're getting through the \u2013 we're getting through a lower average price and if you have a $55 oil price in 2016, for example, we'll be kind of there, versus if it's $45 price in 2016, there'll be some more for reevaluation ahead. Does that kind of help you? Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Brian Yu with Citi. Please go ahead. Brian Hsien Yu - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Thanks and good morning. First question is just on Indonesia. It sounded like the government would make \u2013 maybe seeking a little bit higher royalties. Can you speak to that? And then, on the guidance that's built in there for next year, how much of a wage increase is reflected in those numbers? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Brian. We agreed last year when we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the government that allowed us to go forward with restoring exports at the time and also set the stage for further discussions with the government leading to this recent letter. At that point, we agreed to increase the royalties that were in our contract of work to the royalties that were specified in the 2009 mining law. That was a concession we made to meet the government's aspirations. And so, in our discussions with the government now, those are the royalty rates that would be reflected in our extending contract going forward. And they would be fixed. They wouldn't be subject to further changes. So the \u2013 like we see here in the United States with this presidential campaign, there'll be a lot of comments politically coming out of Indonesia. But that's the facts of where we are with our royalties and with this recent understanding with the government about how we'll go forward. Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : And Brian, the second part of your question regarding the wages. We have made assumptions on what we expect the wage negotiations to be concluded at. But it wouldn't be appropriate for us to give that at this point because we're still finalizing those negotiations. But the numbers that you're looking at includes what we expect the results to be in our ongoing discussions, which we're progressing as we speak. Brian Hsien Yu - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. That's helpful. Maybe the second question is just on the oil and gas with your plans, either a partial IPO or a spin-off, is there a cash dollar amount that we can think about that you would put into those assets under either of those scenarios? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's really what we're reviewing now. So \u2013 and again that depends on alternatives and marketplace and our view of \u2013 we're going to have a view of how to make sure whatever we do is supportive of FCX's financial condition and financial position. At the same time, if we do have a separation, we have to separate the business in a way of where it's sustainable on its own and can trade well. And so that's the trade-offs we're going. But Brian, it's \u2013 again, that's subject to this review and we'll be pursuing this aggressively. And further information will come out as we \u2013 as our board reaches decisions on it. Brian Hsien Yu - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Definitely appreciate that. All right. Thank you. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. David Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks for taking my questions. I did want to drill in a little bit more on Indonesia. Just the commentary in the press release regarding the longer term, the underground development and potentially pushing some of that out, I was wondering, first of all, if you could give us a bit more color on the thought process there, the timing associated with more visibility on potentially deferring some of that CapEx and when we should hear more definitive commentary. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Well, the numbers you see today actually reflect some of the work that we're doing about adjusting our longer-term mine plans. Previously, the annual spending on a gross basis for the joint venture was a $1 billion. We've now \u2013 annually, average. We've now reduced that to $800 million. And part of that has to do with how we mine and ultimately process ore that contain pyrites. And that includes some of the Grasberg Block Cave ore. And that would in the longer range affect how we do with the Kucing Liar ore body. But altering the mine plans to avoid the bulk of this pyrite ore, we can defer capital spending on the processing facilities and the transport and storage facilities for pyrite. We're developing plans to do that with \u2013 so that we don't end up wasting significant amounts of ore. So, it's a timing opportunity that would allow us to then go back and make those investments in mining and processing that ore in the future, and we're continuing to do that. But that's the major factor, Dave, along the lines of what you're talking about. That's how we're dealing with the long-term mine plans at Grasberg. David Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. All right. Thanks. And then just separately on the strategic review of the energy business, the alternatives for the energy business, I'm wondering if you could give us a feeling for timing, when we should get more visibility on that front as well. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we reconstituted our board two weeks ago. We announced this review. We're starting the process now of coming up with alternatives and how to evaluate it. We need \u2013 there is a degree of urgency in dealing with these capital cost. So I'm not in a position right now giving you any red line time dates, but I can tell you, it's a matter of focus, and we are approaching this immediately. David Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Is it reasonable to say within the next, say six months, we'll get something or is it longer? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Within that timeframe. David Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Tony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC: Thank you very much. Good morning, all. Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Good morning. Tony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC: I've got a couple of questions here. First one is on Indonesia. It does sounds encouraging that the process is moving forward. Now, assuming you get resolution on the extension of the COW, how can you assure investors that you'll be able to get a fair value with the additional 20% stake in PTFI? There seem to be conflicting reports about the ability to do an IPO, and I was wondering and associated, is that now off the table? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, Tony. It's not off the table. Throughout this whole process, our position has been and now the government supports it, it was in the MOU in mid-2014, it's reflected in what the letter says, is that any divestment would be on the basis of fair value. And exactly how we divest depends on how we work with the government on it. The government, the central government itself will have the opportunity to acquire shares, they've had that opportunity in the past and haven't elected to do it, but we will work with them on it. The possibility of sales to stay-on companies is there. The possibility of an IPO is something we've done work on, and we can see some benefits to that to be traded on the Indonesia Exchange. Government officials would \u2013 some government officials are very supportive of that. So, all of this process is, again, conditional on getting the final documentation of the extension, and then we're prepared immediately at that point to go forward in working with the government as to exactly how to do that. But the IPO is certainly one of the alternatives that we'll be talking with them about. Tony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And then I got a question also on oil and gas. And of the $2 billion CapEx, how much is purely sustaining and how much of that number is required to develop and kind of reload inventory with prospects? James C. Flores - Vice Chairman; President/CEO, Oil & Gas, Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: All right. Tony, look at this way. About $750 million will keep production flat in the Gulf of Mexico and California. So, you're really talking about $2 billion is forecasted and I might have mentioned today that we're trying to work \u2013 continue to work with that number. Everything above that would be toward the growth CapEx (58:11) 25% increases. Tony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. James C. Flores - Vice Chairman; President/CEO, Oil & Gas, Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And going forward \u2013 going forward to 2017, that's kind of $750 million to $1 billion. That's why at $45 and even lower, we can continue to be cash flow neutral once we have this production on, and just defend it by putting on one or two wells a year. When you have 13 good discoveries in your inventory, it's pretty easy to see the visibility there. Tony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And just \u2013 I'm curious what do you think is the most preferable outcome? I mean, a complete spin-off to existing shareholders or what the \u2013 obviously, it's a matter of debt allocation and a lot of other factors. But I'm just curious as to management's thinking. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, Tony, that's something that's going to be a board decision. And so, for us to come out now and say \u2013 we're going to have lots of ideas. The ideas are going to be considered and assessed in terms of creating value for the FCX shareholders. And that's going to be a board deliberation. And all of us have ideas. And we'll present those ideas, do analysis on them. We'll have expert advice on the markets and what's best. And that \u2013 then the decision is going to come out. It wouldn't be appropriate at all for us to start speculating on where that's going to go. James C. Flores - Vice Chairman; President/CEO, Oil & Gas, Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Tony, where Rich highlighted the board reconstruction, I resigned from the board and so forth. That's so we wanted to give the board maximum flexibility to have as far as separating the oil and gas business if that makes sense. Their advisors advise them and so forth of where the highest and best value of FCX is. That's the path forward. But they have maximum flexibility. There's no sacred path or no prohibited path at this point. So, that's the value for the FCX shareholders, that's the number one goal here. Tony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And just \u2013 thanks for that color. And just a quick one on Sierrita. And I was wondering if the evaluation you're doing now points to a full shut-down there, what impact might this have on your overall unit cash costs? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, Sierrita is \u2013 at these \u2013 it's really such an interesting mine because it's got low grades and big moly content. You don't have to look back many years ago to where it was our lowest cost mine. And now it's our highest cost mine. So, at current levels, unit cost are $1.90 roughly. And so that's why we cut it back and if we could cut it back totally, we're dealing with this water management issue, we would do it. But it's not big enough to have a material impact on our consolidated costs. But it's our highest cost mine or among our highest cost mines, it's the one obviously that deserves the cutback attention. Tony B. Rizzuto - Cowen and Company, LLC: Good to see the discipline. Thanks very much. Appreciate the color. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thanks, Tony. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sussman with Clarkson. Please go ahead. Jeremy R. Sussman - Clarkson Capital Markets : Yeah. Hello and thanks for taking my question. You spoke, obviously, quite a bit about some of the oil and gas initiatives that you are reviewing. But I'm just curious on the copper side. Outside of some of the production potential curtailments that you're looking at, if you consider something either small or even large on the asset sale side, and I guess the context is copper does seem to still be the one commodity that the majors, or at least one of the commodities, I guess, that some of the majors are looking to expand upon. Thank you. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thanks, Jeremy. Listen, we have an open mind on how we approach things. We have a constant flow of people coming to us with ideas, both companies, bankers, some of the private equity funds. So, we get opportunities to consider a lot of things. If you look at the majors, though, there's a consistent positive view of the longer-term copper market. And so, the better assets in that market are owned by the larger companies, and so, that's what is really a barrier for doing major transactions. But, listen, we are \u2013 as I said, I was in London last week, saw a lot of people, had a lot of discussions, a lot of people want to meet, present ideas and we're open-minded, we're going to listen to the ideas. Jeremy R. Sussman - Clarkson Capital Markets : That's great. Thanks very much for taking my question. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : Thank you very much for all the decisions you've made in the last 90 days for the shareholders and progress since your last call. It's just been spectacular. First question, if you sell down from 90% to 70% in Indonesia, would you be required \u2013 would Freeport be required to fund the entire $800 million average full-year CapEx budget, or would the buyer be required to pay its share? First question. Second question, if I may, have any of your commodity long-term price expectations changed in the last year or two as everything has fallen in price? It's notable that a week or two ago, Toyota said that by 2015, they'll stop making gasoline engines. In New Jersey, there is a 3,400 megawatt, 100 mile long wind farm that federal government auctioned without asking New Jersey. West Texas is one company putting up 400,000 solar panels and Fort Stockton and I guess there're several others coming after them. And all these investments are being made not on the basis of price as they affect the energy market. It can create some doubts in our minds once in a while. Please we \u2013 we want to thank you for all the good decisions. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thanks, John for your comment about steps we've taken. With regard to your first question, the divestment we're talking about is a divestment of shares, common stock in PTFI. And so, whereas now, we own 90% plus. The government has a 9.36% interest. After we go through this process of divestment, which will occur after we get the documentation of our contract extension, we would own 70%, but it's a share investment. And all of these PTFI funding of CapEx is coming out of its cash flows. So, we don't contemplate any of the shareholders being FCX or the new shareholders having any requirements to make capital investments in the company. So, it would come out of cash flows. Then with respect to this future of the energy business, I'll make one side comment. Everything you talked about from electric cars to alternative energy investments requires substantial amounts of copper. And so, that's going to be the demand factor for future \u2013 the future of the copper business and all of these issues related to the future of energy and the future of climate change and so forth are \u2013 is an unfolding story still to be played out for the foreseeable future. The world's going to require substantial volumes of oil and gas to run these economies and maintain standards of living. James C. Flores - Vice Chairman; President/CEO, Oil & Gas, Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: John, as long as Exxon, Shell, Chevron, BP are in oil business, I'm going to be in the oil business. So, that's the way I look at it. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli and Company. Please go ahead. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli: Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Just a quick question on the dividend. How are you thinking about paying the dividend now, especially considering that you're issuing stock and it would seem that you're free cash flow negative, at least in the current point in time? So, is there a potential for that dividend to be cut back. And second thing is in terms of the equity raises, how much more do you think you would need to raise to have an appropriate buffer for whatever might transpire in the commodities market, again, given that it seems like next year with the high grades at Grasberg in 2017, you'll be pretty significantly free cash flow positive? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Good question. This dividend issue, we made a decision to substantially reduce the dividend earlier this year. We maintained a relatively small dividend because certain institutions have dividend requirements. The board's going to continue to review that. And we'll continue to look at. With respect to equity raises, the board's approved this $2 billion raise. We're going to have our finger on the market with the factors that you mentioned. I believe it will, absent some further changes in our free cash flow generation, it's the cash flow coming in, in 2016. This appears to be sufficient to provide the kind of buffer that we need. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli: Okay. And just a quick question. I know other people kind of asked this, but on the oil and gas business, there are $2.5 billion of oil and gas senior notes. Would it be reasonable to assume that that would be the only amount of debt that the oil and gas business would be able to sustain if it were to be spun off? Or could it potentially take on more debt? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, that's a valuation we're doing. It's not related to the source of the debt at all. I mean, that's just the legacy issue that came to our consolidated company when the acquisition was made. So, we're evaluating it more broadly from a financial perspective as to what would be sustainable for the entity that was separated if, in fact, we go a separation route. But it's not tied to any specific issue. Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : And Chris, just as a reminder, the FCX parent guarantees that debt. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli: Okay. Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : So, that guarantee doesn't go away. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli: Okay. Okay. So, it's just a big picture valuation determination as to how much debt the oil and gas business will be able to take on? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Exactly. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli: Right. Okay. I understand. Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS. Please go ahead. Brian T. MacArthur - UBS Securities Canada, Inc.: Good morning. I just want to go back to Dave's question on the longer-term situation at Grasberg because you talked about deferring the pyrite ore and stuff. But when I look at the 2018 through 2022 stuff, it all looks like the same guidance. Are you just pushing stuff post-2022 back by deferring this capital, i.e. the KL gets pushed back from 2025 or what exactly is happening there? Because you've obviously been able to save some money up front, but without any change to production in the next five years. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, and that's why it's attractive. That's why it's attractive, Brian. KL is scheduled to come on later. It is much later than that. So the real issue about production is, with the Grasberg Block Cave, and near-term production isn't really affected in any significant way by this deferral of capital, and that would come into play, basically, post-2020. But it's the Grasberg Block Cave production as opposed to the KL production. I mean what we're doing is, as we come out of the pit and start mining the Block Cave, we ramp up to get back to a mill operation of 250,000 tons a day after the ramp-up, which will require several years. And then we have \u2013 the great thing about this operation is that we have the ore to feed a 250,000 ton per day mill through 2041. Brian T. MacArthur - UBS Securities Canada, Inc.: Right. So are there any secondary benefits by pushing this pyrite ore? Like when you build the new smelter or whatever, does it allow you to put you throughput better there? So you get another benefit there, as well? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, and it also potentially gives us the opportunity to kind of stage the smelter investment at a smaller level to begin with, which saves some capital, and this is desirable, and then deal with it later on, as we ramp back into the pyrite. So there's benefit on CapEx standpoint, both at the mine and mill operations in Papua, as well as capital required for the smelter. Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : But Brian, all of this is still being looked at and optimized as we go through it. So what you're looking at is our most recent thinking, but we're continuing to look at it, and continue to look at how we smooth out, concentrate production, so we don't have big spikes, and have enough smelter capacity to be able to deal with it. So, it's a work in progress, but what you're seeing is what our current thinking is. Brian T. MacArthur - UBS Securities Canada, Inc.: Great. Thanks. And maybe just one question on the oil and gas. You talked about the 25% increase in oil from, I assume, Gulf of Mexico. But what's happening at California next? It looks like it's coming down in the third quarter. Capital there is pretty small. Is it actually on a decline the next three years? Or should we think it bottoms out and flat or how should I think about the reinvestment on that part of the equation? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we've cut reinvestment from $300 million two years ago to $70 million this current year. Probably need to get closer to $125 million, $150 million, to keep production completely flat at this point in time, Brian. So what happens with the thermal reservoirs out there, as you've been heating them for years and years, you can cut capital for about 24 months before they start kind of cooling. And as they start cooling, the oil gets more viscous, and the production rate slows. We're all talking about small, small increments here. So we'll need to start reinvesting there, probably in late 2016, early 2017, and then it flattens out. The one production adjustment that you're seeing is in our offshore business, where we have our (74:06) platform, which is our highest cost production. It's shut in, and it's shut in indefinitely, due to the plains all American pipeline situation, where the pipeline ruptured and they're shut in due to repair work. And that forecast is in years, so we're not sure that production will be restored. So I think the new production level that you see currently is pretty good for 2016 and going forward. Brian T. MacArthur - UBS Securities Canada, Inc.: Great. And I should just use about $100 million in capital in California for the next two years, then? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. That's probably good average at this point. Brian T. MacArthur - UBS Securities Canada, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Brian. Operator : Now, we'll turn the call over to management for any closing remarks. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All I'll say is thank you again for being on the call and your interest. We'll look forward to reporting progress as we go forward and if you have any follow-up questions, as you study the material, or for any reason you feel free to contact David Joint. And we'll make sure the right person answers your questions. Thanks a lot, everybody. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation.

As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for questions. Today, FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $4.1 billion, $3.47 per share for the fourth quarter 2015. As indicated in the press release, where we have a reconciliation, the net loss included charges totaling $4.1 billion or $3.45 per share, primarily for the reduction of the carrying values of our oil and gas properties. After adjusting for these net charges, the fourth quarter 2015 adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $21 million or $0.02 per share. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the fourth quarter totaled $919 million. We have a reconciliation of that in our slide materials for your reference. The consolidated copper sales totaled 1.15 billion pounds in the fourth quarter. Our gold sales totaled 338,000 ounces. We sold 20 million pounds of molybdenum and 13.2 million barrels of oil equivalents during the quarter. Our average realized copper price was $2.18 per pound. That was below 2014's fourth quarter average of $2.95 per pound. Gold prices averaged $1,067per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2015. And our realized price for crude oil was $48.88 per barrel, which included $11 per barrel of realized cash gains on derivative contracts. We generated operating cash flows during the fourth quarter of $612 million and funded capital expenditures totaling $1.3 billion during the quarter. We ended the year with $20.4 billion in debt and consolidated cash was $224 million. As indicated in the release, since August of 2015, a total of $2 billion of gross proceeds have been raised under FCX's at-the-market equity program, including approximately $1 billion during the fourth quarter of 2015. And we ended the year with approximately 1.25 billion common shares outstanding and had no amounts drawn under our $4 billion bank credit facility. I'll turn the call over to Richard, who will be using the slide materials that are on our website. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, everyone. This is going to be a different call than we have \u2013 have been done in the past for obvious reasons. We face serious challenges because of what's going on in the marketplace and because of the situation with our balance sheet, and we want to convey that we're addressing this seriously and with a degree of urgency and we're very focused on it. So let's think about what's changed for us since our last earnings call. On slide 3, we show the obvious, the drop in copper prices, the drop in oil prices. And as we talked about it at the end of the third quarter, we were looking at various scenarios that ranged from a further decline in prices at that time to other more positive scenarios. We're experiencing the worst of those scenarios right now, with copper dropping to $2 and oil dropping to $30. And we're also facing a market of where market sentiment continues to be negative, particularly negative about China, and we have to prepare for that. So the issue is what are we doing? What's Freeport going to do about this right now? And I want to convey to you what we are doing. And turn to slide 4. We are aggressively managing cost, CapEx, production, cash flow and working for capital raising transactions to address our balance sheet. At the third quarter earning release, we talked about how we had restructured our board of directors. We had gone from 16 previous members to seven. We added two representatives of Carl Icahn, a significant shareholders of ours now. I can tell you, we have a board that's fully engaged and fully supportive of what we need to do and very active. And we're listening to the input of our board members and reviewing our plans as we go forward. At that time, we had also revised our management structure from the previous Office of the Chairman to go to a different structure, and that structure was further changed in December with Jim Bob stepping down as Executive Chairman of our company. Gerry Ford, our Lead Director, has been elected as a Non-Executive Chairman. And I now have, effective January 1, executive responsibility for our Global Business, including our Oil & Gas business and our business in Indonesia. Jim Bob continues to work as an advisor and he's working very helpfully in dealing with our ongoing discussions with the government in Indonesia. But we have a clear strategic direction of our company now, and that strategic direction is to create shareholder value out of our copper and minerals business as we go forward. We're going to be looking at our oil and gas assets as a way to generate value to help support that strategy. And we're going to be focused immediately on addressing our balance sheet issues. And one thing I believe is, that's been lost in the noise of the turmoil in the commodities market business, the issues relating to our over-leverage as a result to the Oil & Gas transaction in 2013, the concerns about credit generally for natural resource companies is the fact that we have a very profitable mining business underlying all this that's going to give us the way forward for the future. We had over $19 million dollars of EBITDA in the fourth quarter \u2013 $900 million of EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2015. We've made significant reductions in our capital spending and we're continuing to review that. We've adjusted mine plans to improve cash flows. We've deferred our Oil & Gas drilling activities to conserve cash. We're engaged in strategic review about those assets, and we're looking at all alternatives including sales of the business, sales of assets, and how we might manage it going forward because of the market condition we're in. You'll see that we have reduced our copper and oil unit cost of production significantly. We've also and I want to comment about the success we've had with the Cerro Verde project; a project we wouldn't start today in these market conditions, but that's the nature of mining assets. We actually began to work on this expansion with Cerro Verde in 2010, a $4.6 billion project that we brought in without having a significant cost overrun, the world's largest concentrator facilities at a mine anywhere in the world, and it's come up without cost overrun at all in a very efficient \u2013 effective way and it will be a great long-term asset for our company going forward. We've taken steps to protect our balance sheet by suspending our dividend. We raised equity proceeds through two ATM initiatives that have generated $2 billion of equity for us. Now we're going to talk about further steps. As we look at restoring our balance sheet to reflect current market conditions, we're going to focus and manage our cost and capital and continue to generate cash flow in a safe way. We're going to take immediate steps to reduce debt to enhance shareholder value. We are in active discussions with a number of parties on alternatives for asset sales. Besides the review of the oil and gas business, we are looking at transaction involving a wide range of our copper assets that involve alternatives. But we have interested parties. We have great assets that could lead to sales or joint venture arrangements that will be important steps for dealing with our balance sheet. I mentioned in the oil and gas business, we're engaged in a review for that. Our board has hired Lazard as the board's financial advisor on that. Working together with our traditional banker, JPMorgan, we are canvassing the market to understand what the current market value is in an obviously tough market. And we are engaged with interested parties now who are being provided recent access to our year-end updates of our oil and gas reserve information in our various plants. We expect all of these to achieve progress that we'll be reporting to you as it occurs during the first half of 2016. Look at slide six to show what we've done with capital. The capital we spent in 2015, which reflected the Cerro Verde project's completion of a project, as I said, that started a number of years ago, but that is now completed. The oil and gas capital spending reflected plans and commitments for our drilling rig equipment and other support facilities that were structured during the time when we were planning on investing for growth in that business. And we're making adjustments that reduce capital spending for 2016 to $3.4 billion, and our plans for 2017 show capital dropping to $2.3 billion. The $1.5 billion for oil and gas reflects a couple of factors that we'll be carrying over in the early part of the year. We had some cash cost to pay for costs that were actually incurred last year. We are restructuring our drilling rig contracts. We are undertaking a plan to idle all three of the deepwater rigs. And so we will be seeing that spending dropping off markedly after midyear of this year. And you can see that by 2017, the CapEx will be down to $600 million. That excludes idle rig costs that we will be incurring for the commitments we have under these contracts, which we are negotiating how to arrange those with the drilling rig contractors. But excluded from the CapEx plans are $600 million of idle rig cost in 2016 and $400 million in 2017. These are going to be reflected as expenses in our income statement rather than as capital spending. So major reductions and continued focus on how to continue to restrain capital. We've adjusted our mine plans. We look at each one of our mines; we talked about this earlier. But we evaluate each of our mines with looking at a $2 copper price and considering sustaining capital. And we have made adjustments that aggregate roughly 350 million pounds, about 9% of our 2015 sales by adjusting production at four of our mines. We have stress-tested our current operating plans for our copper prices below $2 and developed contingency actions to take if the market weakens further. And we will be monitoring that on a day-by-day basis. Jim's doing a great job to do that. The facts are that we have such an attractive cost structure that we will generate cash flows \u2013 free cash flows out of our mining business even at much lower prices than $2. And we've taken these actions to preserve our very valuable significant long-term resources but while reducing near-term supply and generating cash flow. To show the results of these actions as it reflects in our unit cost, we look at slide eight, you can see on the chart that in 2015 our consolidated site production and delivery cost before by-product credits was $1.78. With our new plans, we are reducing our outlook for that for next year by 25% to $1.34. And when you take into account by-product credits, for gold at Grasberg, molybdenum in several of our mines, cobalt in Africa, you get down to a unit net cash cost even at these low commodity prices levels for by-products of $1.10 consolidated for our company going forward. We're doing this through aggressive cost and equipment fleet management in addition to curtailing high cost production. We get the benefits of scale at Cerro Verde. We have Grasberg's ore grades improving beginning in the second half of this year, as we execute our plan to complete mining in the open pit by the end of 2017, managing working capital, taking advantage of low input cost. Our oil and gas cash production cost are being reduced by nearly 20% and that reflects the fact that we're having increasing volumes from our gas (17:37) drilling work in the Gulf of Mexico where our unit costs are lower than in California, and also work that our oil and gas team is doing to take advantage of lower costs from contractors and being more efficient in general. More on our mining unit net cost presented on page nine, you can see this by region, where in the Americas, our before capital expenditure cost level is about $1.50 per pound. And in Indonesia, where costs are lower, reflecting the higher grade volumes that we have coming to us through our mine plan, the average is $1.10. And then after showing capital expenditures for sustaining capital, you can see that it averages $1.32. The Grasberg number includes the capital we're spending on underground development so that we have the underground mines available to continue Grasberg as a high-volume, low-cost, long-term operation after the completion of the mining of the open pit in 2017. So much talk about copper market commentary that I'm just going to make a couple of comments about it. Unquestionably, the uncertainty about the global economy is negatively impacting financial market sentiment. China's demand growth is slowing. Our Western demand is not as good as we and others had hoped it would be, but it's still expanding gradually. I'm not going to debate anyone about the market. The market is what the market is. But the facts are that in the copper business differs from other commodities in that there is not an enormous excess supply in inventories. We just show here the exchange stocks that's developed from the end of 2014 to the current date, similar story when you look at total global inventories. But here we have exchange stocks not rising significantly, remaining low by historical standards, at a time when the copper price has gone from $2.88 to $2 from the end of 2014 to the current date. It is \u2013 even looking at the decline in prices so dramatically since the third quarter, inventories are not building. The story is fundamentally, in today's world, the business we're seeing is not as negative as the financial markets are reacting to it. We have no particular insight as to what's going to happen in China in the future. We have to prepare ourselves for what the market is and the market is we've got $2 copper and we've got to react to it. To date, industry wide, there have been reduction in high-cost mines. Wood Mackenzie says 730,000 tons a year, there will be other cuts if prices stay at this level. The supply from new mines like Cerro Verde, like Morenci that began construction years ago are coming to an end now. The current level of balance in the marketplace is not yielding a surplus as high as people had predicted. And all the time, lower-grade ores are coming from existing mines. Mines are depleting. Mines are moving underground. All these things will lead to an ultimate price recovery, in my view, absent just a collapse in the world's economy because today's price is not high enough to incentivize any future development. So we have enormous resources. We're not going to be spending money on developing those resources until the market improves. And if we were to start today, if the price of copper were to magically jump to $4 a pound, it would be on the order of 10 years before new production could come out of our resources. So we remain confident about the long-term copper markets and dealing with the reality of today's low prices. Now, looking at just how good our copper business is, we talked about 2015 being a bridge year. Well, we crossed the bridge and now we're looking at a big uphill climb because of the current price. But even at current prices, our mining business at $2 yields $4.2 billion of EBITDA. And you can see that steps up, if we were to have higher prices and our CapEx and our mining business is $1.9 billion. So we have a company \u2013 we have a business that earns profits at low prices. We've cut back capital and we have that providing support for what we're doing. We have a great set of assets and we have five mines that have the potential of producing 1 billion pounds of copper per year. Three of them are already doing that : the Morenci, Cerro Verde, Grasberg mines. Tenke Fungurume has great growth opportunities, as does our El Abra mine in Chile. So we have a very attractive long-term set of assets to deal with. Quality assets, which gives us the opportunities to deal with the financing issues we face with our balance sheet. Very large reserves that I'm sure most of you know about. We've got 100 billion pounds of copper at $2 mine plans, adding in another like amount of mineralized material that's already been identified. As I said, that's there for our company for the long run. We're not going to be developing new projects until the market improves. Grasberg is a great asset. It is a very special asset with a high grade ore and copper and gold combined. And we have been working with the government of Indonesia in a challenging political environment in that country. We have a commitment from the government that was reflected in communication we received on October 7 from the Minister of Energy and Mines about our proposal to extend the primary term of our contract, which primary term of our 1991 contract goes to 2021. It gives us the rights to two 10-year extensions to 2041. We've been working with the government and we received the positive letter from the minister saying the government will grant approval for the contract and will preserve our rights in the same level of legal and fiscal certainty in the existing contract. We have recent reaffirmation of that commitment from senior government officials. The process going forward has been complicated by recent political developments in the country including the investigations related to the taped conversation with the former Speaker of the Indonesian parliament and the reviews by parliament of that and the investigation with it. But we remain confident and have support from senior government officials that their policy about extending our contract remains in place. The issue is when that happens and how the government deals with the existing regulations for extending contracts. And consistent with our agreement with the government \u2013 with the government's agreement to extend our contract and that we are advancing plans for the development of new smelting capacity with the government and with the vesting interest in our ownership of PTFI, we submitted recently a valuation in response to the government asking for that of our valuation of PTFI. And it reflected a valuation of approximately $16 billion, which reflects standard market ways of looking at values of mining assets. And we've agreed to offer, over time, 20.64% interest of PTFI to Indonesian ownership, whether that's the government state-owned companies, listing on the stock exchange, or sales to other Indonesian interest at fair market value. We've had ongoing discussions with the government on renewing our export license. Members \u2013 certain officials within the Ministry of Energy and Mines have suggested that we should continue to pay an export duty that we should make a sizable escrow deposit to support the smelter development. These points are inconsistent with the arrangements that we had worked with the government on beginning in mid-2014. And our discussions with the government continue. I'm here today to tell you that we have full confidence that the government will come up with a favorable decision and issue the export license to ensure the continuity of our mining operations. And in doing so, we'll serve the interest of Indonesia's mining industry in general. So that's the status. We have not, to-date, been given that export license, but we have confidence that we will. Now, turning to our oil and gas business, I want to reiterate things we've talked about in the past. These are very good assets that have valuable infrastructure and associated resources. We've had successful drilling activities since their acquisition by Freeport in mid-2013. And this successful drilling has de-risked the opportunities around the underutilized production facilities that we acquired in the transaction. We drilled 14 wells with positive results, four wells have been brought on production. And even though we are deferring drilling for the foreseeable future because of market conditions, the success we've had in past drilling would allow us to connect certain of these discoveries in a way that our near-term production volumes will actually be increasing because of the past drilling successes. Major property that we have an interest in Heidelberg, operated by Anadarko, produced its first oil this month and it will be ramping up as we go into 2016. We will also expect to place six additional wells on production from our own drilling in 2016. This will result, as I mentioned earlier, a reduction in our cash production cost to a consolidated of approximately $15 a barrel that reflects $10 a barrel in the Gulf of Mexico. We are deferring for the foreseeable future our exploration development activities. As I said, all three of our deepwater drilling rigs are being idled. Two are already idled and one is completing in the imminent future, in the immediate future, a completion activity that it's currently working on. But the business has very long-term production and development potential that will be there for the ultimate recovery in oil prices. There's a big inventory of drilling locations that will be available to create incremental value over the long period of time and that comes about because of our focus area in the deepwater where we have three major underutilized platforms : Marlin, Holstein and Horn Mountain where our recent tieback drilling has been done and where we've identified significant incremental drilling opportunities. We have interest in the Lucius and Heidelberg fields on non-operated basis and interest in the Vito area that has significant long-term development potential. On slide 18, we show what the EBITDA for this business would be generating and what the CapEx would be, excluding the idle rig cost. You can see that this business is very highly leveraged, of course, to the price of oil and can generate substantial free cash flows in the environment depending on the price of oil. We are planning our business not with an expectation that price increases will occur, but preserving values for an eventual recovery in prices. We're taking a very hard look at G&A cost as we go forward with this oil and gas review process. I've been working with Jim and his team in Houston. We're targeting a near term 30% reduction in G&A cost. And then, as we complete the oil and gas review process, we will assess the structure of our business at that time if, in fact, we don't sell the entire business. And then, we will organize the business to fit with what comes out of the oil and gas review process. Throughout our organization and with our team in Houston, I'm encouraged by the very positive and cooperative approach that all of our team is dealing with to deal with this price environment. Jim, do have anything you like to comment on? James C. Flores - Vice Chairman; President/CEO, Oil & Gas, Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, Richard, more just a continuation of the direction you're going with the call because with the Board of Directors and with Richard's guidance and help working through the process of the 70% drop in crude oil, we brought CapEx 70% when you go 2014 through 2017, as you see pro forma. And we're going to right size to reflect the LOEs to the new environment, lease operating expenses as well G&A, as you mentioned. And then also, on top of that, as per the Board of Directors instructions, were also fully manned to support the strategic review process as we get third parties to evaluate the assets, and go forward, to give the board a view of \u2013 a clear look at what evaluation is of the oil and gas business currently and, go forward, we make the right decision at FCX. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks a lot, Jim. Let's go to slide 19 and update our outlook for 2016. Copper sales at 5.1 billion pounds. And you can see gold, molybdenum and oil at 57.6 million barrels equivalent, 74% of which is oil. Unit cost, we talked about earlier, at $2 copper that would generate $3.4 billion of operating cash flows including the impact of idle rig cost. We got significant leverage to copper, of course, and we've reviewed capital expenditures. In looking at our sales profile, going into 2016 and 2017, you can see the level of copper sales, which reflects Cerro Verde, Grasberg's positive results and continued operations at our existing mines, net of our curtailed production. And you can see in 2017, as we complete mining the Grasberg open pit the significant volumes of gold that will be produced. And looking at the bottom of the slide, with oil and gas sales, even with the suspension of drilling activities, because of our past drilling successes and completing the tieback wells, we're not seeing a falloff in our oil and gas sales profile. 21 shows EBITDA cash flow numbers at various prices. At $2, this is the average of 2016-2017. $5 billion of EBITDA at $2, $3 billion of operating cash flow. And you can see our leverage to higher prices, and I again want to emphasize, we are also stress testing our business to respond to a scenario where prices may go lower. Looking at our debt levels, this is the focus of what we have to deal with, and we have to deal with it in today's marketplace. We have total debt at the end of December of just over $20 billion. We have adequate liquidity, as we go forward. We have very limited amounts, $200 million of debt maturing in 2016. We have no funds drawn under our $4 billion bank credit facility. I'm sure you all have followed the rating actions taken on our company and have also followed the rating agency's public comment about their broadly based reviews of credits in the metals and mining and energy sector. We have worked with agencies over the year to demonstrate our commitment to protecting our balance sheet, and we'll continue to do so. In light of the recent ratings actions and the sentiments by the rating agencies, we have prepared contingency plans to address our financial assurance obligations for our mining properties under a scenario where we're not investment-grade rated. We would develop plans that would allow us to address these in a fashion that would either not require or minimize using letters of credit under our bank credit facilities and we have a number of alternatives for doing that. So, we're working to come up with plans to reduce debt, to get our balance sheet stronger and improve our financial flexibility and protect our liquidity in the short run. So, we are \u2013 start out telling you we're serious and we are serious and focused to take advantage of our large scale current production base of resources. We've established these long lived reserves that are going to be there for the future of our company, and we have significant underdeveloped resources that will be available for the future. We're very proud and pleased to represent a global organization of such highly-qualified management, workers and people that we work with, they're first class in every respect. Our mining business, we've shown generates free cash flows at very low prices and we're taking prudent management steps and will continue to do so to respond to these market conditions. We are going to address our asset, our balance sheet debt levels through asset sales, other initiatives to raise capital, and we have the assets to do that. And throughout all of this, throughout all of this, we're going to have a positive outlook for our company based on the long-term global demand and supply fundamentals for the commodities that we produced and given our high-quality asset base. I know you have a lot of questions and I look forward to responding to them. Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Operator, we'll take questions now. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. I just have a couple of quick questions. First of all, on a near-term basis, there's been some chatter lately about the \u2013 in the press, anyway, about the pending export license situation in Indonesia. There's some indication that Indonesia is requiring a deposit towards the smelter construction in order to renew the license for the next six months. And I was wondering if that is correct. And if so, where does that stand? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : The press is accurate in reporting that the Director General in Mining has raised that as a potential condition for getting our export license that there'd be a substantial deposit. We have responded that our view that that's inconsistent with the understanding we had with the government that we had made a commitment to progress the smelter project and we fulfilled that commitment to progress it. We have sites developed for it. We're working with our current partner in the Gresik smelter that we developed in the mid-1990s, that Gresik, Mitsubishi who will work with us as we're going forward. We're working with the contractor to do it. Our position is that we've met our obligations to the government. We developed an engineering procurement contract with Chiyoda, the Japanese engineering firm. And so, we are engaged in discussions with the government about that. And as I said, we have, as Freeport's management, full confidence that we're going to be able to get our export permit extended on mutually agreeable terms with the government. David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Okay. I'll leave it at that for now. Just a clarification question on some of the numbers this quarter versus the last quarter. Specifically, the idled rig costs, were the $600 million of expected idle rig cost in 2016 and $400 million in 2017, were those numbers previously included in the previous oil and gas CapEx or are those new expected cash outflows? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. The cost of the rigs under the plans that we had in place at the third quarter were included in capital expenditures. We are engaged in discussions with the owners of those rigs, the other party to our contracts, in terms of restructuring the terms of the contracts in view of our new plan to idle all three of those rig cost. And what we've included in our estimate of idled rig cost is our expectation as to how these negotiations will be completed. They're not yet completed, but this is our expectation. It involves two things. One, a transfer of the amounts we pay to the drilling contractor under what we believe will be revised terms out of CapEx into idled rig cost. And then, we are taking also out of CapEx the cost of operating those rigs because our plans previously included a continuation of drilling activity. So, we're seeing not new cost, but restructured lower cost as a result of our plan to idle all three of the deepwater rigs. David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. All right. So if CapEx in oil and gas went down, versus December, it went down by $300 million but there was $600 million taken out, am I reading it the wrong way that that implies there's a $300 million increase somewhere else in CapEx or is that not how I should be thinking about that? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : This all reflects our \u2013 we've restructured our plans, idle the rig cost, completing the wells that we could complete near-term to keep our production off, and most of those costs are early in 2016. So, it reflects our new plan to complete the wells that were available for completion, to suspend, stop drilling for new activities and what you're seeing is the net impact of those revised plans. David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Yu with Citi. Please go ahead. Brian Hsien Yu - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Thanks. Hey, Richard, in the beginning of the call you mentioned about how you had cut back on your copper output last year in response to market conditions and I'm just wondering, on the oil and gas side, with California and the cost laid out, it seems from someone on the outside that it's EBITDA and cash flow negative. Can you talk about those operations specifically and maybe there are other factors that we're not really taking into consideration for why you're continuing to run it? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we're continuing to run it because even with the level of operating cost by constraining capital it is cash flow positive for us and it preserves the asset. Jim, why don't you comment on our strategy and plans for California? James C. Flores - Vice Chairman; President/CEO, Oil & Gas, Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah, Brian. That's a correct assessment when you look on historical cost basis and we look on a cost-forward basis of what we're doing on the LOE cost and fuel going down and so forth that we see a 20%, 25% reduction on LOE cost. Granted, we're not making a lot of money at $30 a barrel but we are not losing money in California on an LOE as-produced basis as we go forward through the year. There'll be a quarter where they'll be a negative. There'll be a quarter it will be a positive. So, we'll continue to maintain production out there if oil stays around $30, just to maintain the price upside option as long as it don't cost FCX any money. If oil goes to $20 obviously, you know, sustaining and so forth that would be a different ball game. We'll revisit your issue. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And Brian, also I want to mention, we have shut in the offshore production in Point Arguello... James C. Flores - Vice Chairman; President/CEO, Oil & Gas, Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : ...which we had the ability to do that. And that was high cost. It's not a huge part of our production but it was a high-cost segment of our production. Brian Hsien Yu - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): All right. Okay. Apologies, I'm not, as you know, with the oil and gas business but in the presentation slide it says operating costs in California are $33 per barrel. What's the difference between that and LOE? Are there some non-cash items in there? James C. Flores - Vice Chairman; President/CEO, Oil & Gas, Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah. LOE and operating costs are basically the same thing. But operating costs also captures development activity like workovers and things of that nature which are production-sustaining operations which help build LOE. If you stop working over every well then you just get down to the base LOE, which is your \u2013 all your cost to run the oil fields without any capital investment. So, you drop those development activity and that's before any CapEx. And then, I'm just strictly on the LOE basis, you continue to cost, you manage your chemicals, you manage your trucking, you manage your employee levels and compensation and so forth to where they make sure the oil field continues to produce at least break even. You don't want to lose money producing oil at this point in time. And what Richard talked about in the Point Arguello, so forth, that's in the historical numbers. So, we see a reduction now in the low $20s of LOE by $22 to $22.50 a barrel on California going forward. And that's why $30 a barrel it will justify continuing to produce. Say, at $20 a barrel it would be another story so that \u2013 we hope they don't get to that point but you never know. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Essentially, what we have Brian is an operation out there at current levels of oil prices that's close to breakeven. But it is from terms of the value of that asset, it is highly, highly leveraged, of course, to oil prices and relatively small increases in the price of oil results in generating substantial values in that asset. So, it's a great asset for people who have an optimistic view about oil price recoveries, and we're reading more about that in today's marketplace. And so, it's an asset that today we can manage without losing money but preserving that value opportunity either for ourselves and for our buyer of the company. Brian Hsien Yu - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. And then just a good question on the potential copper sales. Are there assets that you would consider kind of core and important to FCX's DNA or is it a situation more or like, perhaps, for the right price and you would consider any operation? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We would consider any operation and are considering any operation, every one of our assets are. Our objective is to respond to this market condition, respond to our balance sheet situation and find the place of where we can generate the most value to achieve that objective while preserving a business that's going to be valuable for our shareholders as we go forward. So, we are considering \u2013 we've talked about Grasberg, where we have this agreement to sell an additional 20% interest in a very valuable asset there, and we're looking at our assets across the board. We're finding that, as I feel, there are people in the marketplace who are taking a longer term view of the copper markets in a positive way. And we're engaged in active discussions with people on a number of alternative overlapping possibilities. I know everyone would like to be more specific now. I would like to be more specific now. The situation has developed in a negative way very quickly and aggressively, and we're responding to it. And we will report to you at a time when we can be more specific. But today, we can't. Brian Hsien Yu - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): All right. Thanks and good luck. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, everyone. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Tony. Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: I've got a couple questions here. Richard, my first question is, obviously, you mentioned a big uphill climb and obviously very serious challenges that the company is facing. Is the intention to return FCX to a pure play in copper and gold, ultimately, if you can get out from underneath, all of what you're dealing with right now? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, as I said, our strategic focus is around our mining business, so that's going to be the focus. We are looking to see what market opportunities we have available to us with our oil and gas asset to generate value, and we're going to assess how to do that either near term or over time. I mean, we are not going to make irrational decisions based on just current market conditions. But we have a number of interested parties who are anxious to talk with us about how we might go forward with it. But our strategic focus for the company is clear. That was established back in our October timeframe. We talked about restructuring our board. The strategic focus of our company is on our copper and related minerals businesses. Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And some follow-up questions here. So, from your comments, I mean, it sounds like you're not averse to selling certain mining assets in their entirety. Is that a fair assessment? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We are going to find the best opportunity to achieve our goals. And if that involves that sale of assets in their entirety, we will do that. Now, it's just where the company is. It's not something \u2013 we don't like selling equity at these prices. We don't like selling assets that we know are going to be valuable in the long run. But we have a big portfolio of assets, a big portfolio of reserves, and that's what's going to give us the chance to deal with this current problem and come out of this as a profitable company that's going to be of long-term values for our shareholders. So, we're going to be measuring how to deal with the balance sheet issues and how to create long-term value from a sized-down business to deal with the near-term problems. Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Just a question on this is... Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We have the assets to do it. Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Just a follow up on the offshore rigs, and I think you guys have had contracts with Rowan and Noble, and those contracts have been costing about, maybe $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion a year, I believe that's been the case. And I think that was going into what I think the middle of 2017, if I recall correctly. But you are now including \u2013 you are telling us that you are assuming now that you'll have a successful outcome with those two companies regarding those contracts. Is that correct? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. We still have the contracts, and we're going to live up to our contractual obligations, okay. Now, what we're doing is, when you operate these deepwater rigs, you have to pay the drilling contractor and those have been in the range of $500,000 to $600,000 a day, and then you incur, in past times, a similar amount in operating them. So, our plan now, eliminate the cost of operating them as the rigs will be idled, and we're negotiating with the drilling rig companies to reduce our near-term financial obligations in some mutually-accepted way that recognizes the value the contractors have in the contract and they're working with us to be responsive to our desires to reduce near-term cash requirements. Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : But Tony, the numbers \u2013 this is Kathleen. The numbers that you were using included the spread and that's what's being removed. So, even though we're having to pay and satisfy these contractual obligations, we are reducing our overall cost by idling the rigs and not incurring additional cost to other contractors. And so, that's the objective here is to conserve cash. And as we've talked about, we benefit from having an inventory of wells already drilled. And so, we don't have to continue drilling and incurring the additional costs. And so, what we solve for is how do we get the best cash flow answer in this environment. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. I'm sorry... Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And Tony, these are tough... Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes, Richard. Sorry. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : These are tough decisions. Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Absolutely. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I mean these are the best drilling rigs in the world. We've got attractive prospects to drill and because of market conditions and our company's financial position, we're having to take these really tough decision to idle these, just like we're having to make really tough decisions about selling interest in our mining properties. I mean, we are where we are. We can't wish the market away. We can't wish this debt away. We've got to deal with it, and that's the hard decisions that we're making. Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Understood. Just \u2013 I want to go back to Indonesia. Obviously, it's very critical to your success overall in getting those costs down to the $1.10 level. And I'm wondering \u2013 it's hard for us on this side of the world and all the statements that come out of the press and what may be factual, what may not be factual, but it makes it very, very difficult and the uncertainty as you expressed. And I'm wondering, with all of these stuff that's going on, I mean is there any risk to these numbers which are back-end loaded in 2016 because it is a critical part of the success for the mining company going forward? How would you \u2013 and you're spending, what, about $800 million, $900 million a year there right now? Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Right. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. On that order, yeah. I mean, it's really important to us. Indonesia has been a interesting, complicated country to work in over the 40 years that we've been there. And we've been through lots of changes, about as many changes as you can imagine with a country. And we have successfully managed our way through those changes over 40 years. It's important to us, but please remember, this is important to Indonesia. I mean, where we operate in Papua, which is a challenging political, socio-economic region of Indonesia that's important to the country strategically, in our area where we employ over 30,000 workers, we represent, in the province we work in, over 90% of their economy. The taxes, the employment, the exports that we generate for the country of Indonesia is important to the country as a whole. Like all countries around the world and all developing countries in Asia, Indonesia is being challenged by the downturn in China and the global economy, and so we're important to them as they are important to us. And Indonesia, today, is a true democracy where there's a freedom of the press and political figures are free to comment on it. That's a good thing. And some of the comments reflect, as we see around the world and to a significant degree here in the United States, a feeling of nationalism. Witness (01:00:41) comments that are made about free trade here in the United States. And so what you're reading is the functioning of a democratic system where people have views about nationalism. Underlying that is a company that's been a long-term investor in Indonesia that has plans to make significant investments in developing the underground resources that we have there that provides employment and economic benefits to a province that is in very much of need of development as Papua and as a country that's in need of this. And so we have a mutual need for each other. It's a mutual need and that's what's going to lead us to finding a resolution of these issues that's mutually acceptable to both sides. And we're doing this in a positive way. Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Richard, assuming you're able to go on that path and get that resolution you need, which obviously is required, can you give us comfort that looking out beyond 2017 -- I know you've not really talked about that a whole lot, but you've presented it in your slide deck where the production does come off as you are involved in the transition to underground. Can you give us further comfort about that transition and might it be a less steep drop-off post 2017 at this point in time? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, Tony, you've been working with us for so many years. You will recall that, you go back a number of years and that drop-off was much more steep then than it is now, we've had great success in expanding our ore bodies there. In the third quarter, we began producing from the deep MLZ mine, which is an extension of our underground block-caving operations that started in the early 1980s. This is the most recent significant extension to it. It's very high grades of copper and gold, a very long life. That mine has come up to speed very efficiently. We are progressing with our underground development for the Grasberg underground ore to the block cave mine plants that we have. We're stockpiling ore to produce beyond 2017. This is where we are currently with our plans is what you see, as you say, in the slide deck. And Mark Johnson and his team, with our team at jobsite, is working every day to see how we can minimize the impact of that transition. But it is a reality. It is a reality that there will be a transition because we can't begin mining the Grasberg underground ore body until we complete mining the pit, because the pit subsides and the ground falls in on the cave, so you physically can't do it. And yet, we're taking every step we can to mitigate that increase. That was one of our reasons for developing Cerro Verde. That was one of our reasons for developing Tenke and Morenci, was to drive volumes for us during that time period when we were making the transition to Grasberg. So what you see today is our best estimate of where we are. We're going to work to do our dead level best to improve that. We've had success in the past of doing that. We've got a great team working on it. And that's what we're working on. Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, Richard. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : But we're very confident technically about our ability to do it. This organization has operated the most complex mine in the world, and I feel comfortable in saying that and I think the rest of the mining industry would agree with it, at 13,000 feet in the middle of Papua where it rains, absent El Ni\u00f1o, 200 inches to 400 inches a year, where we mine the pit, we mine the underground, we can do this. So technically, we're very comfortable and we're confident about working in Indonesia where we've been for over 40 years. It's complicated. I'm not going to underestimate the complications. But you got a team here that can handle it. Anthony Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, Richard. I appreciate that. Thank you very much. Good luck with everything, too. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Tony. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sussman with Clarkson. Please go ahead. Jeremy Ryan Sussman - Clarkson Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Thanks very much for taking the question. You talked in your prepared remarks and in the press release, I guess, about the physical copper market being close to imbalance. And you guys have certainly taken some proactive steps and you especially did so, I guess, in the financial crisis when you took down production by a decent amount. On one hand, all of your even higher cost operations are still nicely free cash flow positive. On the other hand, you've got the potential ability, I guess, to influence the market. So how do you sort of balance the two, let's say, if copper prices stay around the $2 range where they're currently at? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, Jeremy, you're very accurate in pointing out that we generate cash from our business there, and we need this cash. I mean, we need to reduce our debt levels. So we've adjusted it so far to take out the production that's not cash flow positive or marginally cash flow positive at the $2 level. And so with unit cost consolidated average $1.10 that reflects Grasberg, as Tony pointed out, but you look at our other properties in the Americas, that average is about $1.50 a pound, that generates substantial cash, which is something we need. But if this market deteriorates, if the worst predictions for China are true in terms of its economy shrinking and its demand for copper shrinks, then we have the assets that we'll further adjust to that. But at a $2 price level, we're where we need to be. Jeremy Ryan Sussman - Clarkson Capital Markets LLC : Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And just real quickly, you talked about evaluating alternatives for the Oil & Gas business. Again, obviously, maybe even a more difficult environment on Oil & Gas. What are several alternatives that you're looking at in the current environment? Thank you. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thanks, Jeremy. What we're looking at is reviewing and canvassing the market. We're making data available, we're making our management team available to discuss our assets to parties that might be interested in buying the business or might be interested in buying assets as part of the business. As you point out, it's a difficult marketplace. And yet, and I was listening to comments coming out of Davos and out of the financial community, this low oil price is ultimately going to have an impact on the level of oil that's being produced globally. It's putting pressure on producers here in the United States, but also producers in countries around the world. So ultimately, low prices will have an impact on supplies. And there are people out there who are making comments about how attractive it is to invest in natural resources at this point in the marketplace. So we're going to find out what the interests are, and it's a wide range of activities. We're not going to do anything dumb with these assets because we know what their values are and what their leverage to prices are. We're going to manage our balance sheet and, again, approach it in a way that creates long-term value for our shareholders. Jeremy Ryan Sussman - Clarkson Capital Markets LLC : Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead. Christopher Domenic Mancini - GAMCO Asset Management, Inc.: Hi. Thanks a lot. Just regarding Tony's question about, and what you were saying, Richard, about the $500,000 a day to $600,000 a day of lease cost, to what degree could you just put that back to Noble and the other contractors? Or do you have to spend that $500,000 a day to $600,000 a day even if the rigs are idle and not pumping? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Well, let me take that in two steps. First of all, what we have signed are standard contracts for the offshore drilling industry. These are contracts that we had entered into that are similar to contracts that all other operators have entered into. And if you read, you can find that there are a number of other operators who are also idling rigs and doing this. So we can't get out of the contracts. I mean, they are what they are. They're standard. They have obligations that we have entered into. These contractors, as a company, we honor our contracts. So we start with that. We can't just get out of \u2013 we can't just... Christopher Domenic Mancini - GAMCO Asset Management, Inc.: Okay. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : ...not pay them because we want to. Christopher Domenic Mancini - GAMCO Asset Management, Inc.: Okay. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Now, what we're doing is minimizing the cost, given our contractual obligations. We're doing that, one, by idling the rigs, which involves the spread cost that we incur when the rigs are operating. And two, we're entering into negotiations with the contractor companies to mitigate the near-term cash obligations that we have in ways that we can mutually agree to that's in the benefit of both companies. And we have positive relationships and we want to maintain positive relationships with these contractors. They're very good companies. They're people that are \u2013 whoever operates this business in the long run is going to want to have good relationships with them. They want to have good relationships with us. They have very high quality rigs. And so it gives us a basis for talking with them, which they're doing, to try to achieve our objectives in ways that's consistent with their rights under the contract. Christopher Domenic Mancini - GAMCO Asset Management, Inc.: Okay. Okay. So, I guess, that kind of answers my second question, which was \u2013 I mean, in terms of the ability, at one point, if the price of oil does decline more, do you \u2013 can you make the decision to just put the business on care and maintenance, so to speak, the oil and gas business on care and maintenance? What kind of \u2013 like, what's the analysis there in terms of when you can still perhaps maintain the optionality of the business but not burn as much cash? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's what we're doing. Christopher Domenic Mancini - GAMCO Asset Management, Inc.: Okay. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : In some respect, that's what we're doing right now. I mean, we're taking these drilling rigs and idling them to save cost. We're preserving this inventory of prospects for future drilling when market conditions warrant. We're maximizing cash that we get out of production by bringing on-stream some successful wells that we've drilled to keep our production levels up. We're cutting lease operating expenses that Jim talked about. We're reducing G&A. So we're doing what you call care and maintenance. And as you see, by 2017, we get our CapEx down to $600 million where it was $3 billion plus. So what you're saying this is what we're doing. Christopher Domenic Mancini - GAMCO Asset Management, Inc.: All right. Okay. And then I was going to say even in extreme scenario where if you can't sell the business, you don't have the ability to place any FCX debt on the oil and gas business and then, say, even declare \u2013 file for bankruptcy for the oil and gas business and then you could get rid of some liabilities potentially and also get rid of these idle rig costs and just have again the mining business, which we had in the past. Because my understanding, again, is that all the liabilities are \u2013 they are obligations of FCX corporate, right? You can't place liabilities \u2013 there are no liabilities that are just on the oil and gas business. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Just think about this, Chris. Christopher Domenic Mancini - GAMCO Asset Management, Inc.: Yes. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : There's absolutely no way you can transfer debt to an entity and then declare a bankruptcy for it. Christopher Domenic Mancini - GAMCO Asset Management, Inc.: Right. Right. Right. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You just can't do that. And we have a business, since oil and gas business has a lot of value. Christopher Domenic Mancini - GAMCO Asset Management, Inc.: Right. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And so \u2013 and that value is now owned by FCX as the owner of those assets. And we need to manage FCX's debt level and preserve the values that have been created. Now, the values are less now than they were two-and-a-half years ago because oil price have gone from over $100 to $30, just like our copper assets. The value that we put on ETFI, which is $16 billion reflecting today's market is a lot less than it was when copper prices were $3 or more. So we've got to recognize realities, but in the midst of all \u2013 and I said this earlier \u2013 in the midst of all of this noise about negative investor sentiment, about commodities in China and global growth, and in the midst of all the concerns about Freeport because of our debt level in Indonesia, we've got a great set of assets underlying this. And that's going to be our salvation and our opportunity to create a recovery and value for the future. That's why I'm still working here. I'm still invested in FCX stock and all of our team is as well. So that's what we're going to do. Christopher Domenic Mancini - GAMCO Asset Management, Inc.: Right. Right. No, I would definitely agree that the mining business has a lot of, lot of value. We like the mining assets a lot. Thanks a lot. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Murphy with UBS. Please go ahead. Matt Murphy - UBS Securities Canada, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. I have another question on asset sales, an issue people have been consistently asking me about. I agree, on the asset front, there's a lot of value there. But the question is regarding the ability to sell assets as it relates to your bond indentures and any restrictions that might exist on asset sales. Can you provide any thoughts on whether or not that's something you are needing to consider as you evaluate alternatives? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : The bonds were issued as investment-grade rated company and they don't have restrictions. We recently restructured our bank credit facility so that we've agreed that half of any asset sales we have will be used to reduce debt. Practicality of it is we're going to use proceeds from asset sales to reduce debt. I mean, that's just what \u2013 that's why we're doing it. So there's not any real restriction now. We'll have to deal with our financial situation going forward. But the whole purpose of asset sales is to reduce debt. We're not going to be restoring investment activities until we solve the balance sheet problem and until market conditions improve. Matt Murphy - UBS Securities Canada, Inc.: Okay. That makes sense. And you also mentioned just making tough decisions and including, you said, issuing equity. I'm just wondering if there's any thoughts on whether the board would consider another at-the-market equity program. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we're looking at all alternatives. We've completed these last two rounds. It goes without saying, none of us want to issue equity at these levels, none of us want to sell assets in this market, but we have to do what we have to do. And we're looking with our banks at what access to capital market transactions, private market transactions we might have. A lot of this is driven by our progress on our asset sales. And I'm encouraged by the opportunities that are emerging for us. So there's got to be a holistic answer to it, and we have to keep all options open. But at the present time, we're focused on what kind of opportunities we have in the asset sale joint venture arena. Matt Murphy - UBS Securities Canada, Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): I've got a couple of questions as well. I was wondering if you could quantify what your debt reduction target might be. Or perhaps you can give a range like you're looking to sort of reduce net debt in the sort of $3 billion to $5 billion range or we're just trying to get a sense of how many assets could be sold if the pricing makes sense in this environment. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : $5 billion to $10 billion is our target. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): $5 billion to $10 billion. Okay. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's not something we won't be able to do in one transaction. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): Sure. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And it's not going to be something we do. I'm not giving you a specific timeframe on it. We're going to make significant progress, I believe, in the first half of the year, but we need to get our debt down over time into that range. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): Okay. So, $5 billion to $10 billion through multiple transactions would be your target? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Correct. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And in terms of your exposure, your financial exposure, if your credit is downgraded from investment grade, I know you're looking at alternatives to posting letters of credit. But could you give us a sense of what your maximum cash exposure would be that would potentially eat into your $4 billion credit line availability? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We believe we have opportunities to deal with this in a way that would not eat into our line of credit. And we're working on those structures now and I don't want to go because of the state of analysis and considerations, but we've come up with some creative ideas about how to fulfill our obligations, which we will do. We're going to fulfill our obligations to states and the federal government, but we believe we can do it in a way that will preserve our credit facility, the availability on our credit facility. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): Well, could you give us a sense that if for some reason those alternatives did not come to fruition what the financial exposure would be from a liquidity perspective? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. It's not so much a specific amount that gets triggered all at one point in time. Kathleen, you want to comment on this? Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Yeah. I was going to say, Orest, it's in the $500 million range currently, and it's something that the states review on an ongoing basis along with the company to look at what those ultimate closure obligations are. So it's not a static number, but that's the approximate level currently. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's wonderful, thank you. And then just finally, just changing gears in terms of the assets. Can you give us a sense of if water issues are still impacting Grasberg? I know you had sort of alluded to that coming into the fourth quarter. And sort of how you see that playing out through 2016? And I was also wondering about Cerro Verde, whether you have all the water you need there to ramp up the expansion this year. Thank you. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. We'll have Mark Johnson speak about Grasberg. Mark is our executive who's the President of our operations there. So, Mark? Mark J. Johnson - President & Chief Operating Officer \u2013 Indonesia: Yeah. The El Ni\u00f1o effect that we talked or hear about so much, it affected us definitely in 2015. That started to relax for us as far as daily rainfall in December. And so far in 2016, we haven't had any constraints with the water. We've had normal rainfall return back, like I said, in mid-December and this continued through January. We don't expect that we're going to see, and none of our numbers include, any sort of constraints because of the lack of water. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And Red Conger is here who manages our business in the Americas and in Africa, and Red's recently been to Peru, and can talk to you about our water situation there. Harry \u201cRed\u201d Conger - President & Chief Operating Officer \u2013 Americas and Africa Mining : Yeah, Orest, in the El Ni\u00f1o pattern, that part of the country is drier than it normally is. This is typically the rainy season there now and it hasn't really started raining yet. We've had a storm or two up in the mountains. The water levels right now in the reservoirs are roughly the same as they were last year, so we don't see a shortage yet. But it needs to rain and it hasn't rained yet. We've not been impacted to this point. So we're cautiously optimistic that we'll still get some rain this year. But to this point, we have not. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And the water access that we've had for Cerro Verde is coming from this wastewater collection and treatment system that we built for the city of Arequipa. So it's providing a source of water for our expanded operations. The El Ni\u00f1o effect is giving concerns to farmers in the area, and that's caused some, let me say, discussions with us and with the city about our water access. And while we have to deal with that, the long-term solution for water at Cerro Verde has been a very innovative and successful one of working cooperatively with the community in Arequipa. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): Okay. So, at this point, it doesn't sound like you're concerned you're going to be water constrained in either operation this year? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's correct. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you very much. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : Thank you for all your actions and tough work in the tough time. Concerning the $5 billion to $10 billion asset sale target, does that include the proceeds from selling a 10% or 20% slug of Grasberg? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : And other than Grasberg, are there other mining assets for sale with the asset sales focused more on the Oil & Gas assets that are not as positive cash flow generative? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it does include consideration of potential sales of oil and gas assets whether they're cash flow or not. It considers that. John, the point I was trying to make and I hope I got across is we have a number of alternatives. In fact, we're looking at all of our assets across the company's board to see how can we generate cash to reduce debt and how we can preserve values for long-term shareholders. So every one of our assets are being considered. And we are going to understand the market's interest, we're going to understand where we can find transactions and including potential for capital markets transactions that might involve placements of various types of securities. But we're looking across the board how can we achieve these two goals in the best fashion, how can we deal with our balance sheet, how we can come out of that with a company that can be there with significant cash flows, development opportunities for the long-run business. I know you would like and I would like to know exactly how we're going to do that, but the market is such that I can't tell you right now. But I can tell you, our commitment to it in our across-the-board consideration of alternatives. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : Thank you. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, John. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hey. Good morning, everybody. So... Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: ...I wanted to quickly follow up on Indonesia. And in the press release, you've stated, I believe, that the timing of the capital expenditures continue to be reviewed. And I wondered if you could maybe give us an update on what is encompassed in this review and the potential reductions or options that we could be looking at. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We've been working very closely with Mark and his team to defer all the capital we can defer, and we've come up with some adjustments to mine plans and restructuring approaches to the long-term development of the resources, and that's reflected in our current plans. We are continuing with our investments to develop the underground ore bodies, the access to them and to prepare the Grasberg block cave for bringing it on stream beginning in roughly 2018 \u2013 beginning of 2018. So the review process is that's predicated on our ability to continue to export concentrate. So the current discussions we have about getting an extension for that export is important to those decisions to continue to invest. As I said, we are presently very confident that we are going to get this export permit arranged for us. But if there was any aspects of our work with the Government of Indonesia that would change that, then unfortunately we'd be forced to curtail development activities, curtail employment, take actions to preserve our company. We don't expect that to happen, but those are the sorts of things that were referenced in terms of the comment you saw about reviewing. Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: That's helpful. Thank you. And then along the same lines, maybe a quick follow-up on the smelter development. Richard, in the past, you've added some details regarding potential partners for the smelter. Could you give us an update on that? What do you expect, at this point in time, to be Freeport's contribution to the smelter? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, as this thing is progressing, we're looking at what the capital costs would be, what are the potential sources of outside financing for that, and we're engaged in discussions with banks on that. To get financing, we have to have the contract extension done and we advised the government of that. And then potential partners would include our joint venture partner in Grasberg, it would include the operator of the project as potential. So that is still a work in progress. Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: All right. Well, good luck and thanks for that color. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you for your question. And thank everyone for your interest in the company and all the questions that you have. And we look forward to reporting progress on this plan as we go into 2016 further. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Our results released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the conference call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today\u2019s press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. I\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2015 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer; we also got Red Conger here, and Mark Johnson. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to our presentation materials on our website. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for Q&A. Today, FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $4.2 billion, $3.35 per share for first quarter of 2016. The loss included net charges totaling $4 billion or $3.19 per share primarily for the reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties, idle rig costs and other items. After adjusting for the net special items the first quarter adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $197 million or $0.16 per share. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the first quarter approximated $873 million and there is a reconciliation of that amount on Page 32 of our slide deck. Consolidated sales totaled $1.1 billion pounds of copper during the quarter just over 200,000 ounces of gold, $17 million pounds of molybdenum and $12.1 million barrels of oil equivalents. Our realized price for copper during the first quarter was $2.17 per pound that was below last year\u2019s first quarter average of $2.72 per pound. Gold prices were slightly above last year\u2019s average. In the first quarter of 2016, our gold prices averaged $1,227 per ounce. And our realized price for crude oil during the first quarter of 2016 was $29 per barrel that was significantly below last year's first quarter price of $44.54 per barrel which included about $12 per barrel and realized gains on derivative contracts. We reported very good cost performance during the quarter and are on track to meet or exceed our cost guidance for the year. The average cost of production net of by-product credits for our copper mines averaged $1.38 per pound in the first quarter of 2016. Those were lower than last year's first quarter of a $1.64. We had the benefit of volume and also the impact of our ongoing cost reduction initiative. Our average cost of a $1.38 was below the estimate we provided in January of 2016 of $1.44 per pound. We generated operating cash flows totaling $740 million in the first quarter and capital expenditures were just under $1.982 billion during the quarter. We ended the quarter with $20.8 billion in debt and our consolidated cash was $331 million. Richard is going to be talking on this call about our efforts to reduce debt significantly and our progress on our asset sale program. We ended the quarter with availability under our revolver totaling $3 billion at quarter end and at the end of the quarter we had $1.25 billion common shares outstanding. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the materials in our slide presentation. Richard Adkerson : Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on our first quarter earnings call. It's been a very active and encouraging quarter for us here at Freeport. We are just mailing out our annual report and the theme of it\u2019s \u201cProving our Mettle\u201d that\u2019s the ability to face a demanding situation in a spirited and resilient way. And I can tell you our team here couldn\u2019t be approaching its work in a more positive way from that standpoint. I\u2019m very proud of all that our team is doing. We have a clearly defined strategy that our Board has set and we are really focused on executing it now. We experienced strong operating results in the face of weak commodity prices and we made a lot of progress in achieving our strategic and financial objectives during this quarter. Our reported earnings were in line with our plans, actually a bit higher because we had somewhat higher copper prices during the quarter. We did have a significant additional impairment charge, which was substantially all in our oil and gas business and we have taken recent steps to restructure that business to reduce costs and that is progressing well. We got a really good operating team there and some good assets and we are focused on attacking cost aggressively and have begun to do that. We are continuing to look for opportunities to sell or monetize assets in the oil and gas business, but we are now working with \u2013 and this is a tough market, admittedly a tough market to try to do that. But we are working with our operating team on new plans to preserve and enhance value of our assets for the future. With our mining business, we are performing well. The Cerro Verde startup is proceeding exceptionally well and we will talk a bit more about that. Mining CapEx are declining as we\u2019ve been talking about in the past. Volumes are increasing. Costs are being constrained, and copper prices have risen from the lows in the face of an admittedly uncertain global market, but there has been positive movements recently. We are continuing with our efforts to improve our balance sheet and have increasing confidence that we are going to be able to do that in effective way and after we get our balance sheet situation developed, we are going to have a \u2013 continue to have an industry-leading copper Company and we remain very positive about it\u2019s long-term fundamentals. With the copper market itself the initial benefit came of course from monetary policies to encourage business activity in China and dovish positioned by the U.S. Fed initially created more positive environment for copper and other commodities prices, but recent data at China\u2019s internal economy has been encouraging in the power grid business automobiles, but recognized that it is a mix situation there, its construction remains subdued, but there is improved market sentiment, short positions have been closed, long positions have been taken which is just a function of the marketplace, and globally demand is improving modestly. So what\u2019s the net of all this is been that the large anticipated surplus in the copper markets have not materialized. Companies are reducing costs as we are and we are pleased with our progress there. There has been some curtailment not as much as might be expected, but almost 800,000 tons per year today, but the pipeline of new supply projects is declining as companies are deferring projects cutting CapEx and all of this is resulting in a longer-term outlook for very positive copper price environment and therefore we focused on finding a way to structure our business to take advantage of that. Page 5 is a slide that illustrates the thing that I've been talking about for years. Existing base production is declining over the next 10 years Wood Mackenzie predicts an 18% decline in production from just under 20 million tons a year to just over 16 million tons a year. If you take very modest outlooks for our global consumption growth they use 1.7%, you end up with a shortfall of mine supply in relation to consumption of 7 million tons. Right now Wood Mackenzie estimates that highly probable mine developments only 2 million tons that lead 5 million tons to be made up by other projects. The top 10 mines in the world produce about that level, so that shows the extent of the shortfall in one-third of that 5 million has to be come from new projects that are not considered probable there that\u2019s over 3 million tons, that\u2019s three, yes indeed there is eight \u2013 roughly eight Morenci, so its got to be a lot of new mines developed and the selling price even in today's world for developing new mines is that prices that are probably 50% higher than the current price. So that\u2019s what we are in the business for and we remain confident about it. So what are we doing right now that\u2019s was on everybody's mind and that\u2019s what we are focusing on. We are executing our strategy, we are going to strengthen our balance sheet, we are going to maintain a high quality portfolio of assets and we are going to position them for value creation. We've adjusted our mine plants curtails, some high cost production, have contingency plans for taking further steps if need to be that\u2019s going well. We are completing our major projects with the Cerro Verde project that\u2019s the completion of the third of three projects that we started in 2011and all three of those is going well and will be beneficial to us in the coming years. We financially suspended our dividend; we issued $2 million of equity in 2015. Our asset sales progress which we commented on in some detail in our fourth quarter earnings release is going very well. We are really encouraged by the nature of those discussions and now we've taken steps through restructuring our management oil and gas business, taking cost cuts to align that business with our corporate objectives of improving our balance sheet and reducing by reducing cost of approaching future investments in a different way. And so that is what we are doing and what we are all about. In terms of cost experience in the mining business for the first quarter, you can see on Slide 7 that we\u2019ve made progress, we are down \u2013 we achieved levels at lower than our January guidance at consolidated $1.38. We\u2019re reducing that further as you\u2019ll see for 2016 as a year, particularly strong performance and Red Conger is here with his team and the Americas where we\u2019ve come in below our fourth quarter numbers and our guidance for site production and delivery cost in the Americas and we continue to have our low-cost operations in Indonesia and Africa. Volumes were good, consistent with our guidance going into the quarter. So running the fundamentals of our business is important and our guys are doing great doing it. Asset transactions that we've announced to date includes the Morenci transaction and two smaller transactions, good values in those, Morenci scheduled to close in the second quarter, no hitches there. We recently announced a transaction involving the Serbia exploration project Timok, which we\u2019re getting both good initial values, accomplishing some strategic objectives in getting initial development going on the upper zone, while we were going to retain a significant interest in operational control of the potentially much, much larger lower zone. So that is going good. We are advancing discussions on additional transactions, very pleased with that project. Much more confident today than we were early during the first quarter when the market was in such a concerning situation, but what we\u2019re seeing here and we\u2019re in advanced discussions is the scarcity of quality assets in the Copper business is attracting significant interest from potential purchasers who share our longer-term positive view of the marketplace. So we are confident that we are going to be able to achieve the goals that we set out. And beyond that we have other opportunities that are available to us that we\u2019re not currently pursuing but in which parties have stepped up and said they're very interested in those. So while we don't have specific transactions to report today I am telling you that we internally are very optimistic, confident that we\u2019re going to be able to go forward and meet our goals in a way that\u2019s going to be positive for our Company and positive for our investors. The reason we can do this is because this portfolio of assets, we got pictures here on Page 9 of Morenci recently expanded largest copper mine very profitable in North America very long life. Cerro Verde as we developed it have the world's largest concentrating facility and it is ramped up very well and without the kind of typical startup issues you have in terms of cost and schedule and mechanical issues going forward, it was a big project $4.6 billion, but lots of support from the local community in the Arequipa region of Peru, great team, has gone very well. Grasberg where we continue to have discussions with the Government of Indonesia on our contract is remarkable long-term resource one of the industries historically largest copper and gold reserves and it's an asset that is very important to our portfolio, important to the Government of Indonesia, important to the province of Papua. And then Tenke Fungurume is the most successful largest mine in the copper belt region of Katanga and Zambia and operating extremely well and has a long life with very significant development opportunities associated with. And coming back to Grasberg, we of course want to refer back to the important letter that we received on October 7, when the Mines Minister, was support of the President indicated that the government would move towards granting our contract extension on terms that were consistent with our existing COW in terms of the financial aspects of it and the enforceability of it. The revised revisions to the regulations that were anticipated in unfortunately have not been adopted instead; the country is now working on revising its mining law and the related regulations. The government officials continue to express support for the position in the October 7 letter. We have agreed as part of that to divest incremental interest in PT-FI at fair market value up to 30%. Press reports out today about a government position referring to replacement cost and a lower valuation than the $17 billion valuation we submitted in January of this year. The official letter from the government did not give a valuation amount. It is in the press, but it wasn\u2019t in the letter. They refer to regulations, not specifically replacement cost. I want to tell you that in all of our agreements with Government of Indonesia, we have indicated any divestment would be a fair market value that\u2019s consistent with our contract and that remains our position. Slide 10, shows the Cerro Verde project. You can just see how well this thing is ramped up. We began first copper in September and month-by-month we've increased the throughput through our new Concentrator 2 project. In March, we hit above capacity, 373,000 tons a day. Strong performance on capital cost management startup though that was an issue for us, that was our objective a year ago to talk to you about, at this call about what we\u2019re going to do in 2015 here is an example of how we execute. Since we did the Phelps Dodge deal nine years ago now, I\u2019ve talked, I think, on every conference call about the strength of Freeport has been in our copper resources. Very large proved and probable reserves, very large mineralized material at our existing mines that provide assurance of the opportunities to invest when the market\u2019s fit. And then potential that is huge that goes beyond that, so that\u2019s what we still have and this is what\u2019s going to allow us to deal with this balance sheet issue by raising capital through property sales or otherwise and then end up with a very substantial copper resource-based company as we go forward. That\u2019s our strategy and this is a reason why we will be able to execute it effectively. Now, to show you \u2013 and I think those of you who follow us know we\u2019ve got a great copper business underneath all this market issues associated with oil and gas investment. The Company has a remarkable copper business. This is shown that by in 2015, when we\u2019re still investing in Cerro Verde so aggressively and we had EBITDA that matched our CapEx. Going into 2016, as we were wrapping up Cerro Verde and copper, even lower copper prices averaging $2.17, EBITDA substantially exceeded CapEx. And as we look forward to the year 2016, at varying copper prices from here forward, first quarters in the books, but it\u2019s $2 for the rest of the year, we would have $4.6 billion of EBITDA, $2.25, it\u2019s $5.7 billion, $2.50, it\u2019s $6.8 billion, and our CapEx is only $1.8 billion as we\u2019ve completed Cerro Verde and as we're continuing to invest in Grasberg underground and managing maintenance capital in very effective way. So we got a business that is generating substantial cash flows to help us with our financial objectives. Now in the oil and gas business, the debt level that we have of roughly $20 billion was created by the initial oil and gas investments and subsequent spending in that business on an aggressive growth profile. That was really upset by initially the fall in oil prices and then when copper prices fell that took away the ability of the copper business to support it with its own cash flows. So that\u2019s why we are having to take these really aggressive actions now to rectify our balance sheet. We got a new organizational structure in the oil and gas business. It\u2019s now being integrated into our Freeport-McMoRan corporate structure, being run as an operating division as opposed to a standalone corporate entity that it has been done since the acquisition in 2013. This is allowing us to reduce cost. Last week, we reduced employment by roughly 25% and we are continuing to look for ways to reduce costs through looking at office facilities and other cost elements. We are going to align the way we spend money in that business with our corporate objectives and in terms of how do we generate cash flows, how do we contribute to our balance sheet improvement activities. We are winding down significant capital spending. We have recently completed a series of tieback wells to our production facilities that\u2019s going to allow us for a period of time to maintain near-term production without additional drilling. In the Holstein Deep area we commenced initial production just this month. Two additional wells are coming on in the second quarter. At Horn Mountain and Marlin tiebacks, we commenced production on the D-13 King well in the first quarter. Kilo/Oscar and Quebec/Victory tiebacks are in progress and we have four additional drilled wells at are in our inventory including Horn Mountain Deep that we are going to be able to bring on production without drilling new well that\u2019s going to allow us to maintain production for the foreseeable future. And when you step back and look at these assets they are very attractive. We know it\u2019s started with the acquisition prior to the merger of three underutilized deepwater platforms in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Horn Mountain Holstein projects in Marlin. That's where our tieback activities are going. We also have interest in the non-operating, new producing projects at Lucius and Heidelberg and a long-term development project in the Vito area in Mississippi Canyon. This is the structure of business. We have significant production in California, but these are really good assets. We look for potential bars for the business during the first quarter aggressively. The Board had special financial advisors. We worked with established bankers and canvas the market and because of the conditions in the marketplace with low oil prices with credit pressures on the companies from the very largest through the business with the lack of credit, we just concluded at this point that the values that might be available in sale or monetization transactions simply didn't reflect the long-term value of these assets and that's why we taken the steps to restructure our business. We have got an operating team there that's really impressive, they are experienced, they are well recognized in the industry that got a great track record and so we are very comfortable with our ability to manage this business in an effective way and realize long-term values for our business. Now turning to Slide 15, you can see the leverage to prices that our oil and gas business has and $35 Brent, we have $600,000 million, but at $45 its $1 billion and $1.4 at $55 these are EBITDA numbers and $1.8 at $65, we\u2019ve reduced CapEx for 2017 to $500 million, we do have some idle rig costs of about that amount that we are dealing with, but it is a business that is leveraged to all prices, no guarantees, but there's certainly opportunities for oil prices to increase. We can maintain production. We continue to monitor the marketplace and look for ways of contributing to our strategic objectives of improving our balance sheet. We have updated our numbers for the outlook for 2016. This does reflect the closing of the Morenci transaction where we are selling an additional 13% interest in Morenci and so that's the basic adjustment for copper and other adjustments are more in the nature of this typical ongoing adjustments. I\u2019ll point out that the unit cost for copper has been dropped to a $1.05 consolidated, that\u2019s down from a $1.10 reflects some improvement in gold price by-product but also the efforts of all our teams that reduced cost before by-products. Strong production cost of $15 a barrel, $14 a barrel for our oil business which is down a $1 operating cash flows as we talked about earlier at 4.8 to 25 copper and each $0.10 change in copper for the remainder of the year the last nine months of 2016 is $340 million variance for us. CapEx were in line with our previous estimates. Sales \u2013 as we look forward to 2017 we will see copper at $4.6 billion, gold sales rising as we complete mining the open-pit at Grasberg. Molybdenum sales being adjusted for the market and as I pointed out earlier oil sales being maintained at the current level of close to 160 million a day. EBITDA variations are shown and cash flows variations are shown on Slide 18 starting with EBITDA, this includes first quarter actuals and sensitivities for the remaining nine months averaging 2016/2017. At [$2 it\u2019s $5.6 billion, $2.25, $6.7 billion, $2.50, $7.8 billion] for EBITDA and cash flows varying over prices going from [$2, $2.50] between roughly $3.5 billion and $5 billion. Capital expenditures are dropping Page 19 we have cut capital in half for 2016 cutting it another 50% for 2017. You can see how that splits out between our oil and gas business our major mining projects. The remaining major mining project is the Grasberg underground development and then what we\u2019ve done with maintenance capital. I keep mentioning we are committed to improving our balance sheet we are going to get this $20 billion debt level down. We are going to do that by running our business right constraining cost and capital spending and also raising capital through asset sales. The improvement in our share price and our bond trading may give us some opportunities for capital markets transactions but for the time being really focused on these asset sales discussions that we\u2019re advancing. We have a very manageable near-term debt maturity schedule, we have roughly $3 billion available under our $3.5 billion amended bank credit facility, have $300 million in cash virtually - no very low maturities at least in 2016 and manageable maturities in 2017. So from a corporate standpoint our near-term liquidity is very strong. Come back to saying we\u2019re focused on execution, had a great quarter in terms of execution for \u2013 to begin the year off with. And I am very confident we\u2019ll continue that track record as we go forward into the year. So that\u2019s quick overview and I wanted to run through it, so we can have time for your questions. And so Tony, I see you\u2019re first up. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question does come from the line of Anthony Rizzuto with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Anthony Rizzuto : Thanks very much. Hi, Richard, Kathleen, Red and Mark. It's good to see the progress thus far. Richard Adkerson : Thanks Tony. Anthony Rizzuto : I've got several questions here. The first one on Indonesia and I was interested in the comments about capital spending deferrals. I was wondering if you can comment about that a little bit further. And then also, the mill issue that you experienced during the quarter and you applied a temporary fix to it. Just wondered if you could just talk about that a little bit more and what you're doing there and that type of thing. And I've got a couple other questions about different areas. Richard Adkerson : Okay, Tony. First of all we have taken steps to reduce capital. Mark Johnson\u2019s here \u2013 to reduce capital. We revised some mine plans and we are reducing capital. What we have not done yet is defer the fundamental development of our underground resources. We completed the Deep MLZ, extension of the DOZ mine. That's really a long-term extension from our initial Block Cave development beginning in the early 1980s. This is the most recent major extension on that. That was completed last year and is ramping up. The underground development of the Grasberg Block Cave, which is really beneficial to the asset, beneficial to Government of Indonesia, and of course Freeport for us to continue with that so that when the pit is completed roughly at the end of 2017, we would have that mine ready to begin ramp up. And so we\u2019ve been very reluctant, remain very reluctant to suspend that, but that is drawn into question seriously by not having the regulations amended and getting our contract extended. We obviously are spending that money in expectation and confidence that we will get extended. And the government officials keep saying that, but have not taken the actions that are necessary to document it yet. Roughly 75% or more of the production from the underground is going to be realized after 2021 when our primary term ends, so we\u2019re currently engaged with the government and explain that to them. We also have the issue there with the smelter that we\u2019ve agreed to develop, provided we get our contract extension and we're unable to spend substantial money on advancing this smelter project without having contract extended. So that's the big issues we face, discussions are ongoing as we speak, and our Board is considering what actions we should take. With respect to the mill issue, Mark, why don\u2019t I let you explain that briefly? Mark Johnson : Okay. Yes, Tony. In late January, we had a bulk sale in our 38-foot Siemens wrap-around mill. It\u2019s a gearless motor, electric motor that both failed and it\u2019s ended up shorting out of about seven of the coils, there\u2019s about 648 coils that are part of the stater. As you mentioned, we initially were able to bypass that damaged segment and we\u2019re able to run the mill fine, about 5% derated. Since that period, we\u2019ve evaluated the longer term repair and got prepared for it and determine that we should take it down in April, which we did, just over eight days ago. We took the mill down, we\u2019ve got Siemens there to help us, some other contractors, so we\u2019re just eight days into the repair, but it\u2019s going very well. We scheduled about 32 days of downtime for this repair, but we are pretty confident where we sit right now that that will be closer to 24, 25 days. So in addition to repairing the mill, we are going to look at some of the issues and we think we can address any of the issues that might have caused that bolt to fail in the first place. And we\u2019re also obviously taking advantage of this downtime to reduce some opportunity maintenance throughout the plant. Richard Adkerson : All of these things are reflected in our outlook, in our cost, in our production volumes, and so forth. First time this is happening, 20 years of operation of this mill and it\u2019s happened in other places. And we\u2019re confident getting it fixed on schedule that Mark talked to you about. Anthony Rizzuto : Thanks, both. Richard, just a follow-up on Indonesia in terms of the bigger picture with \u2013 from a standpoint of the negotiations, the discussions with the government. Is it still the biggest log jam there, is that still the refusal to this point for the government to want to discuss this extension only until two years before the original COW is due to expire? Richard Adkerson : Well, that is the current regulation. Our legal position is that regulation doesn't apply to our contract, but so far the government has not taken steps to revise that regulation. My observation is that there is a wider recognition of that being a problem not just for Freeport, but for the mining industry in general and the anticipation by many is that that would be addressed in the revision to the mining law and the regulations. So that is a current issue for the government officials. We thought it would have been resolved by now, it has not been and so now the government is working with the DPR to address it that way. That has an uncertain timeframe for getting done and you have to admit uncertain outcomes because of the different political views, so anyway we are continuing to work with them. Anthony Rizzuto : Okay, Richard. And then I want to ask a question with regard to the asset sales process. I think you mentioned in your comments, you mentioned something about other opportunities and I didn't quite know what you meant by that? Richard Adkerson : Let me address this Tony then we are going to \u2013 need let others come on and ask question. Anthony Rizzuto : Okay, understood. Richard Adkerson : But all I'm doing is referring back to my original comments in the first quarter \u2013 the fourth quarter year-end earnings release that to convey to the market that we\u2019re putting our highest priority in fixing our balance sheet and that we would look for opportunities involving all of our \u2013 any of our assets. And so what we've done since then as we focused on transactions that would help us achieve our transactions in a positive way. We are going to work and I believe we will get those transactions completed, but beyond that we have other assets that are not part of our current transactions that we would turn to if we are not successful with this initial round of discussions. I am telling you I believe we will be successful with the initial rounds of discussions, but if for whatever reason we are not, we have other alternatives to turn to it. Anthony Rizzuto : Understand Richard. Let\u2019s appreciate that and I'll get back in queue. Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Well, thanks Tony and I just want to say you got appreciate that these are confidential discussions that take time and due diligence and a lot of issues go into it, but I'm feeling much better today than I did in January. Anthony Rizzuto : Thanks Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Evan Kurt with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Evan Kurt : Hi, good morning. Richard Adkerson : Good morning, Evan. Evan Kurt : I had a question on Cerro Verde. I guess there's been some reports out that the water allocation issues with Rio Chile, and it seems like from your guidance that you're managing to move you through this without any sort of issue. I'm just wondering if there's any risk to that? Richard Adkerson : Well, the reports came about because this El Nino effects have weather consequences throughout areas where we operate and there was a drought period there, the river was affected by because of the upstream downs. And so there was some allocation deals \u2013 rains I mean there has been returns of replenishing rains and we\u2019ve worked this out, we don't anticipate that being a problem at all. Evan Kurt : Got it. Thanks. And then one question on Heidelberg. Cobalt had put something in their 10-K that I picked up on, something about the appraisal well leading to them, I can't remember the exact language, but concerns that there could be a material downgrade to plan. Is there anything that you can comment on there as far as what you're seeing out of that? Richard Adkerson : Sure, first of all when you look at these earnings releases of different companies, they acquired their interest in different ways I mean and so their book carrying values are going to differ company to company. The geology at Heidelberg is [indiscernible] analysis is changed some of the locations of the wells are being revised. Our team still has confidence about the resource and this will be handled and so what\u2019s you're seeing now is the effects of some of the initial development wells having to be relocated in terms of where they're being drilled to access the reservoir. Visit with the team last week and they feel confident that it's not a - is not really a detriment to the overall resource that\u2019s available there. Evan Kurt : Okay thanks. Just maybe one final one, if I may. At the last half of the year, at the market equity raise, the stock price was actually lower than where it was trading today. I'm just wondering given the rebound in the equity if that's something that you may consider following up on. Richard Adkerson : Yes, I made a brief reference to that, to the fact that share price is up and the trading in our bonds is really improved over the last six weeks. And so that opens up consideration for other types of capital raises for us. We currently believe that it's beneficial to us - for us to first look to asset sale transactions because we believe that we're going to be able to accomplish those in a positive way and hopefully you know and the market is going to be driven by a lot of factors, that they\u2019ll be well received by the market and that might give us opportunities in the future to do better. So that\u2019s kind of the strategy of what we are looking at. Evan Kurt : Got it. Thank you. Richard Adkerson : And Kathleen\u2019s giving me a note just to remind everybody that the basic source for our mill water at Cerro Verde is not from the river or the dams for the expansion at least, but from this wastewater system that we put in for the city of Arequipa. And the issue that Evan raised was the downstream water was affected by this lower flow through the river and that was what led to it. But our water is coming from the wastewater system for the expansion. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. David Gagliano : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to drill down a bit more on the divestment plans on the mining side. First of all, in Indonesia, what are Freeport's alternatives, if for whatever reason the Indonesian government doesn't agree to Freeport's expectations regarding the fair value of that ownership interest? That's my first question. Richard Adkerson : Let me answer that, Dave. The ultimate resolution mechanism that we have is international arbitration. That\u2019s a provision that\u2019s in our contract and based on all the legal advice that we've gotten over the years and recently, our position in an arbitration proceeding would be very strong. And because the legal - the contract is available on file with the SEC you can read it straightforward been in place since 1991 and so we believe its ironclad. We are trying to avoid that, it\u2019s such a long-term asset, we are trying to avoid going into a legal proceeding like that but that\u2019s our ultimate fall back. Under our contract we have no obligation to divest that was acknowledged by the government in Indonesian in the mid 1990s and a letter that we have on file and all of our discussions since then where we voluntarily offered to divest to try to be responsive to the new mining law and to the aspirations of the government has always been at fair market value. David Gagliano : Okay. Okay. Is there - just as a follow-up to that, is there any specific deadline or time line that we should be thinking about here for this or it's an open-ended negotiation? Richard Adkerson : It is not a specific timeline, but we are spending so much money, together with Rio Tinto we\u2019re spending about a $1 billion a year on this underground development, and we simply just can't keep doing that without bringing this issue to a head. And the government wants us to proceed with this smelter and best case for constructing a smelter based on global experience all the smelters that have been built in China is that starting all out today would require us to go to 2019 to build a new smelter and without having contract assurance beyond 2021, we simply can't do that as a practical business matter and that\u2019s the message we\u2019ve been conveying to the government. David Gagliano : Okay. That makes sense. And then just my separate question related to the divestment plans, just regarding the comments about discussions on additional transactions, which of the mining assets specifically are actually currently being negotiated for sale or JV, et cetera, aside from Grasberg. Obviously not looking for anything other than just the assets that are currently under negotiation. Richard Adkerson : Dave, because these discussions involve multiple parties and we have multiple alternatives to consider I just don't think it's an answer I should publicly state right now. And I know all of you want to have more details, we want to get this thing done, we have a real sense of urgency for it. I\u2019d just comment to you the processes is one that involves a great deal going into it in terms of negotiating the details of the transaction and people conducting due diligence. These mining assets are complicated, complicated assets. We\u2019ve got great assets and lots of support to values. So all I can tell you is I feel real good about where we are. Now, I wish I could share more details, but I simply can\u2019t. David Gagliano : Okay. I appreciate the position you're in. All right, thanks very much. Richard Adkerson : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn with Barclays. Please go ahead. Matthew Korn : Hey, good morning everyone. Thank you for taking my question as well. Question on the copper market. We had CESCO a couple weeks back. Most folks seem to come out of there with a sense that the copper industry really sees cost cutting, not curtailment of supplies, is the best path to take in the current market. I was wondering, Richard, if you believe we're going to need any more cuts in production over this next year to help support pricing given some projects ramping over the rest of the year, given Grasberg ramping up. For you, would you consider maybe fully idling any of the assets where you're currently at half rates or so? Richard Adkerson : Well, thanks Matthew. I mean the reality of this, and I\u2019ve been through a number of these cycles and gone through this is that decisions to shutdown mines are very complicated because of the transition cost that you incur in having to do it. Not only is there an issue of the \u2013 and this varies country-by-country depending on labor laws, but the cost of employee severances, but it also often triggers reclamation obligations and shutdown obligations because the mine is an operating system. And when you operate that system, you're able to manage a lot of environmental issues in a particular way by the way you process material. And once you shut it down then you often have to come up with new system of how to operate water flows and so forth. That\u2019s one of the things we faced at Sierrita. Those are complicated. So the barriers to shutdown mines that you are seeing across the industry has to do with these transition costs. And sometimes those costs are economically more significant than operating losses at marginal profitability or even losses. Not clearly the lower prices go, the more pressure will be and the more shut-ins you\u2019ll have. We would have some more. But for example at our \u2013 and sometimes it\u2019s not the entire mine. Its segments of the mine, which we did in Morenci in 2008, 2009 when we cutback our mill processing and cutback our mine rates and the crushing rock we put on our SXEW stacks, our lead stacks. For example, we cutback El Abra by half, but the remaining half that we\u2019re operating at El Abra is profitable at these prices and at lower prices. So it's a dynamic situation, it will be driven by prices, but what we\u2019re seeing is people are really focused on cost. Now, the thing that I think that we're looking at in a positive way and I\u2019ll suggest that that market looks at, is what is the price of replacing this shortfall that\u2019s looming for the copper industry. I gave you the numbers 10 years out, but that the market does not have a significant surplus balance today. Who knows what\u2019s going to happen. There is risk in the global marketplace, but there is opportunities. And this thing could come back and even today the incentive price to develop new production and we know this because we got all these resource being studying for years, it's going to take a very high price $3, $3.30 to develop new resources from known resources. There are not major new discoveries. The expansion projects that are available to the industry are either expensive underground projects or projects that require low grades and lots of infrastructure development, so absence just a calamity in China or the global marketplace are still in very positive that this copper business is going to be a great business to be in and Freeport is going to be a really strong leader, player in that industry. Matthew Korn : Thanks. That actually well leads to my next question. Given your position as a leader in the industry, how \u2013 when you're looking and considering the sale of the mining assets, how important is it for you that you still maintain operating control over that asset? I'm wondering whether that has limited the opportunity set, the set of potential buyers who may not be interested if there's -- if you're really just talking about minority stakes. Richard Adkerson : Well listen, if you just listen to what I just said you know how bad I feel about selling any of our assets. I mean we put together a great company ahead of diverse set of assets and now circumstance had led us to have to do some and we really don't want to do. So that answer your question varies asset by asset. When we look at our business there certain of our assets and we create a lot of value for by having them managed together, regular share equipment, technology, people, resources, and that\u2019s a huge benefit for us. And so one thing we are looking at how can we do transactions that retain that ability for Freeport to create value. Other assets which we don't want to sell, but we have to look to sell would involve a transfer of ownerships. There are certain companies in the world today, who would only do a transaction if they can be operators. You read about it everyday in the paper. So we are having to look across the Board for that and at the end of the day, we are looking for transactions that are executable at acceptable values and in ways it help us meet our financial objectives. Matthew Korn : Got it. Thanks so much and best of luck. Richard Adkerson : Thank you so much Matthew. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sussman with Clarkson. Please go ahead. Jeremy Sussman : Hi. Thanks very much for taking the question and certainly good job on costs this quarter. In terms of just \u2013 in terms of the asset sales process, I guess you've announced $1.4 billion since mid-February. Obviously in your release you noted that you expect to show additional progress. I think specifically in Q2 was what was mentioned. I know there's a springing collateral and guaranteed trigger that was added, which basically means I think you need to total $3 billion in aggregate announcements by mid year. Assuming my math is correct, that's another $1.6 billion or so in announcements in the next couple months. So I guess do you feel comfortable with the timeline and maybe just conceptually how would you sort of describe activity level relative to your initial expectations in terms of just parties at the table. Any big picture color would be great? Thanks guys. Bye-bye. Richard Adkerson : All right. The answer is yes, we really expect to meet that springing collateral test in the second quarter, very confident about that. And I've tried to get across and have done my best to talk with you today knowing that I can't meet the hopes that many had that I could give you very specifics, but to tell you how much more positive I am on this call than I was on our call for the year-end earnings release. This year started out really tough and I\u2019m not telling any of you that it really started out itself with uncertainties in the global commodity space and uncertainties about China and copper, a lot of unknowns as to how we receive. We thought internally as we talked among ourselves about how we approach the market that we would get good receptively because of the high quality of assets. Now we know we are getting good receptivity, so we know it internally, we are confident we are going to get this done in a reasonable way and now you know we're going to be charged with executing that reporting to you the results as we go forward. Jeremy Sussman : Richard, that extra color is very helpful. I'll turn it over. Thanks very much. Richard Adkerson : Okay. Thank you, Jeremy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead. Chris Mancini : Hi there. Just a quick question. Most of my questions were answered. In terms of cash management when you do realize the proceeds from the sales of Morenci and your JV with Reservoir, do you intend to buy back some of your higher yielding bonds at that point or are there covenants in your credit line that would require you to hold a cash balance to pay that down first? Kathleen Quirk : Chris, this is Kathleen. We have agreed to a cash flow asset sale cash sweep to our term loan lenders, a 50% of asset sales and if our leverage is greater than six times, which we\u2019re not currently, they would get 100% of proceeds. So we'll have opportunities we believe to not only repay term loans, but also look to repay other debt in the capital structure and look at you know take care of the upcoming maturity. So that is what we're thinking at this time. And as Richard said the debt levels, the trading levels have improved from where they were earlier in the year, which opens up other opportunities. But we\u2019re focused on absolute leverage reduction, but also given ourselves enough runway over the next several years in terms of maturity schedule. Chris Mancini : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot and good luck with the asset sales. Richard Adkerson : Chris, I can\u2019t tell the frustration of looking six weeks ago where our bonds were trading, where our stock was trading and not having the money to buy them. Chris Mancini : Yes, no, I bet. For sure. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead. John Tumazos : Thank you. I was studying slide 23, which has the oil and gas output price realization and direct cost and it looked like the margin was $7.96 per BOE times the $12.1 million, or $96 million for the quarter, if I'm reading it right. Put a different way, a $0.09 upswing in the copper price would give you as much cash flow as oil and gas has in the March quarter, admittedly probably at the bottom of the oil price, we all hope. Do you think it's worth just shutting in all the oil and gas output and preserving the resource and waiting for a better day after the market gives us $0.25 of upside on copper? Richard Adkerson : Well you know John that\u2019s a kind of scenario analysis that in hindsight you could say maybe that would been the right answer, we can\u2019t live in that world. And the nature of oil production is such that you just cannot make decisions like that and preserve the reservoir, preserve the asset. So it\u2019s you know I recall back in 2008 you may have been at a meeting I had one time when somebody said, why don\u2019t you just shut in all of your North American production. The market doesn\u2019t need it and it would balance the market and is not - my answer then was you know running these kinds of assets is not like managing a portfolio of stocks and bonds. You can\u2019t just sell something and get out of it you have to manage a lot of complicated operating factors in doing it. I understand your financial analysis the practicalities of it or that we can generate some cash to help meet our obligations that we have. We\u2019re cutting these costs aggressively now. We\u2019ll continue to do that and we\u2019ll take the actions to preserve these assets and create some incremental value over time. We are working on contingency plans now, for example, of how do we look forward in terms of drilling some of the really attractive tieback opportunities. We are not going to spend money now, but we\u2019re going to be prepared to as markets increase to help arrest the natural decline. There is a big difference in these average numbers that you talk about between California, which is a significant production, and the deepwater. The California doesn\u2019t have the decline issues that the deepwater has and we\u2019re able to basically breakeven out there and preserve all of the resource, but continue and operate it. If you were to try to shut in that California production with the nature of the way that it\u2019s produced \u2013 you are doing that. So the oil and gas business is in tough shape. It\u2019s just in tough shape, because our plan was to have it, fund its own CapEx and there were all \u2013 besides the acquisition, I mentioned there were all these commitments made to fund an aggressive growth project that was in. The legs were cut out of that by the drop in oil prices. And now that business has committed cost and obligations that's well over its current resources, we know that because we just try to sell those resources. So we got a profitable copper business. We got to manage this oil and gas business in a different way to reduce costs, focus on how to preserve the asset, because the offshore depletion will happen at some point in future, not in the next period of time, because the success we\u2019ve had in drilling. But it\u2019s a challenge I mean I\u2019m not going to pull any punches on it. But we\u2019ve got a good team. I\u2019m really enjoying getting to work with these guys directly. They are doing a great job. They\u2019re well respect in the industry. I know that, because I\u2019ve talked to a lot of people outside our Company about how they run the business. And we\u2019re going to find a way to get value out of these assets. John Tumazos : Thank you. If I can ask a simpler question, just about the accounting. Over the last six quarters the oil and gas charges have been about $22.9 billion. Is there only about $5 billion in carrying value left? And what was the 12-month average oil price for the March quarter, full cost test? Would think that at some point the balances would wind down and the charges would pretty much be de minimis. Kathleen Quirk : John, it\u2019s Kathleen. If you look at the balance sheet, we separately identify the capitalized cost for oil and gas. And we've got \u2013 at March 31, we have roughly $3.4 billion which includes $1.7 billion that\u2019s subject to amortization which is part of this full cost ceiling test that you referenced and we\u2019ve got about just over 1.7 not subject to amortization and those are things where we don't have proved reserves both at this point. And in terms of the 12-month trailing average that we used at March 31 for the ceiling test write-down it was $46 a barrel WTI. John Tumazos : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Christopher Terry : Hi, guys. I'll try to be quick. You've obviously talked about asset sales and mentioned around your views on equity raisings. What's your thoughts around streaming or royalty transactions? Richard Adkerson : We\u2019ve had a lot of discussions about that recently and over the years. I mean going back 25 years or more, we\u2019ve looked at doing that. The asset where we have the biggest streaming opportunities is Grasberg with the big gold component associated with it. Yes, that gold component is what makes Grasberg such a strong strategic asset for us and reduces our cost and that\u2019s - it is not an inexpensive place to operate. We got 30,000 plus workers there and one of the world's largest mills, what will be the world's largest underground development, complicated environmental issues to maintain complicated community issues and community support issues, logistics issues. And so really we\u2019ve concluded and thank God we didn't succumb to that idea in past years because today that would be a bad decision, but we really believe having the goal component of Grasberg together with high copper grades what makes it such a great strategic asset for us. So we look at that, we watched what\u2019s going on in the industry, we talked to companies involved in bankers and if something makes sense we would be open to it, but today we\u2019ve concluded that it has not made sense. Christopher Terry : Okay. Thanks very much. And just a final one. Given the importance of the second half of Grasberg and the mill issues you've highlighted, can you just remind us, what's the mill split between the open pit and the underground for 2016 and 2017? Mark Johnson : This is Mark. Right now, the underground provides about 45,000 tons of ore out of 200,000, so the remainder is coming from the pit and that will change next year 2017 the pit starts to wind down a bit and the underground ramps up. It's more like 130 and 70. 130 from the pit and 70 from the underground. Christopher Terry : Okay, thanks very much. Richard Adkerson : And we vary that from time-to-time based on the nature of the material in the pit. Mark Johnson : We are looking at the highest value material we sent to the mill, so that drives that determination. Richard Adkerson : I visit there and went to the team and I mean its and I\u2019ve been around since the initial development of the Grasberg and to see the technology advances, so what we are able to do underground is remarkable through remote mining equipment, safety factor of that, but also the efficiency we have, we are working very well with our contractors and our team there is doing that. So this you know \u2013 once at this point in time, we're looking at having a significant reduction in mill throughput as results are going on ground. Now we look at it and we are going to be able to keep our mill build. We have to make some \u2013 actually some enhancements over time in the mill. The resources is just grown and the economics of mining, large-scale underground mining have become much more attractive than we would've thought years past. Christopher Terry : Thanks very much for the color. Richard Adkerson : Yes, thanks Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fields with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Matthew Fields : Hi, everyone. I just wanted to ask, there's been \u2013 I know you're laser focused on asset sales and it seems like you're pretty confident about hitting that June 30 deadline to avoid the springing collateral, but \u2013 and I probably shouldn't ask this as a credit analyst, but what's so bad about secured debt? I mean, if I'm an equity holder I think I'd rather grant the bank security over some assets rather than giving away a chunk of future earnings. Kathleen Quirk : Well, I think as an investment grade company, we worked hard to have a structure of flexible capital structure where everyone was secured. Our objective is Richard just talked about is to takedown leverage very significantly. We think over time, we have the ability to commence the rating agencies of the strength of our assets. And we like to return to investment grade and we also see the benefits of having non-secured capital structure. And having said all that, we recognized the relationships we\u2019ve had with our bank group, the commitments they've had to support our business and we are going to work cooperatively to make sure that those lenders - all the lenders are protected but also just to make sure we have an ongoing continuation of bank relationships that will allow us flexibility in the near-term to navigate through this situation. But we do - we worked hard to get to a completely unsecured structure and we want to get our balance sheet back and restore the strength that we had previously and I know it\u2019s a tall order but we are very focused on taking the steps to get there. Matthew Fields : Okay. And then I think just one more follow-up. I think earlier on the call you said that the proceeds from Morenci, you obviously have that 50% cash flow sweep but that you could look elsewhere in the capital structure. I think in the press release when you announced it you said that FCX expects to use the proceeds to repay borrowings under its bank term loan and revolving credit facility. Is that still the thinking for that $1 billion of proceeds? Kathleen Quirk : Yes, we have \u2013 as you saw we had $500 million drawn roughly at March 31 under our bank credit facility and we've got the mandatory prepayment on the term loan and will use the balance to reduce borrowings under the revolver. Matthew Fields : Okay. And then just sort of lastly, just real high level on this whole asset sale versus secured debt question, because I get it a lot and it's something we talk about a lot in the credit world, is obviously there's a disconnect between the way your securities are trading when we see the spot copper prices and where strategic assets trade on a sort of future basis with obviously a much higher longer term price deck. Is the tradeoff do I sell assets at this valuation versus a secured debt deal that could clear my runway for a number of years? What's the tradeoff there? Kathleen Quirk : Just to be clear we\u2019re not doing these asset sales to avoid secured debt that was just a provision that we agree to in our bank facility. We\u2019re doing the asset sales to repay debt and restore our balance sheet strength. So it has nothing to do with secured versus unsecured it\u2019s simply is the reality of us needing to accelerate our debt reduction and that's what we\u2019re focused on and we are looking for ways to do it in a way that reflects long-term values in these assets not the kind of spot pricing that\u2019s currently reflected in the market but long-term values for these assets as you saw with the Morenci transaction while we were able to demonstrate a very significant value and its reflective of that long-term asset of the resource there and that the price view of other participants in the industry not to use a spot pricing but a longer-term view of prices. Matthew Fields : Okay Thanks for the [indiscernible]. Just one last, real quick. Is the priority overall debt reduction over sort of just clearing the deck for the next four, five years of maturities? Richard Adkerson : Yes, Matthew let me just make a broader comment. Our company is over leveraged, I mean in the nature of the business that we are in where you have such high operating leverage from commodity prices, you just should not be this leveraged, because when conditions unfold as they do from time-to-time and your revenues drop because of what's going on the global commodity prices having this kind of debt is a killer and unfortunately we\u2019re in a position that were in. So from a broader perspective we got great assets, we need to get back to where we have a balance sheet that is does not put us in a overleveraged situation. And that's what we\u2019re about fixing that. So unfortunately we got here and now we\u2019ve got to fix it. So all the other issues about managing maturity levels in doing that is part of the tactics of how do you do that. But at the end of the day we have good assets, we have great resources, we can create a good company, we have to give up some of those to get us to a position of we\u2019re not overleveraged. Matthew Fields : All right. Thanks very much for the perspective. Operator : Your final question will come from the line Justine Fisher with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Justine Fisher : Thanks. I'll make it quick since it's been a long time. Just on - Kathleen, on the working capital comments in press release, you said that based on certain price assumptions the Company expects $4.8 billion of operating cash flow this year, including $800 million from working capital and other tax payments. My question is how sensitive is that $800 million to pricing, i.e., if we have a different price deck than you guys, could we assume that most of that $800 million might still materialize? Because that number was a much larger gain that what we had expected. I just want to know how much certainty we could have around that number if our price deck is different. Kathleen Quirk : Yes, it wasn\u2019t materially different, Justine, at $2 copper, we\u2019re getting and we\u2019ve received some already, but we\u2019re getting some refunds, tax refunds in 2016 related to payments made in previous years. And then also with our international business the timing of when we pay taxes based on the prior year has an impact on it. But we did going into the year expect a working capital source and it\u2019s somewhat price-sensitive but not significantly price-sensitive. Justine Fisher : All right. Fabulous. Thanks very much. End of Q& A Operator : We will now turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. Richard Adkerson : Once again thanks everybody for your interest in our Company and participating in the call. And we look forward to our next opportunity we have to get together. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Thank you. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2015 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer of FCX; and Red Conger, President of Americas and Africa. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results, and then turn the call over to Richard, who will review our recent performance and outlook. As usual, we'll open our \u2013 after our remarks, we'll open the call up for questions. Today, FCX reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $479 million, or $0.38 per share for the second quarter of 2016. As detailed in the release the net loss attributable to common stock included a special item totaling $452 million, or $0.36 per share during the second quarter, primarily for the previously reported drillship settlements and impairment of our oil and gas properties partly offset by net gains on the sale of assets. After adjusting for these net charges, our second quarter adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $27 million, or $0.02 a share. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for second quarter of 2016, approximated $966 million, we have a slide on the deck that shows you the go forward of getting to that number. And during the second quarter, we completed previously announced asset sales for aggregate consideration of $1.3 billion, that included the $1 billion sale of the additional 13% undivided interest in Morenci during May. And also in May, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our interest in TF Holdings Limited for $2.65 billion in cash and contingent consideration of up to $120 million. In accordance with the accounting guidelines as you'll see in the release, the results of Tenke are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. During the quarter, our consolidated sales volume totaled 1.1 billion pounds of copper, 156,000 ounces of gold, 19 million pounds of molybdenum and 12.4 million barrels of oil equivalents. Our average price of copper was $2.18 per pound. That was below last year's second quarter average of $2.71 per pound. Gold averaged $1,292 during the quarter. That was above last year's quarterly average of $1,174. and our realized price for crude oil of $41 per barrel was below last year's quarterly average price of just under $68 per barrel, which included $12 per barrel in realized gains on derivative contracts. Unit net cash cost for the quarter averaged $1.33 per pound, that was lower as expected than the year ago period of $1.50 per pound, and that primarily reflects the higher copper volumes and economies of scale that have come in during the quarter as anticipated, and the impact of ongoing cost reduction initiatives partly offset by lower gold and silver credits. We generated operating cash flows during the quarter of $874 million, which exceeded our capital expenditures of $833 million during the quarter. As previously reported, we have exchanged some of our senior notes into equity through July 25. Yesterday, we exchanged a total of $369 million in face amount of bonds at a cost of $311 million or approximately 28 million shares of our common stock in a series of privately negotiated transactions. Our debt at the end of June was $19.3 billion and consolidated cash was approximately $350 million. We ended the quarter with no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. And we ended this quarter and currently have approximately 1.33 billion common shares outstanding, which includes the shares that we issued through yesterday, in connection with the settlement of the debt exchange. I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who'll be referring to our slide materials and discussing our operations and outlook. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Kathleen, and thank all of you for joining us, today. I'd like to step back a moment and look at our overall situation a bit, before we turn to the quarter, and we have some important facts to talk about, situations to talk about with the quarter, and we'll cover those in detail. But I believe it's important for you to understand that we feel very good about the progress we've made during the first half of the year. Late last night, as we put the finishing touches on today's presentation, Kathleen and I were reflecting aback about, where our company stood a year ago. A year ago oil prices were in the mid-$60 a barrel, copper prices were $2.70, we were talking about controlling costs and talking about strategic alternatives for our oil and gas business. As 2015 proceeded and going into 2016, oil prices dropped at one point below $30 a barrel, copper prices dropped below $2 a pound, there was a lot of uncertainties about our company, because of the debt level, witness the way our bonds traded and our CDSs traded. We took steps, we reorganized our board, the restructured board emphasized our focus on the future of our company being in the mining business, we restructured our management team, and we took actions. When we had our year-end earnings call, there was a lot of skepticism about our ability to execute the plans that we needed to execute to address our balance sheet issues, a lot of skepticism. Internally, there was a lack of clarity about not where we were going, we knew what we had to do, but how we would get there, how the market would react to it. So, looking back, we said then that we would sell assets, raise capital, targeting $5 billion to $10 billion and we went to work. As we were doing that, Red and his team and our global operating teams focused on executing our business plans. And when you look at the charts on the side of page three \u2013 slide three, you can see how effective we've been doing that. We've reduced our site production and delivery cost before byproduct credits by 23%. Oil and gas business, we cut our production cost from $19 a barrel to $15 a barrel. We cut CapEx, we completed our major expansion project at Cerro Verde, which a year ago was a significant undertaking risk for our company and it is a very complex project \u2013 you know as it was completed, it was the largest processing facility in the history of the mining industry and it was a big project, $4.5 billion-plus. We reduced CapEx in the oil and gas business. We undertook the sale assets in a market that had uncertainties. We did this to strengthen our balance sheet, but as a surprise to some people we were able to achieve valuations that reflected a positive view of the long-term copper market. We had that a year ago, we continue to have that today and I'll talk about it. Not only does this generate cash to reduce our debt, but it highlights the value of Freeport's assets as we go forward. We have raised today over $4 billion or in position to complete transactions to raise it by only selling 9% of our copper reserves. We had an effort to sell our oil and gas business or assets, it was a tough time to do that, we restructured the business to operate within its cash flows, we reorganized the business, we dealt with some major obligations that had been committed to in past times when the strategy was to grow that business aggressively and we made some tough decisions to restructure drilling contracts and other contracts and we continue to view strategically, how these assets fit into our long-term business and we understand their values and we will look over time to see how to generate value for our shareholders out of those assets. Our copper volumes are growing with the successful Cerro Verde start up, 15% quarter-to-quarter year-on-year increase. And we'll step back and look at how our company is now positioned for free cash flow generation. As we were talking last night, Kathleen and I and our management team feel that we have truly turned the corner for Freeport. And our ability to do that wasn't just clear cut as we started the year. We proved that our assets are attractive. And our strategy and we'll talk about how our financial strategy fits with our longer term business strategy is focused on leaving us with a core set of assets to build long-term value for shareholders. It would be one thing just to sell assets simply to raise cash, but we've kept a view about what will Freeport be for the long-term and which of our assets will be there to allow us to take advantage of our core competencies as a company and also to take advantage of what we believe will be our long-term copper market. So, that was always in our mind as to what did we want to be left with after we sold assets. So, looking on page four, we have set a target of reducing our debt to $10 billion. Our debt at June 30 is just below $19 billion and we have a contract to sell our Tenke asset with the related assets that we'd be selling for $2.8 billion. Now, if we look forward at different scenarios of copper prices and with successful execution of our plants, you can see what our debt levels would be at $2 copper, $2.25 copper and $2.50 copper at the end of 2017. That reflects the transactions that we sold or we have contracts for. It does not include any divestment of PTFI shares and we have a strategy of working with the Government of Indonesia to sell an incremental approximately 20% of PTFI contingent on getting our contract extension. We will consider further asset steps, strategic steps, for example, this doesn't include any sales of our oil and gas business. And I want to emphasize that as we look at any divestment of PTFI, it's a condition that we sell those assets at fair value to our company. And so, as we looked at this and we take into account the risk possibility of copper prices trading down, throughout the Financial Community Day and with many of the experts that follow the industry, there's a risk that because of slower growth in China and global economic uncertainties that we may have to deal with lower than today's copper prices in the short-term. I'm going to talk about the longer term view, but we have to live through the short term to experience the benefits of a positive long-term market. So we sit here with a balancing act. The balancing act was to look at these debt levels, understand what it's going to take operationally to get to those, then think about what next steps should we take to address the uncertainties of the short-term market. And we are still open and on the table for all strategic moves, whether that means selling assets, selling the company, we're focused really on creating value for our shareholders, and to create that long-term value. Our recent history with this company shows that we need to have a strong balance sheet to allow us to be positioned to aggressively take care of the long-term values. We've had ongoing discussions about some other asset sales, we are continuing those. We look at capital market transactions, and today, we've announced that we have plans to file the necessary documents to allow us to issue another $1.5 billion of stock through and at the market offering. Our company has had success with these in the past. We did one in 2008-2009 crisis. We've done two of these offerings last year when our financial situation was more dark. What this allows us to do is to access the market, and if the market is available to us on a day-by-day basis to sell shares into the marketplace when there is demand for them. And so, we felt looking at these numbers that this was the step that if we can successfully execute it, you know absent just a collapse in the market, we basically have a path forward of achieving what we set out to achieve. There is no requirement to sell further assets. There is no requirement to sell further equity. We've got it now, which we didn't have six months ago, a clear-cut path as to how to get our financial situation to the point where we wanted to get it to. And we will have done it in a way that we can hold on to what we believe is our highest quality assets to build the company for the future. Now, those assets \u2013 the transactions today they're listed on page five, it includes the successful sale of an incremental interest, an incremental 13% interest to our long time highly valued partners Sumitomo and Morenci. That transaction is closed. We have a series of other smaller transactions, and the Tenke Fungurume transaction, which is where we have a contract and working with the large aluminum, they are proceeding with the necessary regulatory steps in China to get the transaction closed. Their reports are that that's going very well. They have to have a shareholder vote since there is a minority public ownership \u2013 minority public ownership, so the shareholder vote doesn't involve uncertainties as to the outcome, but procedurally it has to be conducted. All indications are that this transaction is going to be closed as anticipated in the fall. And so, that would generate for us considering all factors, something between $4 billion and $4.5 billion, pleased with that. Now what then does Freeport have left. I mean, it's a great set of assets. We will have seven copper mines, lead by our flagship mine in Morenci into North America. We also have two molybdenum mines and we have a great molybdenum business, largest producer, lowest cost producer. We have two pure molybdenum mines in North America and byproduct produced at our other mines. We also have two great mines in South America; Cerro Verde, which I'll talk about and El Abra, where we and our partner CODELCO are doing studies now for the potential for a major expansion of that property only when market conditions allow. Now, one of the things as we really gotten into this and evaluated potential transactions and buyers is really a recognition of how much value we create by having this set of assets run together. These are mines which benefit significantly from the synergies of being able to share people, technology, equipment to have the flexibility of focusing on growth projects of one of these mines or the other and looking at how to fit those together in a long-term plan, but ultimately growing volumes. You can see in these bubbles, really huge resources, over 30 billion pounds of copper reserves each in North America and South America, significant molybdenum, beyond proved reserves, huge amounts of mineralized material and future growth projects. We have a growth pipeline for this industry with these assets that extends as far as you can see. And we also have the ability of executing these when it makes sense. In undertaking low risk, executable transactions without having to do it, we can run a really rational business strategy of generating profits and focusing on long-term growth in a very business-like and rational way. And when we look at how those values fit together, we felt really it makes a lot of sense to keep the assets together for our future. And Red and his team just do an outstanding job in running this business. The Grasberg mine in Indonesia is a real special asset. I mean, it is special in many ways because of its physical location, but extraordinary because of the high grades of both copper and gold in the same ore. It's a tough mine to run, but we've done it for a long time now. We began the development, we've been there since the early 1970s in Indonesia and Papua and we've developed the Grasberg during the 1990s and now operate it, so we can see the end of the life of the open pit, the transition to an underground. We got issues to deal with. We've always had issues to deal with there, operationally, managing the environment, working with the local community, working with the changes in the Indonesian government, but underlying that is an extraordinary asset and we want to work cooperatively with the people of Indonesia and its government in a way to generate benefits that are mutual for both of us and that's what we're doing. Now, where are we today with copper markets? The surpluses today are relatively small in the marketplace and lower than people expected not too long ago as to where they were, the new supply that people like us had initiated with projects following the financial crisis of 2008, 2009, some have been delayed, some have been deferred. But the new supply is basically coming on as expected. A recent feature is that there are significantly lower disruptions than had been experienced in the industry, disruptions from labor issue, disruptions from mine and operational issues, from equipment issues. So we've had a case of where the mine \u2013 the industry has been producing basically what was available to it. And even with that, even with the new supply, the lower disruptions, the lower growth in China, the lower growth globally because of all the economic issues affecting the world, the projected medium-term deficits \u2013 in the projected medium-term, it looks like we're going to be having deficits even with very modest demand growth. So, rather than the market being overwhelmed with supply, there is ample copper around the world today. So, the market is fully supplied. But it's not being overwhelmed with new supplies and continued production even with very modest demand growth. And as you go forward, existing mines will produce less. People aren't investing in new projects. There is barriers to project development that relate to environmental, community, country issues. And as we've shown in this process that we've had about selling property, there is a significantly higher than current price required to develop new production. You just simply can't do it, and we know because we've got huge resources to develop, and we are working on plans to development. It will require higher copper price and absent a complete deterioration or significant deterioration, collapse in China market or global market, we're heading for a time when copper prices are going to be higher. That is illustrated on page eight. Now I want to say what this is and what it isn't. This shows projected existing supply before any disruption allowance from existing mines. It doesn't take into account new projects, even those projects that today look probable. But it just shows that over the next 10 years, existing mines' production is expected to decline on the order of 20%, that's roughly 4 million tons. Today the top 10 mines in the world produce about 5.5 million tons per year. And according to Wood Mackenzie, the incentive price for new development is $3.30 a pound. We know how long it takes to develop new mines. With all these resources, 100 billion pounds of reserves, 100 billion pounds of mineralized material, more resources beyond that, if we were to start today to say, let's develop an [AFE] to develop a new mine, it's on the order of 10 years before we have new production and that can't be changed, that's not economic, but that's reality of getting permits, getting mine plans, getting things organized, that's just the way it's required. Now we did this with Cerro Verde. Cerro Verde is a tremendous asset. It was started many years ago, it was discovered in the 20th Century \u2013 in the 19th Century and it was started as a very small SX/EW operation. As we acquired Phelps Dodge, they were completing a major drilling expansion in 2006, a little bit rough start off as Red and I know then, and now we've done this $4.5 billion project on budget, we've taken our mill rate from a year ago from 116,000 tons a day to 352,000 tons a day, think of that. 352,000 tons through the mill. We're mining over 600,000 tons a day. Our sales have gone from 100 million pounds to 270 million pounds. Our unit costs have gone from $1.87 to $1.22. It will be a very long-term contributor to the future of our company. This is an asset that we could sell at a very attractive value. We could conduct just a formal auction of this, it would raise a lot of money. But we believe that this is kind of core asset that we need to keep and our financial plan now will allow us to keep it. We weren't sure we could do that going into this year to build our company around for the future. We went back and looked at three of our key mines, Morenci, Cerro Verde and Grasberg and before we really started on this process, we wanted to show just how the districts that we operate in have changed over the years and what we have to continue to build on. In 1988, Morenci, as you went into the 1980s and 1990s and early 2000s, there were reports talking about the death of the Southwest copper district in the U.S. and Mexico. Morenci had relatively small reserves. We've had significant production since then. We have significant remaining reserves and potential beyond those reserves. There will be a time not in the very near-term, but we'll be announcing a major further mill expansion at Morenci to develop the sulfide reserves. Cerro Verde now is essentially full developed, but as we look below the existing outline for the fifth that will support the expansion, there is further resources there and at Grasberg, Grasberg was discovered in 1988, developed during the 1990s to become one of the mining industry's great assets and we've got 25 years left on our contract and a great future there. Then when we look broadly and as I said, we look at this set of assets in North America and South America as a set of assets managed together to take advantage. We have very large copper sulfate opportunities that have been much better defined since our Phelps Dodge acquisition through our core drilling and exploration analysis, and it's a consistent story. In mines like Baghdad, which is our mine and for the long life, operational challenges because of principally water availability and some land for tailings and so forth, but has a very significant resource. Recently, at a 100-year-old mine in New Mexico, Chino, which has been viewed as being at the very end of its life, we've been able to recently produce some incremental volumes, through our understanding of the ore body better, and then identifying the potential for large scale sulfide future development at Chino. El Abra in Chile, I mentioned earlier, as we first got into this after the Phelps Dodge acquisition, we saw this as a project with a very limited life. Exploration, drilling, and analysis have shown a enormous sulfide resource that requires some investments to get water and power to it, and to develop the mine, but this is a Cerro Verde type project for the future. And we're doing the work to position us far. New Morenci has a mine called Safford which was also developed by Phelps Dodge right before our acquisition. It has an adjoining ore resource that's been known for years. As we now approach the completion of the mining oxide material at Safford we're looking at this Lone Star resource, which has the opportunity to provide additional oxide awards to extend the life of the facilities at Safford, but a huge, huge sulfide resource underlying it. We're doing work to see how to take advantage of that. I mentioned Morenci, Sierrita is a mine with significant molybdenum resource, but again very large potential resource development. All of these developments, I want to talk about them because of how it fits into our near-team financial strategy. We're retaining these opportunities to grow our company in the future, very simple. We are not going to start spending money on these capital projects until the market justifies it, so we'll have that underlying our company. In our short term, Kathleen and I talked to Red and his team about what could they do to mitigate production declines without doing major capital expansion projects, how to do it with minimum capital. And they are undertaking a project to deal with steepening pit walls around our company. By optimizing slopes, it will allow us to target opportunities, to minimize stripping and add ore. And this would result in lower cost and adding ore available for current production without having to do major development projects. This is a process that we're approaching very carefully, because we want to do it by adhering to our established safety factors for protecting pit walls, but it allows us to have the potential to accelerate ore in the medium term, add incremental ore to our reserves. We're in the early stages of this, but we're very encouraged about what we might be able to do with it, we'll be reporting to you as we go forward. Now at Grasberg. We are at a stage of this mine, where we're completing the mining of the open pit. And if you can see the schematic of the ore bodies, we are producing now from the DOZ, we've developed the DMLZ extension of the DOZ and it has commenced production and it will provide significant ore to us going forward. We are continuing for the development of the Grasberg Block Cave, which is the extension of the ore body beyond the pit limits and we're prepared to do that. It would allow us to continue operations beyond the depletion of the pit and began ramping up the Grasberg Block Cave by having this infrastructure development. We can't mine from the Block Cave until the pit is complete because we use block caving methods, which results in surface upsides. And an ongoing issue we've had is the need to have an extension of our contract because the funds we're spending to develop a block cave are for production that will largely be produced beyond 2021. And so, we've been having this ongoing assessment about whether to continue these capital expenditures; if we were to defer those, there would be significant adverse consequences, both for our company and for the government of Indonesia because it would defer the initiation of the ramp up of the Block Cave going forward in the future. Today we have access to the ore at the very lower limits of the open pit. That means we're not doing much stripping at all. It has very high-grade ore. Our mining rate is two-thirds lower than its maximum 43% lower. There is limited access to the pit, so that means it creates some operational issues for us. And in this quarter, we had a couple of things to deal with. One, we had as we talked about on our last call, a mechanical issue to repair with one of our big SAG mills, that was done more quickly than we anticipated. And we have experienced some issues with part of our workforce and this is the workforce that actually operates the big trucks and shovels in the Grasberg open pit. They've had some grievances. There's been some slowdown work there and it had an impact on this quarter's volumes. Couple of points to emphasize. Well, let me start by saying, we are working with the union and the workers to resolve these grievances, and we're making progress with that. And we believe that we will be successful in dealing with that. But it was lower volumes now, but that ore is not going away. It will be mined and produced in the future. It's a matter of timing. It may mean, it will likely mean, it will mean, let me \u2013 it will mean that we will be continuing to mine from the open pit into the early part of 2018 rather completing in 2017. So it's a short-term timing issue. We believe we have it solved. We're really focused on executing there and believe our team can do it. We do have with the Indonesian Government an export permit that will be required by the first week of, roughly the first week of August, it's August 8. We have been given assurances from the Mines Ministry and the highest levels in government that we would be able to get that permit and we expect to obtain it on a timely basis. Longer term, we are having ongoing discussions following up on our letter from October of last year about the long-term extension of our contract. Those discussions have been constructive with the senior officials of the government clearly recognize the need for investment more broadly within Indonesia, and to achieve that goal, they have commented publicly on the need to treat existing investors like Freeport fairly. There's been some political realignment within the President, the parliament in this first quarter \u2013 first half of the year, we believe all that's going to be positive for getting a resolution, and feel that the timing for doing that now as opposed to where it's been over the last six months is much more positive and we are going to complete following up on that. So, that's kind of where we are at Grasberg and I'll be prepared to follow your \u2013 answer your questions. Slide 14 just shows how really good our mining business is. It shows in 2015 when copper price averaged $2.42, our EBITDA matched our capital spending. Now in the first half, with the completion of Cerro Verde, the drop off in CapEx even at a copper price of averaging $2.16, EBITDA is significantly higher than CapEx, and as we look forward for the full year in 2016 with copper prices averaging for the remainder of the year at $2 to $2.50. We have substantially higher EBITDA than the $1.7 billion of expected CapEx for the year. The adjustments for EBITDA reflect the changes that are previously talked about in Grasberg, the sale of the interest of Morenci and other factors there, but it shows how profitable our business will be now and as we go forward. In the oil and gas business, we really had a focus on managing costs and enhancing, protecting the asset values. We reduced costs \u2013 outside capital costs by roughly $150 million, that's about a third or more reduction in G&A costs and resulting other costs. We've restructured the really large commitments under the three deepwater drill ships that we had contracts for. We talked about that last time and that's in the supplemental slides if you want to go back and review it. We have established production in the deepwater from five new wells that we drilled to tie back to our production facilities. There were three wells that hosting deep and two wells in the Horn Mountain area. I'll talk about the Holstein production because those wells, the production results have been disappointing. Disappointing for factors related to the quality of the oil and the nature of the reservoirs, and that's just what it is. But overall, the production from wells that we've previously drilled have come on as expected, unfortunately, these did not. But we have had favorable results from the development of the outside operator in large projects at Lucius and Heidelberg. The \u2013 we have achieved our goal of ending the subsidy of our oil and gas operations from the mining business. And you can see that on page 16, where we show the oil and gas EBITDA at various prices, CapEx in 2017 has been reduced to $600 million. And you can see that what kind of EBITDA we would have at various prices ranging from $500 million at $35 to $1.5 billion at $65. The deepwater business is built around these three assets, three production facilities formally owned by BP and Shell, and they are 100% owned, they have significant processing capacity and significant unused processing capacity, which creates value for both us and prospective purchasers of these assets. Our outlook for 2016 updated for our experience in Indonesia, continues to show copper sales of $5 billion (sic) [5 billion pounds]. Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Pound. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : 5 billion pounds. Our Sierrita mine, which we anticipate at closing, went to work and found ways of finding some volumes at a very attractive cost level that offset the lower production in Indonesia. Gold production reflects the Indonesia issues that we talked about. Molybdenum increased just because of \u2013 principally because of Sierrita and because of markets that have improved some; and oil production is lower. We have sold our interest in the Haynesville gas field and so those barrels equivalent are out. There has been an operational issue because of the gas plant problem in Pascagoula, Mississippi that's limited some of our production as well as a startup production at the \u2013 with our three new wells. Operating cash flows at $2.25 copper are modeled to be $4.5 billion with substantial leverage of $260 million for each $0.10 change in copper price. Unit costs are consistent with previous guidance and on this basis $1.06 per pound and capital spending is couple hundred billion dollars less than previous guidance. Our sales profile, as we look forward, from 2015 to 2016, we got the 5 billion pounds that I just talked about, that would drop in 2017 principally because of the sale, Tenke is the big factor there. That is expected to close later this year and would reduce volumes. You can see the gold coming out of Grasberg as we mine the end of the pit, and what our Molybdenum and oil sales would be. Our chart that we show each quarter for our EBITDA and cash flows show it over a range of $2 and $2.50. It shows operating cash flows ranging from $3.5 billion to $5 billion over those copper prices and then capital expenditures and we're going to manage this in relation to market conditions would be dropping from $6.350 million in 2015 to just over $3 billion this year to $2.3 billion in 2017. So, the cash flow numbers that we talked about earlier reflects substantial cash coming out of the operation of our business. Kathleen went over with you the 3(a)(9) exchanges, in which we were able to retire roughly $370 million of debt. We had a cost in terms of the share price of $311 million. We'll continue to look for opportunities like this. And then when we look at our balance sheet and our ability to manage it, not only do we have a plan of getting our debt down, which we would believe be by the end of 2017, we'll be at an acceptable level to allow us to focus on growth as market conditions allow. We also have ways of dealing with our near-term maturities of half the proceeds of the Tenke transaction will be used to reduce our bank term loans, pursuant to our agreement with the bank. The remaining half will then be available as cash to retire the deal with our 2017 maturities. So, we've dealt with 2016, 2017 and we're going to continually looking at capital market transactions to \u2013 with \u2013 let me just say non-equity capital markets transactions in a way to deal and maximize the maturity picture going forward. So, this is a little chart we use as we talk about proving our mettle for this year in an enthusiastic and resilient manner. And I'm pleased to report for the first six months we've had a great track record of doing that and moving our sales forward on a really clearly defined business and financial strategy. So, thank you for bearing with me with all of that. It felt like it's an important quarter to cover these things and now I look forward to your questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotiabank: Hi, good morning. I was wondering if we could get a bit more color on Grasberg, specifically your five-year outlook for production really hasn't changed that much the last couple quarters, I'm just wondering how we should think about that production profile as you differ CapEx spending given the uncertainty on the COW extension. I mean at some point I would think that's going to have some impact on that, sort of post 2017 outlook, any color there would be extremely helpful. Thank you. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right, Orest. Yeah, yeah, that \u2013 you know, that's a good point. While we have found some ways and we continue to search for ways to differ capital, we changed the mine plants and have done certain things. What we have not done yet, what we have not done yet is differ the necessary steps that would allow us to begin ramping up the Grasberg block cave production once the pit is completed, now that would be early 2018. So the balancing act and this has been a major point of focus for us in the first half of the year. I went to Grasberg and I sat down with our team, we did a detailed review of what it would mean if we were simply to defer the spending of the $1 billion a year that we've been spending recently to develop this underground resource. What would happen, it would be significant layoffs and we're over 90% of the economy in Mimika. The resulting social disruptions there, which is \u2013 which are a significant concern are unknown. If for sure we do what you just said, it would result in a deferral for the ramp up of the Grasberg block cave. And once you did mobilize the team that's working on this, remobilizing that team and coming back in would be a significant exercise beyond just the time of spending it. And that would have a major negative impact as I said, both on us and on the government. Now we are basing our decision to do this on the assurances we've received from the government in recent years, but most clearly articulated in the October 8 letter last year that they will extend our contract. And recent \u2013 my recent discussions with the highest level of officials in the government reaffirmed that commitment to doing that. So, we are saying that we need to have that done in the near-term, explaining to them the consequences if we \u2013 to them as well to us of deferring those expenditures but to date we have not made that major decision. So, we're online \u2013 that work by the way has gone exceedingly well. And the underlying economics are strongly in favor of us doing what we're doing. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotiabank: Is there a specific sort of drop dead date in your mind that if you don't receive the COW extension by a certain point in time, you will sort of be forced to pullback the CapEx spend? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : There are some important dates along that line. One had been this August 8 this year, in the near-term for getting the extension of our export permit. We've been given assurance we'll get that. There is also an existing regulation in Indonesia. It's a government regulation, not part of the mining law that prohibits exports beginning in January 2017. That regulation is going to have to be changed or else that would be a major trigger point for us. And our contract provides that if the government takes actions in any way, but through large regulations that provides \u2013 that is inconsistent with our contract, then we have legal rights to pursue damages against that. We do not want to do that, we want to find a cooperative way of working this out with the government. The government is telling us they want to find a cooperative way of doing it so we're going to take advantage of this common ground that we now have to deal with it. But those, in response to your question, Orest, so that are the real trigger dates for us. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotiabank: And just so I remember, so the beginning of 2017 officially the Indonesia has banned all non-processed exports, is that correct? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's correct. That was \u2013 they had this 2009 mining law that was aimed at Indonesia exports of ore. We originally thought it didn't apply to copper concentrate. Two years later, there was a regulation passed that extended it to copper concentrate, and there was a regulation that said, no exports of this ore would be allowed beyond January 2017. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotiabank: Okay. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : There is a lot of pressures economically in Indonesia right now for them to relax that. The country financially would be harmed significantly by banning exports, and we don't think they're likely to do that. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotiabank: Okay. Thank you. And just as a quick follow-up. The reduction in Africa sales guidance for copper this year, does that reflect an actual reduction in your volume or is that just the closing date, affected by the closing date of 10-K, i.e., you think it's going to close before year-end? Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Yeah. That's what it is. We've forecast through a fourth quarter kind of middle fourth quarter closing date. So, we've just forecast what we would have through that closing date. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotiabank: Yeah. Harry M. \u201cRed\u201d Conger IV - President & Chief Operating Officer \u2013 Americas and Africa Mining : Second quarter was a record that I think we've never produced more copper in a quarter than we did last quarter. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Red. In terms of \u2013 that was great. Yeah. Now the operation there is going great. Our team is cooperating, our work with China Moly as we plan transition is going very well. China Moly is committed to maintain the quality of operations, the standards of environmental, and social programs and so forth. So we're working very cooperatively with them, everybody \u2013 I think everybody knows this but China Moly is a non-state owned Chinese company. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotiabank: Thank you very much. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Hi, guys. Just had a couple questions on operations and also the balance sheet. Maybe just start on slide four, where it's good to get the progression I guess in the net debt, does that include the $1.5 billion equity raise, just to be clear on that... Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, it does not. Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Okay. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, it does not. And it doesn't include, it doesn't include ATM proceeds, it doesn't include any sale of oil and gas assets, it does not include any sale of additional shares in PT-FI. Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Okay. Thanks very much. And then just I guess a broader question on your CapEx and cost reduction targets you've been able to achieve and I saw that you mentioned another $150 million, are you able to just step through how \u2013 the composition of that and how you look at 2017 and beyond and whether the cut now in your CapEx have to be caught up I guess in 2018 and beyond or whether they are sustainable? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, the $150 million you referenced is a cut in non-capital cost with oil and gas group, that's G&A and other cost that might be reported as lease operating expenses, for example. That reflects a major reduction in employment there, and we're still working on cost for office facilities and other support facilities, so that is sustainable. We had previously, beginning in 2015, although we've had a culture of doing this all along, have been very tough on managing costs in our mining business. Part that over time where we may end up having to increase some cost is \u2013 Kathleen has been work really strongly with Red and his team about reducing maintenance capital in the mining business. And we've done a great job in cutting that back. Over time, we may have to spend a bit more capital in maintaining our facilities and so forth. But other than the Grasberg investments that I just talked about, we don't see major new capital projects in the mining business until the market warrants it. Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Yeah. And we're managing \u2013 what you might be referring to, Chris, is the CapEx budget that we've reduced from $3.3 billion to $3.1 billion in 2016 and we've got slightly higher, about $100 million higher in 2017 than the previous estimate. But we're continuing in this market environment that we're in to emphasize deferring spending, our team has done a great job in finding ways to use equipment that we have, we talk about buying at home. And so the real focus is on cash flow net of CapEx and we've got the whole organization measuring on those bases. So we're working on lower for longer and we hope that that turns, but we do want to try to have sustainable long-term cost savings, both operating cost and capital savings as we go forward. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And I just want to say this, we had all of our mine managers that work under Red together week before last and we have a great team, everybody is highly motivated, understands the issues, working to achieve these objectives. And I'm really proud to be part of the team. Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Okay. Thanks \u2013 thanks for the color. And just one final one, I guess, maybe even over the last three months or so if we really want \u2013 there, it seemed to be more about doing another asset sale whereas now just hearing the tone of the conversation seems like if you'd complete the equity raise and copper stays about where it is, you can get through without that, but you continue to assess it, is that the right way to read it? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It is. I mean, we started off the year saying that every asset we had was up for consideration for sale. And we made progress. We continue to have discussions. But we're still telling the market and tell bankers if you got ideas for our business, come share them with us. And we've had a lot of interest and a lot of discussions. And that's what I talk about the balancing act, the balancing act is what we could raise, what will we be left with to build a company around, and \u2013 whereas at the beginning of the year, we didn't know, we thought we might have to sell some of these core assets, we thought we might have to sell Cerro Verde. We had a lot of interest in it. So, you're exactly right, with the plan we have now, as I said definitely now, if you like, we've turned the corner, we can see the way forward, without further asset sales, without further equity sales. We still have strategic decisions to make about the oil and gas business and about PT-FI shares as part of our arrangements with the government and we've got market uncertainties that we're going to have to monitor as we go along. But as I said, we see clarity now that we didn't have before and that clarity shows us the way to get to where we wanted to get to without having further asset sales. And so, if we can have an asset sale that would be less dilutive than an equity sale, that's the way we evaluate it. We want to do the \u2013 we want to get to where we need to get to in terms of having good balance sheet and do it in the most, the least dilutive fashion that we could get to. Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Thanks, Richard. I appreciate it. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, Richard and Kathleen. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Evan. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, first question just on 10-K. I was hoping you could address I don't know if I'd call them red flags, but a couple of issues with the closing, one is DRC has obviously raised some objections to the deal. And I was wondering how are you \u2013 what's behind that, do they have any sort of legitimate claim and what that might cost if anything to push that aside, could that delay the deal? And then the second point was recently Lundin got a five week extension on their right of first offer, what was behind that, and could that similarly potentially delay the deal, I know you have to get this thing closed by December 31. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. We have had just a great relationship with the \u2013 Freeport with the Government of the DRC. I mean, it was rocky at the start, but we've built a great relationship. We've operated the mine in a first-class fashion. We've had a great relationship with G\u00e9camines, it's a state-owned company that owns an interest in Tenke Fungurume Mining and an exceptional relationship with Lundin, our partner there. We sold Lundin, our Candelaria mine in Chile. So \u2013 and we love the asset, I mean, we really like to having this part of our portfolio. So when circumstances required to sell it, everybody was disappointed. We were disappointed, Lundin was disappointed, G\u00e9camines was disappointed, the government was disappointed. So, we've had it and this was not unexpected. So we had to deal with that disappointment. We have confidence that CMOC, China Moly, is a good partner and they are going to be a good partner for the country, and they're taking steps to explain that both to Lundin and to the G\u00e9camines and the government. The government would obviously like to get some financial compensation out of this, but legally, this is a transaction that does not relate to Tenke Fungurume Mining, which has the contract with the government, it's had a higher tier company, and there is no legal basis for anything other than continuation. So, the China Moly and Lundin are having discussions together about the future, Lundin has certain transfer rights that are publically known, and they mutually made a decision that they would like to have some additional time to consider that those transfer rights in their partnership going forward. We don't expect any delay. China Moly is reporting to us the approvals that they are getting in China and they have a strong economic interest to getting this thing closed, and we expect them to do it. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks for that. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And they really emphasized in their communications process that the benefits to the government of the Congo and employees and the community will be sustained going forward. There is no changes in that. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. And then second question just on leverage, I appreciate that slide that you put out there where you thought you'd be from a net debt perspective at various copper prices at the end of 2017. I was wondering, if you roll that forward in 2018, I know that's going to be a year where some of the production drops off at Grasberg. What is kind of a debt level as far as a ratio goes on a net debt to EBITDA? Where do you want to be at the end of 2018? What's kind of the minimum or, say, maximum leverage ratio that you would like to be at by the end of that year? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, as we go forward, because we're constraining capital so much, we continue to generate even at the lower Grasberg volumes excess cash flows. In 2018, it's essentially breakeven, but if you look forward beyond that, as Grasberg grows and ramps up, we have a future of generation of excess cash flows. And we will continue moderating the time that we start reinvesting in our copper resources based on market conditions then. And as we look at what the debt levels would be, there won't be any arbitrary ratios and so forth, but it would be based on a then assessment of what market risks are, market conditions are. And I'm looking forward to the time when Freeport returns again to thinking about increasing dividends and returning cash to shareholders. So we have a future that allows us to look forward to that day, based on the rectification of our balance sheet now that we've got the clear line of sight after dealing with the losses we had from this oil and gas deal. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for that. I'll turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Quail with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Richard, Kathleen, thanks very much for the update. Just a couple. First on gold at Grasberg, obviously, it's heavily weighed to Q4 this year. Looks like the grade's going to have to jump up almost to 50% from our numbers. Looking into 2017, obviously, there's a big jump in gold. It's good for grade. Is that going to be evenly spread next year or is it going to be similar to this year and backend loaded? Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : There will be variability from quarter to quarter and a slight change in grade can have a big impact, but we expect, as you see, with 2.5 million ounces that's our share, we'll have a strong quarterly gold volume throughout 2017. There will be some variability, though. Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Is it going to be frontend... Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And... Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And, Andrew, this is something we've been seeing and talking about since the production of the \u2013 going back to 1998 when we first set out on this. We designed the ultimate pit limits and so forth, this has been in our plans ever since then. Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And the thing that Kathleen's talking about as we get down to the bottom of the pit, there is only one access road. And so depending on how things go, just a little bit of change in where we mine or production issues can push things from quarter-to-quarter. Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes. And then on CapEx guidance for 2017, looking from Q1. It's pretty steady, the $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. Does that include Tenke, or has Tenke been taken out of that? And how does that remain constant? Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Yes. We resumed the Tenke sale in the fourth quarter, so that does include any CapEx from Tenke. We had scaled back way back the CapEx from Tenke in 2017 following completion of the asset plan this year. So we had very little capital in any case projected previously for Tenke. Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So that's what for next year in 2017? Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Correct. Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : It's out, but it wasn't large. Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Yes, it was less than $50 million. Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then is there any hedging on any of the oil and gas? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks, guys. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen & Co. Please go ahead. Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, Richard, Kathleen and Red. I wanted to start off with a question on oil and gas. I see the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has set up some new requirements as it pertains to plugging and abandonment liabilities. And I'm wondering if you can discuss the ramifications and does this shrink the pool of potential acquirers of the oil and gas business? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's a good question, Tony. These are new rules and the process was started mid-year last year, rules have been published, but how the rules would be administered is still unclear and our team is monitoring this, prepared to work with the government on it. And all can say is we're going to work with them and deal with it as best we can. We've had experience with this, as you well know, Tony, because we have to deal with financial assurance obligations with states in our mining business now and the Federal government through EPA is talking about this. So this is a growing area of emphasis and globally with events that have happened has put this on emphasis for. So we just have to deal with it. We've got uncertainties and we'll report to you as we go along. But you're right, Tony, this has had an impact on potential buyers. It's a different situation from an established operator in the deepwater to having either a smaller company or a financial buyer, which would have to deal with these in different ways because the way the government has historically administered, and we're unsure exactly how it's going to go forward, but they've provided some waivers into these kinds of obligations depending on the scope of an operators' operations in Gulf. Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Richard, I want to make sure I understand a comment you made when you were talking about turning the corner with all that you've done to date without the need for further \u2013 I wrote down copper asset sales, but did you say without the need for further asset sales in total including oil and gas? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: No. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, let's see, to make sure I can address this in a right way, without a need to do it, but strategically beyond just meeting the financial objectives of balance sheet management could lead us to make decisions about selling interest in PT-FI shares or doing something with the oil and gas assets. But we're not forced to do anything now to meet our financial objectives. We've got a plan that allows us to do that and now we can step back and deal with these other things strategically rather than as financial imperatives. Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Understood. To garner the best valuation possible type of thing? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's correct. Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: And just if I can go back to Indonesia, with so much complexity there, I was hopeful that the government would treat you guys more kindly since Newmont basically announced it's going to be selling out of Indonesia. And I'm wondering, has there been any change in tone since we saw those developments? And obviously, it's not a done deal and there's probably a lot of complexities involved there. But I'm just wondering, how all these moving parts could play out? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. I would tell you the tone we've had with the senior government officials has been good for some time now. I've had the chance of watching President, Joko Widodo closely, as he's been in United States and as he talked internationally about foreign investment and so forth. And there is not an issue of tone there. Within the country politically there is a feeling of resource nationalism, which is true of lots of places around the world today. And with us what's going on here in United States, but I'm convinced the President and senior advisors understand the issues from an Indonesia standpoint. We've had some complicated political circumstances in Indonesia over the past, say, nine months or so. And those have made progress. And I think that's had more of an impact on my sense of where we are. The Batu Hijau Mine that Newmont managed and had a significant interest in, it's apples and oranges to Grasberg in terms of size, grade, profitability and so forth. And I think the country is taking pride that an Indonesian group is stepping up to buy it. Many people there would like to see Indonesians own more of PT-FI. Biting off, managing Grasberg is a whole different situation than managing Batu Hijau just in terms of its complexity and its location in Papua and the development of the underground resources and environmental management, et cetera, et cetera. So I think the other factors are more of encourage to me than the Batu Hijau Mine. Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. It did look like it was \u2013 I mean we can believe what we read. It looked like a pretty good price for an asset that's got a much smaller reserve base, well one-twentieth of what I think of what you guys reported at Grasberg though, but that's one thing that that kind of caught my eye in that as well? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I'm afraid that Newmont... Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Lower quality too I think. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I'm afraid that Newmont were pleased with the transaction. We are working with the government to have them understand the fair value of our asset. Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Understood. Thank you. Thank you very much, Richard. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : Thank you very much for taking the question and congratulations. Looks like you've just about made a profit from not counting the $291 million impairment. Could you talk a little more about the six copper sulfide projects you're studying, El Abra and I guess five in the U.S.? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : And if there is one or two of them, it really seems to be a barn burner with a lot of upside, maybe a better grade or a lower strip, and if the better one or two of them are, say, 120,000 ton a day grinding mill expansions as opposed to the 240,000 ton a day at Cerro Verde. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Right. So, let's start at El Abra because, John, these are like Cerro Verde, relatively low-grade deposits that are very large. And so to make them economic, you need to have substantial grinding capacity \u2013 processing capacity. So Cerro Verde, what's good about it is the exploration work we're doing, the core drilling has to find the resource, so we don't have the risk of the resource. The issue is and it's things that we do. Execution of the plan is something we're very confident about. It's just the capital to build the desalination plant and then transports that water form sea level up to \u2013 Red, what's the... Harry M. \u201cRed\u201d Conger IV - President & Chief Operating Officer \u2013 Americas and Africa Mining : To 10,000 feet. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : 10,000 feet, and then build the processing facility. That's a lot of capital. So that's basically what you have there. In the U.S. there is similar situation at Bagdad. It's very large low-grade deposit. And we have those similar situations in Chino in New Mexico, Morenci. The one project that really looks exciting in the U.S. that has a little different characteristic to it is the Lone Star deposit. And we've talked about Lone Star since 2007. But now we are reaching the end of the oxide life of Safford. We have those facilities. And we can work our way in the Lone Star by mining the oxide cap there, which will allow us to use these facilities that are available in the adjoining Safford mine, and that would ultimately expose an enormous sulfide resource, big, low grade, which would allow us to take a step towards getting the benefit from it and then have the opportunity to do a large scale concentrator development. There is also a sulfide deposit at depth at Safford. And so how we deal with those together gives us a way to phase into it that's not available with other projects. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : When you say there's a sulfide deposit at depth at Safford, you're referring to the prior pits, not Lone Star? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's correct. This is the sulfide below the existing oxide. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : So there's a lot of fun you could be having with grinding mills over the next five years or 10 years? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Absolutely, and I want to tell you, that's been the strength of our company. The early development of the SAG mills at Grasberg was a big deal. The development now of high-pressure grinding roll mills at Grasberg and Cerro Verde that's one thing that allowed us to do Cerro Verde in such an efficient way. And then Red, talk a little bit about new mill at Morenci. It's amazing. Harry M. \u201cRed\u201d Conger IV - President & Chief Operating Officer \u2013 Americas and Africa Mining : John, at Morenci, we're doing 75,000 tons a day through one high-pressure grinding roll. And we've had days that approached a 100,000 tons. So those are low-energy consumption, high-efficiency, and they also help with recovery more than what we see in SAG mills. So we're very pleased with all of that. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, it's brand new technology and it's amazing to see how much material can go through it at such a smaller size than the big SAG mills that I was used to at Grasberg and at what energy efficiency. So it's fair to say that we're at the cusp of technology and operations throughout the copper mining industry and that's what we do. We're going to be very disciplined. I want to call everybody else, we're planning at this point, John, to work on it and our team is really excited about it. But we're going to be very disciplined about spending capital and we're going to be confident that the market needs this copper we're producing. It will need it, I'm confident of that. It's just a question of time. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : Thank you very much. Harry M. \u201cRed\u201d Conger IV - President & Chief Operating Officer \u2013 Americas and Africa Mining : Thank you, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Hi. I just have a question on slide 16, when you talk about the CapEx profile for the oil and gas business and the various amounts of EBITDA that can be generated at different oil and gas prices. I guess, my question is to what degree is that run rate of EBITDA sustainable with that level of $600 million CapEx, and will there be an eventual reinvestment cycle, so to speak, in that business in terms of having to invest more CapEx in order to be able to maintain the same amount of production from those wells? I guess, what's the life of production with the 2017 run rate as it's indicated on slide 16? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, that's what we're spending a lot of time on with our team in Houston. I was just there last week. And that was the key focus of what we're talking about. You're right in saying the nature of oil and gas production in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico involves inherent declines. But we have the benefit for several years now of wells that were drilled since we acquired Plains in 2013 that we have hooked up and have begun production on. And the effect of that is deferring the time when the decline hits us. So sort of like what we're doing here in the mining business, we're looking at different scenarios of where can you invest over time at the lowest risk, minimizing capital kinds of investments to arrest that decline. So we have several years to deal with that, but looking out in the long-term future would require reinvestment to maintain these levels of production. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And respectively for buyers, there's ways of growing, because we've identified a number of potential drilling opportunities that don't require new platform development, because we have all this unused capacity in the existing platforms. So there is great opportunity here. It does require capital and in the deepwater a significant capital, time lags for it to bring production on stream. In this Vito basin area, there is tremendous opportunities, and that's what I'm saying is strategically we're saying, our focus is going to be on the copper business. We want to make sure that if we talk to people about buying the assets or joint venture relationships or people we might want to come in overtime and invest with us to help minimize our capital, these are good assets and there is great opportunities for it. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Will there be an auction, say, to run the assets for cash flow at these kind of levels as indicated in the slide? And then if that were to happen and the wells were to deplete, per se, would you still then be able to maintain the optionality of having those reserves in the ground, or is there a certain point in time where you would have to spend in order to be able to maintain that optionality? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : There is certain things you have to spend. One of the things has to do with partner commitments. In other words, you'll have other partners in some of these opportunities and you'd have to participate or not. And if you don't, you lose the opportunity. There are some timing on lease requirements. So we have some flexibility, as I said, for several years, but long-term to be in this business, you've got to have a reinvestment opportunity and you've got to have a view for growth. Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : So we've restructured the business in a way where we don't have required commitments, but we are working with the team to develop capital allocation strategies that allow us to retain value in the assets, while not requiring CapEx above the cash flow being generated. So we're developing plans to allow that business to continue to generate cash to cover its CapEx. And because of the money we've spent historically, the lease acreage position we have, the strategic position we have around these strategic platforms, we do have organic inventory that we can manage over time, and that's what we're really trying to do. Like Richard said, if another buyer came in, they may do things differently than what we are doing, but we're allocating capital to the business in a manner that protects the asset values but doesn't require cash above its internally generated funds. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And I'll say this, in \u2013 my direct management of this group really started this quarter, and we have a really good professional team of technical guys running that business. They are impressive. They're recognized within the industry. My biggest concern was safety, as you can imagine, and everybody is committed to having safety as a first priority. They're really good guys, really know what they're doing. And we've worked out arrangements with them to be consistent with our corporate strategy. So I feel very good about the way all that's working. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay, great. I mean do you think we should see an updated capital allocation strategy, say, by the end of this year or the end of 2017? is that...? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Listen, we're going to give you a quarter-by-quarter update of where we are... Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We here at Freeport have a tradition of every quarter assessing where things are. We don't wait for any annual planning session. It's a continual basis of allocating capital, making decisions and we're going to inform you guys of how we're doing that. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. A lot of them have been addressed, but I may have missed one thing. I wanted to ask a little bit more. Just on the oil side, what was the reason for the roughly 16% decline in the guidance for 2017 versus three months ago? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Well, the big issue had to do with these three new wells that we had at what we call Holstein Deep. These wells were drilled. The logs on the well, electric logs that analyze the reservoirs prior to getting production were very strong. Unfortunately, there were limits because of the nature of the wells, the depth and so forth of where certain aspects about the quality of the oil, the permeability, the viscosity were simply not available and the initial projections were based on analogists' data from the area, from other experiences, and so there was just limited data. This is common in the industry. And when these wells came on-stream, it was readily apparent that the crude oil quality, the in-situ permeability throughout the field was different than expected. The viscosity was measurably higher than pre-test expectations. And so, it was just a case of where the wells weren't able to produce what they were expected to produce. And it was fairly significant. At the outset, the three wells, we were looking at 24,000 barrels a day, that we had lowered it a bit for our second quarter plans, but they're producing at 8,500 barrels a day, 9,000 barrels a day now. Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Dave, and another factor is the sale of the Haynesville gas which impacts volumes, but not really cash flows. So, you have probably two-thirds from well performance that Richard talked about, but a one-third of it is related to this Haynesville transaction which we report on equivalent basis, but it really had very little impact on our cash flow for 2017 net of capital spend. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Industry standards have this equivalency at six to one, relatively sales prices today are 15 to 1. So, we were calculating barrels equivalent to six to one. And I went back and looked and since we acquired Plains, we've had basically zero cash flows out of Haynesville. And yet that's going to show up as that number of barrels equivalent is just a problem with the way the industry reports stuff. David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just stepping back for a second, the bigger picture commentary that you made throughout the call regarding turning the corner and really addressing the balance sheet issues. As you look ahead now to 2018 and beyond, Cerro Verde is ramped, Morenci expansion is done, obviously pretty significant drop off here at Grasberg that we've all known about or should have known about. But still, where do you see the best \u2013 what do you \u2013 I'm trying to figure out where the growth is going to come from basically in 2018 and beyond, do you turn to investments outside of Freeport, that's a bit capital constrained obviously, but I don't really have a good source of growth, I'm wondering if you could help me out there? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, that's what the market is leading us to right now. We could well have a period of time of where we will have announced new projects to develop and being engaged in developing them, just like we were in 2011 to 2016 with Tenke, Morenci and Cerro Verde. If market conditions improve by then, what you could hear us say is, okay, we're going to start on these projects, we're going have this capital plan to execute it and it's going to take time to execute it. And so, the stock at that point will be reflecting that growth plan, we might depending on market conditions have excess cash flows. I'm fine with having those excess cash flows go to shareholders. We clearly could be in a position of being re-engaged in the market looking for other opportunities, but that's an option. We wouldn't feel any imperative to do anything other than focus on building our business long-term and if we have cash flows returning to shareholders. To me philosophically, that's what a natural resource company ought to do, not feel compelled to invest just because you're having money, but have the opportunities to have capital discipline, good rates of return, show how growth would occur through that process. I keep telling all these people who are sitting on the other table about negotiating right now, I wish I were in your shoes, I wish we had a company where we could be buying assets now rather than selling, but we're not, we can't wish that away, we are what we are. But look, Dave, I'd be fine to be in that condition, to have good markets, long-term investments and if you generate excess cash, overfunding those investments, get a right capital structure to the earlier question about what would be a good debt level to have in that environment; if you got excess cash, pay your shareholders. David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Sussman with Clarkson. Please go ahead. Jeremy Sussman - Clarkson Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. Richard, I just want to go back to something you said early on in the call where you noted that you were open to everything essentially. And if I heard you correctly, I think you said including the sale of the company. Just trying to interpret this, is this a process that's sort of actively ongoing or is it more along the lines of somebody brings you an attractive offer, the board is obligated to consider this as usual? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Right. Well, you're right. There are legal obligations that as a public company board is saddled with. But look, there is one thing that we share with our board now and our management team, we're all in this to build shareholder value and I mean we're all committed to it. We're all trying to find the best way to do it. My only point was, that's what we're about. That's kind of like my response to Dave's question about investment in growth. So, we've told the world that you know if there is some way of generating shareholder value now that's reasonable and attractive, there is not going to be barriers to our company considering it. Jeremy Sussman - Clarkson Capital Markets LLC : Understood. That's very helpful. And just the only quick follow-up I have. The $1.5 billion ATM to reduce I think \"ongoing indebtedness.\" Is there a particular focus such as some of the shorter dated maturities or how should we think of the proceeds here? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, it's going to be used as an overall management process of what makes sense. We had a later slide that showed that we basically covered our maturities through 2017. And so, we're going to be examining how to manage those maturities for 2018 forward and this will be part of the ingredients that go into that analysis for it. But there is nothing specific that we've targeted for right now. Jeremy Sussman - Clarkson Capital Markets LLC : Understood and good luck. Thanks very much. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jeremy. Appreciate it. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with FBR & Company. Please go ahead. Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hey, good morning, everybody. Richard, earlier in the call you mentioned trigger dates in Indonesia in fairly short order, August 8 and then January again, I wondered would you also expect kind of a final word so to say on the smelter and also the progress on the divestiture within that timeframe of call it six months or so? Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you, Lucas. Those two specific issues are part of a package of resolving our contract situation. We've been very clear with the government. We can't build a smelter without a contract extension. I mean that is a major construction progress. We've done a lot of work on it, we've got site selection done, we're working with preliminary engineering, design, we've got a real clear view of what it would be required. But we can't spend significant capital on it without having a contract extension, just think about it. We start today, the smelter construction period extends at least into 2019. And if you don't have assurance from your contract, you're not going to build a smelter and not have that assurance. The same way with divestiture, we've indicated a willingness to invest even though our contract award has no requirements that we do legally in terms of trying to meet the aspirations of people of Indonesia and its government, we've said we would divest an incremental 20%-plus. But again, that would only happen if we have a contract extension. The valuation of this business, if you just say we got a contract through 2021 is unreasonable based on the investments that we make. The investments we've made has been to develop this resource for the next 25 years. And for our shareholders, we couldn't sell it without getting a return on those investments and a fair valuation for operations extending over the next 25 years. So, that's conditional in the contract as well. Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then my second question is regarding 2018. I wondered if you have maybe a date in mind for issuing that initial guidance, I'm kind of looking forward to how production would evolve longer term given Grasberg and then also on the O&G side there, your investments there. So, do you have any date in mind for disclosing that 2018 production outlook? Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Well, we do disclose the five-year outlook for Grasberg. So, you can see the impact in between 2017 and 2018 in Grasberg principally on total volumes. And we'll be updating our numbers in a little bit, we haven't set a date for disclosing 2018 on a consolidated basis, but the biggest impact you will see is the decline at Grasberg in 2018. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And that's slide 30, Lucas. Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, got it. Cool. Well, thank you very much. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Let me just say one thing about slide 30. It's out of perspective because we've always, as I mentioned this earlier, we were always going to have these exceptional years in 2016, 2017 because we're down at the bottom of the pit, high grades, no stripping, et cetera. So, historically, we never expected as we first got into this expanded operations at Grasberg in 1998 to be able to have this level of production of copper and gold after the pit expired. The resource has grown so much, the way that we process it has been established. So, these numbers are pretty \u2013 relatively consistent with what we had before these exceptional years in 2016, 2017. So the resource is very large in terms of both the copper and gold production, the unit cost will be low, it's a world-class asset beyond 2017. Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Great. Thank you very much. Kathleen L. Quirk - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Yeah. And I think also, just one follow-up on that. It also is going to be market driven as well. We still have some production curtailed. And so, that will be, our mine plans will be reviewed on an ongoing basis depending on market conditions. So, both in North America and South America we've got some production that's still curtailed. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. And just as a point of information, this is net of Rio Tinto's interest here. After 2021, Rio Tinto has 40% as a joint venture partner in this. These numbers which you see on slide 30 are not consolidated, but net to Freeport. Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Yeah, got it. Great. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Operator : And I will now turn the call over to management for any closing remarks. Richard C. Adkerson - Vice Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We could go on forever and some might say that indeed we have today. So, at any event, we wanted to try to answer your questions, we appreciate your attention and we are available to follow-up through David Joint if you have further questions. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer. We also have several members of our senior operating team in the room including Red Conger, Mark Johnson and Mike Hendrix (1:40). I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results, and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be reviewing our recent performance and outlook. As usual, after the prepared remarks, we'll turn the call over for questions and answers. Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $217 million, or $0.16 per share for the third quarter of 2016. Our results for the quarter included net gains totaling $39 million, or $0.03 per share, which reflected non-recurring tax credits, partly offset by the impairment of oil and gas properties. After adjusting for this net gain, third quarter 2016 adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $178 million, or $0.13 per share. Our EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the third quarter totaled $1.35 billion. Our consolidated sales, including the volumes from Tenke Fungurume which is being reported as a discontinued operation following our agreement to sell our interest totaled 1.2 billion pounds of copper in the quarter, 317,000 ounces of gold, 16 million pounds of molybdenum and 12 million barrels of oil equivalent. Our copper and gold sales were lower than our July estimates, principally reflecting lower mining rates at the Grasberg mine, which affected the timing of access to higher grade ore, which we expect to recover in future periods. Our average copper price during the quarter was $2.18 per pound. That was below the year ago average of $2.38 per pound. Gold prices averaged $1,327 per ounce during the quarter, which was above last year's third quarter of $1,117 per ounce. Our average net unit cash cost net of byproduct credits totaled $1.14 per pound of copper in the third quarter, we continued our trend of reducing cash cost, they were $1.52 per pound in the third quarter of 2015. Operating cash flows during the quarter totaled $980 million, those cash flows exceeded capital expenditures of $494 million during the quarter. As we previously reported, we commenced a registered offering at the market equity offering of up to $1.5 billion of common stock during the third quarter, and during the quarter, we sold 33.5 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $415 million, which averaged $12.39 per share. We ended the quarter with consolidated debt of $19 billion and our cash grew to $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter. We had no borrowings under our revolving $3.5 billion revolver credit facility and as you'll see in the slides we have very little in the way of near-term maturity. We had $1.36 billion common shares outstanding at the end of the quarter, as you'll see in our release and as Richard will be discussing more in depth in his presentation, we have significant asset sale transactions that we expect to complete during the fourth quarter, a total of $5.2 billion which includes the previously announced transaction for our Tenke Fungurume stake as well as assets, oil and gas assets including the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and our onshore California properties. I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who'll be referring to materials, slide presentation materials on our website. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thanks, Kathleen. And good morning, everyone. We're here with a beautiful sunrise here in Phoenix and that's a good way to start our call off. We want to talk about where we've been and what we've accomplished here in 2016. It was a year ago, when our board acted to restructure our board and return our focus to our global leading copper business. And during 2016, we have made some significant accomplishments and we've positioned our company for the future with these significant copper resources and with an improved balance sheet. But, before I really talk about that, I want to address right at the outset the reason why our copper production volumes in this quarter fell short of the estimates. As you know, we are mining in the last phase of the Grasberg open pit. Some ways it's hard to believe, but we started developing it in 1990, and here we are at the very end of the pit. It is at this point, physically a very confined area right at the bottom of the pit, the ore body extends lower but we're going to mine that as an underground operation. But we have current mining in an area that's constricted but it has extraordinarily high grades of copper and gold, and these grades are increasing as we mine. During the quarter, our planned mining rate, the actual physical material we moved that was about 15% short of what we had planned. And as a result of that, we simply did not access as much of this high grade ore as we expected and what our plans projected. We'll talk more about this later and we're certainly disappointed with this mining rate. A lot of it has to do with some worker issues that we're addressing and we believe we can manage as we go forward. But we have the equipment, the mine designs, the people and the ore grades to allow us to mine this material, and so what we're faced now is the fact that we didn't get to it this quarter means that it's a timing issue. We will get to it as we go forward, we'll make up a lot of it in 2017, it will have an impact in the fourth quarter and we should finish mining it early in 2018, so this is not a valuation issue or a really significant economic issue but more of a timing issue. Now looking back fourth quarter of 2015 was a very difficult time, but as we went into 2016, the first half of the quarter was really, really tough as you'll remember. We set out on a path to cut our debt. In response to one of your questions in our year-end earnings call, you pressed me to say what was our target for debt reduction and I said $5 billion to $10 billion. At that point, to be really candid with you, the market was tough that we didn't \u2013 I really didn't have a clear cut view that, of how we were going to do it, but we were committed to do it. So we set on this path, now we believe we have clear sight to reducing our debt by $10 billion. And we executed this plan in a way after looking at a lot of alternatives that will enable us to retain a core set of assets that we'll build a great company around. It's characterized by long lives, good cost positions, long-term growth options when markets indicate that future investments will be needed and it will be and a balance of geographic diversity. And so we're really pleased here that we are \u2013 we have a clear path now for achieving these objectives. As an organization, we were already on a solid path to cut our cost and our capital spending and our global team has really stepped up to this challenge. We delivered completion of the Cerro Verde project on-time and on-budget. It was a very big complicated project and we moved quickly to adjust our operating plans and our capital spending at each one of our operations to respond to the situation. And our teams had a long history with this. The organization had operated at low grade mines in the U.S. for over 100 years and this has made the team that Red leads and Mark Johnson leads really good operators in dealing with this kind of environment. We operate all of our mines and so we can benchmark our operations and share best practices and people and resources around the company and across the portfolio. Our net unit cost averaged $1.14 per pound during the quarter and this is 25% below last year's third quarter, and before byproduct credits costs were down 20% over the year. And at each one of our sites, we have really focused on cash flow generation and we look at our performance net of sustaining capital cost and we've been very tough on capital at this point. And despite these low prices, our team is very enthusiastic and focused and energized to maximize cash flows. During 2015, our CapEx exceeded our cash flows. That was primarily because of the oil and gas business. We worked hard to reverse this and generated $500 million in cash flows above CapEx in the third quarter. And we expect to be able and are confident we can continue to generate free cash flow over the next several quarters, even at low prices, because we're going to constrain capital spending, until the market warrants new investments, and that will contribute to our debt reduction \u2013 achieving our debt reduction targets. Year-to-date, we've announced $6.6 billion in anticipated proceeds from asset sales transaction. This does not include potential additional consideration of $680 million. We've to date received proceeds of $1.4 billion and expect to receive $5.2 billion by yearend from transactions that have \u2013 are under contract, which we expect to close. So these steps will enable us to achieve our delevering objective of cutting our debt in half by the end of 2017, but keeping a really strong set of assets that over the long run will enable our shareholders to benefit as the market recovers. Slide four, is a summary of our recent announcements of our oil and gas transactions. You'll recall that at the end of 2015, we announced a process to evaluate options for this business. Our board engaged special financial advisors, and we went into the marketplace to see in the first quarter if we could find a buyer for the whole business. Now that was a really tough time to try to find someone to buy a set of assets like we had in the oil and gas business, couldn't have been worse. And by the end of the quarter, in the first quarter of this year, we had concluded that we would likely retain these assets for a longer period of time. And that we'd hold onto them and wait for a market recovery. At that point, we reorganized our management of our oil and gas business. We changed it from being a standalone separate business to being a division of our company. We put together from the existing group a really effective operating management team. And so that was the plan going into it. After the first quarter and after we had announced what we were going to do, parties emerged with renewed interest, who are talking to us about buying sets of those assets. And so, we continued our process of discussions. I can assure you that we gave everyone in the marketplace the opportunity to come in and talk with us; people knew it. Bankers were out knocking on doors. And so, we really had a process that exposed these assets to the marketplace. And at the end of the day, we had a competitive process, and we reached a transaction in September to sell our production in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico to Anadarko. And then, in October, we've now announced a transaction to sell our production onshore in California. In the aggregate, we will receive $2.6 billion in gross proceeds and $300 million in contingent consideration. And I will assure you we thought long and hard, and had active discussions with our board about selling these assets during this period of weak oil prices and taking into account the current outlook for oil prices. And \u2013 but the nature of this oil and gas business is such that, because of depletion, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, it would require over time continued reinvestment to maintain the assets. If you didn't do that, they simply go away. And then, you have very significant reclamation obligations, and the government's rules for providing financial assurance for those reclamation obligations are being \u2013 are changing and requirements are likely to be more significant. And so, we took all that into account and concluded that these transactions were consistent with our strategy, and would allow us to focus on what our future is going to be. Now, I can tell you I've read analysts who assigned a much higher value to these assets than what we sold them to, a theoretical value. Buyers weren't willing to pay that. After a very extensive process that we went through I'm convinced we got very attractive prices for us. The purchasers will likely do well with these assets because they're good assets. But for our company, considering the total implications financially of continuing to be in that business and hold them, I'm very comfortable with what we did and really pleased that we were able to get that done. So, that is summarized on page 4, and I'd be happy to answer any questions about it. Now, we continue, looking at page 5, to progress the sale of our PT asset. You've all heard me say that this is an asset that we sold with great reluctance. It's a great long-term asset and fit very well in our portfolio, and I'm very proud of our team. When we started out in 2008 in developing it in a very challenging environment and going through the financial crisis and working on all of the issues of doing business there, it's been a real pleasure to do business in the DRC and work with the people there and see what our team has done. But it's also an asset that values are going to be realized over very long periods of time. And we were able to find a buyer at a valuation that's attractive in relation to near-term cash flows. And China Molybdenum, a privately owned Chinese company that's making global investments in the mining industry, is progressing their transaction. The process has gone smoothly. It is a public company, not a state-owned company, and they have gotten their shareholder approval and other regulatory approvals within China that was necessary to go forward with the transaction. And where we are today, there is still a condition remaining to close is resolving a transfer right that our minority partner, Lundin Mining, has in the property in contract. It's called the Right of First Offer or ROFO, and we've been working with China Moly and Lundin to resolve this. We've currently extended the timeframe for resolving it to November 15. You've also read that G\u00e9camines, the state-owned mining company in the DRC, has asserted that it has preemptive rights to this transaction. The transaction itself involves entities outside of the DRC at a different corporate level. We disagree with G\u00e9camines' assertion on this, and our legal advisors support our conclusion. But we're working with China Molybdenum, with Lundin, with G\u00e9camines and with the government, so that we can all find a way forward to work together to resolve this issue. China Molybdenum has strongly expressed their commitment to closing the transaction as soon as possible, and we're working together to find the appropriate resolution for the Lundin ROFO. We still expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter. It's $2.6 billion in proceeds and $120 million in contingent consideration, and we're also giving them exclusive rights to acquire an exploration property we have in the DRC and a downstream cobalt business. So all of that is working to get closed in the fourth quarter. So, putting this all together on slide 6, you can see the aggregate steps that we have taken. If we look at the completion of these asset sales transactions, completion of the previously announced $1.5 billion after-market offering, which to-date we have completed about 25% of that $1.5 billion amount. Execution of our operating plans, we expect to achieve our debt targets by the end of 2017. And we are well on our way of doing this. We have the portfolio of remaining assets that we want to keep. We're not planning additional divestments. We may take some steps to deal with the remaining assets in our oil and gas business, and we are prepared to divest at Grasberg an additional roughly 20% interest pursuant to our discussions with the Indonesian government. That is contingent on, conditional on getting our long-term rights extended on the basis of giving us fiscal and legal assurety, but we've \u2013 we're committed to the government to sell an additional 20% interest. That's not in these numbers. So, at the end of the day, we will have a reasonable balance sheet and industry-leading portfolio of copper assets that would be available for long-term development. And these are the sorts of assets in the copper business that at best are very, very difficult to replicate if at all possible. So, looking at those assets, on page 7, is an overview. We have \u2013 we will have seven copper mines, which will be led by Morenci, seven copper mines in North America, which will be led by our flagship Morenci mine, which is a fabulous operation. These mines are very long lived. It gives us long-term optionality on copper prices and future investment opportunities. We will have two mines in South America : the Cerro Verde mine, which today has the largest processing facilities globally and is operating very well; and the El Abra mine in Chile, which has very significant long-term growth opportunities for us as well as Grasberg. We've managed these assets successfully over a long period of time in different price environments and within these mines, we have significant growth opportunities that we'll be prepared to pursue when the time is right. And we show this on page 8 and this is our copper sulfide development opportunities, in alphabetical listing not a priority listing, we're still assessing from a priority standpoint, which ones we would attack first and even though we're not spending capital on these projects, we are spending effort to develop plans for future investments. And they are sulfide opportunities that we have identified through our exploration drilling and exploration analysis on very large ore bodies, where we can take advantage of existing infrastructure to add on to processing facilities that will allow us to develop these in a profitable way. Now, copper market commentary, copper price at today's levels is still very low and reflects the global economy and slowdown in China, but stepping back, the surpluses that were previously predicted are lower than what was expected. We've had recent supply growth and there is still a couple of projects being completed, we were a big part of that. We had three big projects that we started in the 2010 timeframe that have been completed now. And with the current projects being finished, the recent supply growth is not sustainable. These long periods of low prices will impact future supplies. Wood Mackenzie is showing a 4 million ton decline from existing mines in the next coming years, 2025. The top 10 mines in the world today produce less than 5.5 million tons of copper a year and Wood Mackenzie feels the incentive price to develop new mine supplies on the order of $3.30. Inventories have risen during the quarter, the reasons for that, the level still remains relatively low by historical standards. And when you look at the total marketplace, relatively or just say absolutely small increases in demand or supply disruptions could well move the market to deficit in a short period of time. Page 10 is a slide, I don't think we've used recently, but we've used over the years, which shows the 10 largest mines in the world in terms of reserves. In copper production, we have three of those mines at Grasberg, Cerro Verde and Morenci. You can see what I referred to earlier these top 10 mines in 2016 are, will be producing less than 5.5 million tons a year. So to replace 4 million tons in the future, in terms of what you're looking at is really a significant challenge for the industry. Other than Oyu Tolgoi and Los Pelambres, Grasberg is the most recent discovery in 1988, many of these mines were discovered back in the 1800s and here where on Grasberg completing mining of the open pit this year. So the point is, finding world-class mines is extremely rare. And now we're in a period of time where and this is where we've gone through over the last 15 years, extensive exploration when prices were high and companies were investing. So, even with all these investments, finding big new mines is really tough. And having these kinds of mines in our portfolio is going to prove very valuable 100% over time. We haven't had any big technology revolution in the copper mining business. We've made progress with technology and so forth, but copper as a commodity is very tough to replace. We haven't seen any shale oil type developments in our business. In fact, we're seeing SX-EW opportunities dry up, new opportunities are low-grade sulfide opportunities which require lots of infrastructure in the development, mining a lot of material to get the copper like we're doing at Cerro Verde. Now, what are we going to be doing in the meantime before we start reinvesting again, we're going to look for every opportunity we can to continue to reduce cost and increase production. One of these things and our challenge now, you see in our data we will have a fall off in production at Grasberg in 2018 as we make the transition from the pit to the underground at the Grasberg Block Cave. And so, we challenge ourselves to mitigate these production declines while we spend a minimal amount of capital. In the meantime, one of the things we are looking at is Pit Wall Design to optimize our slopes, to steepen pit angles to minimize stripping and add ore, and this can reduce cost as we add ore, and we're having a strict adherence to doing this in a safe way. But this is just one example of what we're doing to see if we can find ways of maximizing production safely, at a time when we're going to be making this transition and we'll be reporting to you on this as we go forward. I mentioned, page 12, talks about Grasberg, we had to deal with labor grievances, it had to do with some bonus issues and some issues about management supervisor relationships with the workforce. We had a 10-day work stoppage in late September, but this had caused us issues relating to worker productivity for a longer period of time, and was a principal reason why we had a shortfall in our mining rate. As I talked about earlier, this is a timing issue. The ore remains there, we're not seeing any questions about the grades in the ore or it's availability, and so, we've developed new plans which we've shared with you for how we will make up for this ore that we have failed to mine in the third quarter, and this carries over, because grades are increasing and so forth as we delay this, it has an impact on the fourth quarter. But, and it will extend by some period of time how long we'll be in the pit, it now goes into 2018. But we will mine this ore and the economic impact will not be significant. We continue to have discussions with the government, there are two really key issues. One is an existing regulation in Indonesia that prohibits exports of ores and the government has defined copper concentrate as an ore, even though it's a commercial project \u2013 product, which captures more than 90% of the value of copper metal, but under their regulations, they call it an ore, existing regulations prohibit the export of ores beyond January of 2017. There is a recognition in government that this needs to be addressed and I believe it will be, and we're working actively with the Ministry of Energy and Mines and other government officials on this issue. And then beyond that, the key issue for us is having the extension of our operating rights beyond the primary term of our existing contract, which extends to 2021. Under the terms of that contract, we're entitled to two 10-year extensions on the same terms as in the contract, and the government has agreed that it will not unreasonably delay or withhold approving that extension, but it hasn't been approved yet. So, those are the two things that we're working with. There's been a lot of political changes in Indonesia that have affected this, but we have a \u2013 we're committed to having a good working relationship with the new Minister, the new Vice Minister and the Ministry of Energy and Mines, and with the President and other government officials. And so we are working amicably to address these issues. It's important for Indonesia as well as for us and particularly important for the province of Papua. Page 13 shows our adjusted mining plan. We see the schematic of the pit in the underground Grasberg Block Cave, the existing underground production coming from the DOZ and the DMLZ mines. So we adjust this every quarter and you can see what our new outlook for copper and gold production is coming out of Grasberg, we give in the appendix longer-term projections, so you can see that. Our outlook for 2016 now is for 4.8 billion pounds of copper for the year, 1.26 million ounces of gold, and 73 million pounds of molybdenum. For the year, site cost net of by-product credits of $1.20, operating cash flows at $2.10 copper in the fourth quarter would be $3.6 billion, each $0.10 change in the fourth quarter of the delta of $150 million. And our CapEx for the year of $2.8 billion including over $1 billion for oil and gas which was actually a carryover from spending that was done in 2015. Our sales profile going into 2017 is shown on slide 15. You can see both our copper production now this takes out Tenke and the incremental interest that we sold at Morenci to Sumitomo earlier in the year, but the gold carry over from lower volumes in 2016, into 2017 and into 2018. Page 16 shows 2017 EBITDA and cash flows. This excludes all the oil and gas business, so essentially with the Deepwater and California sales, it excludes Tenke and it excludes the incremental interest at Morenci. And you can see EBITDA at $2 being just under $5 billion, $2.25 just under $6 billion, $2.50 million just under $7 billion. And operating cash flows of $2.6 billion, $3.4 billion and $4.2 billion within this range of copper prices. It excludes working capital changes, we expect a positive working capital impact in 2017. Capital spending. You can see just how our efforts we undertook to cut capital is unfolding. I mentioned the $2.8 billion for 2016 falling to $1.7 billion in 2017. That's essentially the spending that we'll be doing developing the underground at Grasberg as well as the constrained sustaining capital for the rest of our business. 18 summarizes where we are with our debt structure. You can see at 9/30, we had $19 billion of debt and $1.1 billion of cash pro forma for the asset sales transactions. But with no additional equity from the ATM offering, we would end the year with $3.3 billion in cash and our maturities for 2017 are $1.3 billion. So, we'll have ample cash to deal with our near term liquidity, and a good set of assets for dealing with our longer term balance sheet issues. So, we talked at the beginning of the year about execution and we are continually focused on that, as I mentioned we're disappointed about the mining rate issues at Grasberg, but are working on that every day, we're working on securing our long-term rights in Indonesia every day. We feel good about our plans for debt reduction, building long-term value and safety in our business is a challenging part of it. We certainly had our challenges in the third quarter, but that is the first thing we talk about whenever we meet with our team and that overrides everything that we do. So, thank you for bearing with me on this overview, and I look forward to your questions. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Operator, we're ready for questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from the line of Matthew Korn with Barclays. Please go ahead. Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi good morning, Richard and everybody. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Good morning, Matt. Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So, let me ask on this, you had the mining rate issues this quarter, you had the labor stoppage, and the implication seems to be that the problems over the third quarter that you saw are going to hamper production in the fourth quarter, effectively pushing some of that back into next year. Can you clarify are you more constrained in what you can produce over fourth quarter, because of these lingering issues or is this move around out of any kind of conservatism? I'm just trying to understand how much of the shift is you responding to conditions at the mine? And how much if any \u2013 is any market conditions positioning as you negotiate with the Indonesians, et cetera? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Okay. There is just a physical aspect to it. As we progress our mine plan at this stage, we get to higher grades as we go forward. So, the fact that we were not able to mine the material that we planned to mine in the third quarter, means it's just simply going to take longer to get to the higher grade material that we had originally planned to mine in the fourth quarter, and that gets pushed out. We can't do more to get to it quicker, because we're constrained by physical space. So, our plan calls for us to do everything we could do all along, and when it gets pushed back, it gets pushed back over time physically. So, it's not a \u2013 it's really not a strategic or tactical decision, but it's a physical consequence of what we face now. We know we've got to be diligent about keeping our equipment operating and available and so forth, because delays in that can have an impact in the future. We're working hard to address these issues of concern by our workers, we made some responsive steps to the issues they raised in terms of the bonus, in terms of the relationships between supervisors and the workers and that's an ongoing process that we'll have to work with, it's a complicated labor situation there in Papua with the nature of the workforce, and how it's changed over the years. All of this requires a lot of attention and a lot of work. What it doesn't change is that high grade ore that's there. I mean that remains there and it's a question of getting to it as quickly as we can. We want to do it \u2013 safety is the first issue, but we're not trying to do any of this in terms of positioning with the Government of Indonesia. We want to operate in an efficient straightforward way, that's been our history, and that's going to be our future. While we're doing this, I might add that our work in underground development is going extraordinarily well, I mean, we're meeting our targets in terms of development and putting things in place. We're getting approvals from the government to do what we need to do, that's a big project, that just kind of gets out of the spotlight here, but it's in total over time a $15 billion investment project, and we're spending roughly a $1 billion a year, and that's the future for us, and our partner Rio Tinto as we move forward, so, as we're dealing with these important issues near term in the pit we're also giving keeping great focus on the underground development and it's going very well. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And Matt you can see on \u2013 this is Kathleen, on slide 12, we show the grades of both copper and gold in the open pit. And because of the variability in the grade, we'll be mining in the fourth quarter, material that previously had a higher grade. But because we got the behind in the third quarter, we'll be mining material that we thought we were going to mine in the third quarter that has a lower grade. But we do expect to get to all of it because the open pit will be transitioned to the underground in 2018. So, that, as Richard talked about, it is shifting now by a couple of months the access to the higher grade material, and that cascades into 2017 and 2018. Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it, Kathleen. I appreciate the clarity there. Let me follow-up with a question for you, if I could. Looking at the language in your filings, there is the springing collateral trigger, and if the $3 billion kind of threshold in asset sales isn't reached, you've been very clear expecting \u2013 in laying your expectations for things still moving for the fourth quarter. But in a bad outcome, let's say anything happens with Tenke, anything happens with Deepwater, what kind of collateral would we be talking about? What would be that actually look like numerically? Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, the terms of our amendment that we did with the banks in the first quarter of this year have a springing collateral really for all of the assets. And so our plan was if we didn't get to the sales proceeds, the $3 billion, that we would sit down and discuss with the banks the nature of the collateral. But as it reads right now, it's basically all the assets. But we're very confident that we'll be able to meet that test. We've got three transactions. We've already completed a significant amount of proceeds already in the first part of the year. So, we're confident that we'll be able to meet that test and avoid the need to grant the collateral, that the springing collateral test that you referenced. Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thanks very much, folks. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And Matt, I'll just say, we have great relationships with our bank group. And this goes back for years of how we managed things historically after the Phelps Dodge deal, deleveraging that, how we managed the financial crisis in 2008/2009, how we dealt with the situation following the oil and gas leverage, and so we work very well. We have a lot of credibility, and so we'll continue to work together to represent each other's interests on this. Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks, Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Hi, guys. Just a couple of questions from me. Just following up on Grasberg. I'm thinking about that the transition period between the open pit and the underground. And so your latest mine plan, does that have the open pit finishing at around the end of 1Q 2018. Is that correct? And ... Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah, that's correct. Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): ...that transition would be sort of 2Q 2018, and is the underground all on track for that? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: The answer is yes. Mark Johnson is here. He can... Mark Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah, the Grasberg Block Cave development has gone on without any interruption. We expect to have the ore flow system, which is one of the main systems for the Grasberg Block Cave to come online, that will be available to us at the end of 2017 well in advance of the start of the block cave. By the nature of the block cave mining is such that we will not initiate the cave, but we can do a lot of the preparation for the cave prior to the pit completing. As soon as the pit is complete, then we start a process of initiating the Block Cave and then that ramp up process will take place with the capacity coming online as we develop more draw points. So, it's on track. The Deep MLZ, we initiated the cave earlier this year, and that continues to advance, and we're well positioned for that mine to continue to grow in capacity. By the end of the year, we'll be at 10,000 tons a day. Coming out of the Deep MLZ by the end of 2017, that will be up to 25,000 tons a day. So both of these mines would be in a ramp-up process over the next five years to six years to get them up to full capacity. Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): All right. Thanks. Thanks for the color. And then the last question from me, just on the SG&A, thinking about that going forward post the two transactions in the oil business : have you got any more updates on that or thoughts about how 2017 into 2018 might look? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yes. We're going through that process now and obviously taking the steps to deal with the significant SG&A we had in the oil and gas business. But we're also continuing to look at our corporate G&A and so forth, and our overall target is to return this to levels that were in place before we did the oil and gas deal and try to find ways of reducing that. Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia): Okay. Thanks, Richard. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Hi, Richard, Kathleen, Red and Mark. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Hi, Tony. Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, there. First of all, congratulations on all the progress so far. You've really been doing some tremendous things, so kudos. My question is I really wanted to drill down on Indonesia, and I was wondering, Richard, how would you describe the overall tenor of your negotiations with the government these days? Obviously there has been a lot of moving parts with the cabinet officials, et cetera? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Okay. And Tony, I know you're well aware of all this, but I just want to be clarifying. We haven't really been engaged in negotiations. We set a plan in the mid 2014 when we signed a memorandum of understanding about how to go forward, and that's when we agreed to pay higher royalties, to divest up to 30%, to develop the smelter in return for the government approving the extension of our contract beyond 2021 on the same fundamental terms as our existing contract and agreed to allow us to export. So since that time, it's been more of a question of talking with the government about getting that approved as opposed to continuing negotiating terms. And that MOU was extended once in early 2015, and in October of 2015 we received a letter from the government, basically affirming all of that. And so there has been lots of political changes in Indonesia. But we haven't been engaged in negotiations. It's just been more of a question of working with them to put in place the agreement that we've previously reached. Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: I guess I'm trying to get at has there been \u2013 in your discussions has there been a change in the tone, or are they becoming a little bit more accommodative, do you think? And would it be your expectation that we could see tangible progress on the export situation? Obviously, you've got the license right now, but would your expectation be that the 2017 situation would be resolved maybe in advance and not having to go down to the wire again, or is that...? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, I went back and I read my \u2013 the transcript from last earnings call, and we talked then about need to getting the August extension of our export permit at the time. We got that. Now, we're faced \u2013 as these all have done, that's has gone down to the wire. Now, we're faced with this January 2017 broader issue. It's not just a question of getting a permit for our company, but it's a regulation that affects a number of industries. It's not just copper, but it affects other industries as well. And the tone has been a recognition by the government that that needs to be addressed. How they address it is a matter of great interest for us. And as has been the case, there are a lot of different views expressed publicly by members of the DPR and certain members of the government, but we believe in our discussion, there is a recognition that this needs to be addressed and will be addressed. The discussions that we've had, the President has been very positive about the need for foreign investment and the need to treat existing investors well. The Vice President recently made some comments along this line. We've had this \u2013 the situation of reshuffling of the cabinet and the unusual situation of \u2013 with respect to the minister and so we are just having to deal with all of that and we keep emphasizing with the government our history of investment, the fact that we're providing work for over 30,000 people in Papua, the benefits that our operations have provided, and will continue to provide to the government and the government's fiscal situation is such that that this is important and then moreover the role we play in Papua. We're over 90% of the economy in the region, in the region where we operate, a majority of the GNP in the province itself. So all of these things are things we talk about and have talked about from a long period of time, and that's what's going to lead to a positive resolution of this for us. But the timing of it Tony I... Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: It will happen, but it may go to the wire. Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yeah. And then just the new mining law, while I understand the new mining law is being drafted and I would imagine the export ban is obviously part of that, that's going to be addressed. And would it also be conceivable to see the government has indicated that you got the 2021 expiration of the current CoW that you really wouldn't be able to negotiate that until two years before the end of that initial term. Would this conceivably be part of this new mining law that's being put together at the moment? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, there is actually \u2013 I can identify three principal ways for the government to deal with this. One is changing the mining law, as you point out. That's complicated the present law in 2009 took several years and it was very complicated to get negotiated. The government can deal with these issues also through changing regulations. The existing mining law has the flexibility of extending our contract of allowing exports and so forth without changing the law, but changing regulations, which is in the authority of the administration. There is also a process of where the president can issue executive orders called purviews (55:31). So, the government has alternatives of how to deal with this. It's going to be a challenge to get a new mining law done by early January considering what's happened to date. So we're just prepared to work with the government in whatever approach they decide to use. The challenge of not addressing our contract until 2019 is, one, we are simply unable to invest in the smelter without having our long-term contract assured. I mean that's a huge investment, a significant investment. And we simply just can't do it without knowing that we will continue to operate beyond 2021. We've also agreed to divest an additional 20% which is a significant amount of value. And clearly we could not invest with having uncertainty about our position to operate beyond 2021. So offsetting this and that's a regulation, that's not in the law this two-year deal, is these things that resolution, there'll be pressures to have a resolution with that before 2019. Anthony B. Rizzuto - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks for all the color, Richard. I appreciate it. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thanks, Tony. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): Hi, good morning. I still have a couple of follow-up questions on Grasberg. If the export ban is upheld as it currently stands, can you give us an idea of what percent of the concentrate would be unavailable to go to Gresik next year, i.e. could be impacted? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah. It's a very large amount. I mean Gresik is no more than, could absorb no more than 40%, probably a little less than that. And as a practical matter, with today's copper prices \u2013 I think most of you know that we were surprised when the government put in place an export ban in January 2014, that lasted seven months. We continued the total operation at that time, it ended up costing our company and the government. The government gets a bit more than 50% of the cash flows out of this operation, it cost each of us $1 billion during that timeframe. Well. At today's copper prices, we simply could not continue our operations like we did in that timeframe. We would have to make very significant adjustments to employment and spending and so forth. So, it's just a very important issue for us. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): So, if the export ban stays in place, you'd reduce production pretty quickly? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: We would have no choice. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And in terms of the guidance for CapEx, I assume that 2017 guidance excludes any smelter spending. Is that correct? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: It does not include smelter spending. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then in terms of your long range plans at Grasberg, it sounds like you're suggesting that you'll continue to spend the $1 billion a year, developing the underground even without the CoW extension. Is that the right way to think about it and it's really just the smelter that's, you're holding back on? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah. That's correct. We've gone through several assessments over time, about whether to continue spending or not. We've done it on the basis of assurances that we've received from the government in the MOU and in the October 2015 letter, I mean that gave us assurances, which we've taken into account, as well as the negative aspects of suspending spending. To suspend spending would result in delays of the development that Mark Johnson went over in terms of having the Grasberg Block Cave ready to go onstream when we complete mining the pit, it would involve significant employment reductions and we operate in a very sensitive area in Papua that would have unknown consequences and putting a lot of people out of work. It would require dismantling our team that we have there and the time that would require to put that team back together. So, we've relied on the assurances from the government to keep that spending going. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): And if you decide that there is no resolution on the horizon and you do decide the pull back the spending, where would we see that in terms of the production profile like would it be 2018 or 2019 where we would see the impact? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: No question. I mean if we don't have the Block Cave ready to start ramping up, it would have you just push that ramp up back. You can see the timing required to bring a new mine at Oyu Tolgoi upstream we would have that same ramp up issue that's just fundamental for Block Cave development. We can't start caving until we finish the pit. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thank you very much. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Andrew Quail with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. Just got a couple of quick ones. Mainly on the \u2013 just on net debt. You guys obviously have flagged the $5.2 billion in gross proceeds. I just wanted to make sure I'm reading this right and that sort of includes the preferred dividend and if we take that out more like a $4.6 billion that you guys would expect to receive in Q4? Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yes. We would \u2013 we have a $582 million requirement, a redemption of a preferred at a subsidiary level that would net out of those proceeds. Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And that's obviously included in page 6 when you're talking about your net debt next year at different copper prices? Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Correct. Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Perfect. And then my last one is just obviously you also talked about you're about 25% of your upmarket equity offering, given the price that you guys have disclosed in your average share price. Is that something that we should sort of look forward in the next sort of six months that you guys would be more comfortable transacting? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: It's just a question of one of the reasons that it attracted us to this kind of equity raise is that, we can time when we go in the market and not and so we executed it, we backed off and we expect over the next six months or more to be back in the market when the market is \u2013 when we feel better about doing it it's totally at our discretion. Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And one more, so you guys obviously \u2013 the balance sheet is well on the way to where you want it to be. Does that mean that there's no more asset sales over the next 12 months? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, I think I was clear about that we like our assets that we have in our mining business and we would not expect to have sales there. We have some relatively minor oil and gas assets that we may find ways of doing transactions there, but no we're basically done with asset disposals. Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks very much. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Hi, everybody. Just a quick question on the copper sulfide opportunities. Is \u2013 would this essentially entail if you were to go ahead with these just a modification to the back-end of the plant and then laybacks on your current pits? Is it similar to what you did at Morenci? And then, what copper price do you think you would need to incentivize the development of these sulfide opportunities. And like, for example if your balance sheet were \u2013 if you had no net debt for example, would you even potentially proceed with some of these projects now? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: I think it would be unlikely to do it now... Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: ...because \u2013 I'll answer that, but it's just because we're at $2.10 copper and there's still significant questions near-term about where the global economy is going, where China is going. So, it's not just us. I mean, you're not seeing others doing new projects. Some are completing projects that they started sometime ago, so even if we had all the cash in the world, we wouldn't be pursuing these projects as we speak right now. Now, the development itself varies depending on the ore bodies. Let's take for example El Abra which has \u2013 and we didn't know about this when we acquired Phelps Dodge but subsequent exploration has shown an enormous, sulfide resource there and to-date, that operation has been an SX-EW operation... Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Right. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: ... bauxite, sulfide. So this would be a Cerro Verde type project with a very large mill required. You would have a desalinization plant and the transport of water to more than 10,000 feet. So, it's a big capital project. At Lone Star, we have an existing operation there at Safford, and that would be done in stages of where we would have an oxide development, which would actually be stripping this down to a sulfide project which would require major mill investment. At Bagdad, we have a big sulfide resource, it would require a mill expansion, tailings expansion and investment in water access. So, everyone of these has its own story and there's trade-offs. Lots of advantages in the U.S. today that weren't there historically in terms of energy cost, labor, flexibility. And so it's really a matter of trade-offs, we're doing technical work, so that we'll be in a position of doing it, it would require long-term copper price of $3 or better to have us make these sorts of investments. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Okay, great. So it's a kind thing of where \u2013 we should just think of this as optionality. And when you do \u2013 when the copper price does eventually reach $3, you'll start potentially thinking about deploying the capital to exploit all the vast resources there. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Right. It's going to be an outlook. So we'll aggressively do steps to prepare ourselves because all of these are very long timeframes. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Yeah. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: We're a view of the industry, this is just not us. This is the way the copper industry is and so these delays in spending are going to match up with declining grades, depletion of existing production, and I am not saying this is this year or next year, but a looming shortfall... Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Right. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Is just, unless you see the world really turning upside down economically, it's clear that there is going to be a need for copper that's going to require a significant price increase to justify the spending, and that's why we feel very good about our long-term strategy. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karl Blunden with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Karl Blunden - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to focus just briefly on the balance sheet, you've announced a lot of actions over the last couple of quarters. One thing that a lot of other mining companies have done is issue debt now that the markets are relatively favorable and extend their maturities. Is that something that you consider at all just to get a bit more cash on the balance sheet as you head into a time when in 2018, 2019 and 2020, you have quite a few maturities coming due. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, Karl we've really been focused on taking debt down. Once we achieve our debt level that we're targeting, we'll look to what makes sense in terms of any refinancing, but we've really have been focused on taking absolute debt levels down as opposed to refinancing existing debt, and that's really our priority is to reach these targets, which we're well on the way to. And then we'll look opportunistically as to whether we should take steps to expend out maturities, once we get to the targeted debt levels. Karl Blunden - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That makes sense. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: The cost of our debt has changed significantly over the last six months to nine months too. So, that's been a factor, and we believe as we improve our balance sheet, we could well be able to do what you are suggesting at a lower cost. Karl Blunden - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. And, I think that makes sense. I think one other low cost option just kind of nearer-term is, as you look at to your credit facilities, I saw on page 18 and appreciate the clarity you provided there, that pro forma for the asset sales, it looks like it's your intention to pay down the bank term loan and the revolver as well and keep those paid down. At some point in time, would that be kind of something that you'd consider going to, to get a bit more funding there? Presumably you can do it much more cheaply than in the kind of the open bond markets. And, do you think you could do that without having to provide a security to those lenders? So, in other words, could you get unsecured bank lending to kind of bridge you through this period while you're continuing to repair the balance sheet? Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, the slide that we show repaying the full term loan is really just essentially math, the 50% of the proceeds being applied to the term loan. In terms of whether we could get unsecured bank debt today, I think that's a difficult question to answer. The banks are all under a lot of pressure in the sector about regulations, and I think they would be looking, for a new deal today, looking for security given the company's credit rating. But what we're working to do really is to improve the whole balance sheet and to allow banks and others, as they're looking at the company, to look at it as it is pro forma for all these transactions. And as we continue to de-risk the balance sheet, we think there are going to be additional options available to us to finance the company long-term, and that's what we're focused on. Karl Blunden - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay I appreciate that. Thanks very much. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Matthew Fields with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Matthew Fields - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, everyone. Just wanted to ask a couple, one \u2013 one sort of more question on Grasberg, and then a bigger picture question to finish it out. Given where we were three months ago with the mine plan at Grasberg and where we are today, it seems like there is a lot of a shortfall. And I know that production stoppages for 10 days are sort of unforeseen. But it seems like you would have anticipated that the physical area of the bottom of the pit would be smaller and that the \u2013 it seems like the shortfall in production that you're anticipating is more than just unexpected stuff. So, my question is sort of what happened that you weren't expecting, and is there a chance that that could happen in 2017 as well? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well. I mean the \u2013 our talk about the physical constraints is to explain the consequence of these unexpected things happening. And so, we built all that into the plans that we went into the third quarter with. We absolutely knew that we had limited amounts of area, and we projected, based on our past experience, on equipment availability, and worker \u2013 workforce productivity, what we would achieve. Then we were faced with these issues related principally to the workers, and that had the consequence that it had. So, we took it into account. Yeah, we said we were 15% short of our mine rate. So, that's what it was, and it had a consequence of changing our production profile. Do we have risk going forward? Yes. I mean, going forward, we will need to operate our equipment well. We've had a long history of doing that. We will have to deal with our workforce. We've been doing our utmost do that. But yeah, I mean that's always one of the risks of our business. We have a great history of meeting those risks, but it's particularly significant in terms of near-term cash flows because of the grades and physical situation in the Grasberg pit. But yes, it's a risk. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: The -- normally and historically with Grasberg and other open pits, you'd be mining in multiple sections. So, you'd have a lot more flexibility to make up things. And here it's a very focused area, very high grade area. So even a small amount of downtime on a truck or a shovel can have more impactful variances than what you would have seen historically in another pit or historically at Grasberg. So, but we're very confident that while we could have lifts in the volumes, we're very confident that over this period of time, relatively short period of time, we'll be able to access very significant volumes of both copper and gold. So it's not a question of day-by-day predictions or forecast. It's really looking over this period, and we feel very confident we'll be able to \u2013 we have the plans in place to obtain these volumes. Mark Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Something I'd like to add -- this is Mark Johnson -- is that, even though we've had some production delays or deferrals, a couple of things that we have accomplished is that the high walls of the mine are very robust. We implemented a very comprehensive final pit blasting, final wall blasting process, which is \u2013 will provide us possibly some upside on the feeding (76:18) the pits similar what Richard had shown on one of the slides. That can provide some upside as to the amount of metal we get from the pit. We also put into place a pit de-watering system that essentially we're keeping the pit completely de-watered right now without pumping. And that's kind of unique within the mining industry. It's going to provide some opportunities for us. As we are in the pit bottom to have that water managed in the way that we have is going to provide some upside. So one of the other aspects that we're dealing with is that the workforce is aware of the upcoming transition of the workers from the open pit to the underground. I think it's created a little bit of apprehension within the workforce, that we're working closely with the workers and the union to make sure that everybody understands that they're all going to have an opportunity elsewhere within our mining areas. We've got jobs opening up in the underground with some of the other logistics and levy construction. But that's one aspect too that we're dealing with is we've got about 1,600 people in the pit. We'll need about 600 people beyond the finishing of the pit mining for restoration effort for a number of years. So we're working very closely with the workers to explain what their future looks like within PTFI, but it's another aspect of some of the issues that we've had over the last couple of quarters. Matthew Fields - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So is that maybe some of the disparity between the mine plan from three months ago and this mine plan is that sort of more worker instability in the fourth quarter? Mark Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: We've \u2013 the Grasberg is quite a \u2013 we've been able to demonstrate the mining rates and what we looked at a lot is our sinking rate. How many push backs we mine in a year. I'd say, we've historically been very aggressive on that. We've had push backs where we do over 18 benches a year. We based a lot of our mine plans based on that ability, which takes into account the limited mining space, and we're looking at somewhere to 15 benches to 16 benches as we complete the pit, 15 benches to 16 benches a year. So that's something that we've been able to do before that accounts for space and equipment sequencing. We feel comfortable, we did make some adjustments to our mining rates in the fourth quarter. Our previous forecast had slightly higher mining rates. We're currently projecting that for the remainder of the quarter that we're going to do in the order of 180,000 tons a day. We feel comfortable with that plan. We have some things that we'll manage on a day-to-day basis. We're working closely with our supervisors on communication plans with the workers. So, it's \u2013 there is multi-elements of how we are approaching the productivity issues in the pit. We've also brought some resources from Red's team over there, we've got a group of guys there now that are helping us just look at sequencing and making sure that the pit blasting is going on as scheduled. So, we're throwing a lot of resources at it and we understand the importance of it. We are, like I said, focused on the quality of mining. We want to ensure that everything we're doing doesn't limit our ability to complete the pit in a safe and efficient manner, we are one of the deepest pits in the world, very steep high walls. We've been able to manage that well and we're continuing to focus on that also. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So, let me just summarize this. We have to execute these plans, and that's what we're working to do. We have to execute these plans, if we don't execute these plans, some of the ore gets deferred. It's not a big economic issue, because the ore is there and we'll get it over time. But, we have to execute the plans to meet these numbers. We give you our best outlook on what we're doing, and now we've got to go try to do it. If we don't do it, it just means, we'll mine it over time. So, you said you had one last question, Matthew. Matthew Fields - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. So, sort of you touched on the sulfide expansion opportunities earlier, I'm just wondering longer term after sort of that, the really high gold years at Grasberg and longer term down the road when you give it more economics to Rio Tinto in 2021, what's the sort \u2013 can you maybe rank your sort of best expansion opportunities to get copper back up to 4 billion a year sort of longer term, whether it's the sulfide expansions or some new development project or even some M&A down the road? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, the M&A down the road is just going to depend on circumstances as we go forward and that's always out there. We're not counting on that but we'll be in the marketplace and see what it is. So \u2013 but, really it's the sulfide projects and how we time them, how we go after it. We have \u2013 we talk about 4 billion pounds, 5 billion pounds a year, we've got 100 billion pounds of proved and probable reserves, we've got more than a 100 billion pounds of resources in addition to that, so we've got a huge set of resources to work on to plan. And so we've got opportunities for long-term growth in this business as far as you can see. Matthew Fields - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Richard, I have one last question. Do you have a cameo in the upcoming Matthew McConaughey movie? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, I am interested to see it because I was certainly living it all and we'll just have to wait and see. They haven't signed a release for me, so I don't know, but I will say in listening to Mark, I made my first trip to Grasberg as they were drilling the second drill hole out there in early 1988, and so I've lived through this great ore body and what our team has done over the years and I'm amazed every time I go out there. In the early years, when we'd fall short we always had another place to go mine to make it up. And so we had all, a lot of these same issues but we just had a lot more flexibility. Now that flexibility is gone and that's why we're dealing with these quarter-to-quarter issues that we have. So.... Matthew Fields - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Absolutely. Well, thank you very much for the update. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : Now we will turn the call over to management for any closing remarks. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well. Thanks everybody for your interest and as always if you have follow-up questions, contact David Joint, and we'll get them the answers. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan fourth quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and presentation material for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the conference call by accessing our Web site homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2015 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. On the call today is Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer. Red Conger's here, Mike Hendrix's here, as well as others from our management team. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who'll go through the slide materials located on our Web site. As usual after our prepared remarks we'll open up the call for Q&A. Today FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $292 million, $0.21 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. As detailed in the press release the fourth quarter net income included net charges of 59 million or $0.04 a share reflecting estimated losses on assets held for sale and oil and gas restructuring related charges partly offset by gain on a redeemable non-controlling interest in plains offshore. After adjusting for net charges fourth quarter adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled 351 million or $0.25 per share. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter totaled 1.7 billion. As you'll see in the press release FCX took aggressive actions during 2016 to restore its balance sheet strength and we had an active fourth quarter. We completed $5.2 billion in asset sales during the fourth quarter of 2016 bringing the full year asset sale transactions to 6.6 billion. Importantly, our net debt was reduced by 8.4 billion during the year and currently approximates $12 billion. Our sales for the quarter totaled 1.2 billion pounds of copper, 405,000 ounces of gold and 22 million pounds of molybdenum. And we sold 4.65 billion pounds of copper for the year, 1.1 million ounces of gold and 74 million pounds of molybdenum. During the quarter we completed the Tenke sale in November and our previous guidance had reflected Tenke volumes for the full year. Excluding that variance copper sales were approximately 7% below the October 2016 estimates reflecting lower mining and milling rates at PT Freeport Indonesia. Our fourth quarter realized copper price was $2.47 per pound that was 13% above the year ago, average of 2.18 per pound. Gold prices averaged 1,174 per ounce and were about 10% above the year ago quarter of 1,067 per ounce. Our unit net cash cost for the quarter was a $1.20 per pound, that was lower than the year ago period of a $1.45 per pound, that reflects the higher byproduct credits and also the improved volumes and efficiencies from the Cerro Verde project and higher volume for PTFI. We generated operating cash flows of $1.1 billion in the quarter which exceeded our capital expenditures of roughly 500 million. For the year our operating cash flow totaled 3.7 billion which is in excess of our CapEx for the year of 2.8 billion. As previously reported we completed the at-the-market offering of common stock during the fourth quarter and raised a total of 1.5 billion in gross proceeds through the sale of 116 million shares of FCX common stock. Our consolidated debt totaled 16 billion and cash balance at the end of the year was 4.2 billion, net debt was below $12 billion at year end. We ended the year with no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. At the end of December we had 1.44 billion common shares outstanding. I'll now turn the call over to Richard who will be talking our outlook and updating you on current developments in referring to the slide materials on our Web site. Richard Adkerson : Good morning everyone, as I started thinking about my presentation today I recall a comment that Jack Welch made several years ago and it was, 'don't be giving bows for Act I when the audience is looking for Act II', and I know everyone here is focused on Indonesia. It's the focus of our senior management team as we go into 2017, but having said that I'm very proud of what our team did during this past year. A year ago at this time our share price was well below $4 a share, our credit revolve swaps were 2,700 basis points, we were announcing a plan to reduce that and sell assets. There was a lot of uncertainty about our ability to do that and the values that we would realize. We were completing the construction of our Cerro Verde project and ramping it up and it was a big project, $4.6 billion and big projects in our industry have been challenging in general. We're very pleased that we successfully executed that construction project and ramped up Cerro Verde in a very effective way and today it\u2019s a long-term cash flow generating asset for our company and a core asset. We've had a year of really strong cost and capital management, 19% reduction in consolidated copper unit site production and delivery cost year-to-year, 56% reduction in CapEx year-to-year, 17% below our year ago estimate for CapEx as we manage our capital spending. This call last year in response to a question I indicated a goal of reducing our debt by $5 billion to $10 billion, I didn't really set a time frame on it at that time, but we have reduced our net debt from last year to the end of 2016 by roughly $8 billion. We refocused our business under the direction of our restructured Board of Directors to focus on our mining business and on the copper industry and we were able to come out of this process of selling assets and raising capital with that high-quality copper portfolio that situates our company for creating long term values for our shareholders. Kathleen mentioned our asset sales, they're detailed on Page 4. In the first quarter soon after our year end conference call last year we announced the sale of an incremental interest in Morenci to our long-time partners Sumitomo for $1 billion and in the fourth quarter it was a culmination of a lot of work that went on throughout the year with the closing of the Tenke Fungurume transaction, the resolution of uncertainties of that transaction within the Democratic Republic of Congo, and our partner G\u00e9camines is there. We closed oil and gas transactions to sell the deep-water assets and the California production price is well below what our company paid for them, but at prices that were very reasonable in terms of the current marketplace. Took a lot of work, each one of these transactions was very complicated and beyond that there were a lot of alternative transactions that we put a lot of effort into to give us a set of alternatives before we settled on doing these particular transactions. Page 5 looks at the management of our cost and capital, you can see the 19% decline in our unit cost ending the year with a unit cost net of byproduct credits of a $1.26 for last year, our free cash flows increased, our capital expenditure is decreased as expected, as a result of the completion of the Cerro Verde project but moreover by the in-effect exit from the oil and gas business where we had spent roughly $3 billion of capital in 2015 and over a $1 billion in 2016. Copper market, in the fourth quarter, all of us have been pleasantly surprised by the recovery in copper prices as you know copper lagged behind other commodities. During 2016 it was up roughly 17% for last year, but as we ended the year we improved market sentiments supported by fundamentals in China and the U.S. and the global marketplace and global economic conditions improved. Supply growth continues to be constrained by yearend, we were seeing more impact of supply disruptions which had been uncharacteristically low during the first half of 2016, the price required to develop new supplies is $3 a pound or better the incentive price that Wood Mack points to is $3.30 in real terms. So even at these prices, the industry is still not undertaking new supply development projects. When those projects are undertaken, it takes years to get them to the point of developing supplies, so we're in an inevitable move of reduced supply. The question mark is demand, demand has been better and that points to a bright future for copper today we have relatively low inventory, clearly deficits in the marketplace are in our future, the question is what will the timing and extent of those deficits be and that depends on the global economy and particularly events in China, but we remain -- throughout all this, we remain very optimistic about the outlook for copper and to position our company to take advantage of it. The world's leading copper producers are on Page 7, you can see that we rank in terms of net interest of production behind Codelco, this is excluding Tenke and adjusting our ownership interest in Morenci, if you looked at the operations that we manage, we're roughly equivalent to Codelco taking into account minority interest in the operations that we manage. Our assets include seven copper mines in North America where we supply roughly 40% of the downstream copper to the U.S. economy, two copper mines in South America with the Cerro Verde project in Peru, El Abra with our partner Codelco in Chile, which has a potential for a massive expansion in the future and then of course the Grasberg operations in Papua and Indonesia. You can see in terms of reserves, they're basically equally distributed among those regions, so we got good diversity in terms of copper resources. Our molybdenum only mines are in the U.S. We have byproducts in the U.S. and in South America as well and then our gold sales are associated with the very large gold byproduct in our ore at Grasberg. Cerro Verde commenced operations in September 2015 and achieved operating capacity in the first quarter of 2016. The large-scale long-live reserves net unit cost decline 19% year-on-year, this is a great project and is operating very well and we're very proud of our team for accomplishing it. Our reserves are shown on Page 10. I mentioned earlier when you look at our proved and probable reserves, they are equally distributed by region and beyond that we have substantial mineralized material that we\u2019ve identified in conjunction with our existing mines of substantial amounts, 100 billion pounds of contained copper and then beyond that there is potential that we are qualifying now of very large amounts. What this shows you is that our company is situated with reserves that provide for a very long term future in the copper business. We will have a steady stream of growth projects that will only be initiated when the market indicates a need to for it and we can be very disciplined about where we spend capital looking for attractive rate of return projects and looking for projects with relatively low execution risk, other brownfield expansions. So, our company is well situated. We don't have to make -- enter into the M&A market, but with our balance sheet improving with copper price outlook improving, we\u2019ll be positioned to participate in that marketplace either as buyers or as sellers. Now, we have our large development projects listed on Page 11. They're in alphabetical order, this is not an order that we might pursue them, but it includes six projects with major sulfide opportunities which would be each major expansion opportunities for concentrator projects. Interestingly, five of the six are in the United States and as we look at the relative economics of investing in the United States or outside the United States, in recent years, investments in the United States have become increasingly attractive. The energy situation here with the abundance of energy and the cost of energy, because of the shale oil and gas developments in the United States has provided us low cost of energy. We have a work force in the United States that is much more flexible. We have a none-union work force, we have communities that support our employees, whereas outside the United States, often we have to provide all the community support. So, it\u2019s an interesting situation, what a change over the last 15 years, when this industry was thought to be dead here and now it\u2019s a place for great investment opportunities. Also, El Abra is on this list and it\u2019s got a very large resource that we are doing advanced planning on with our partners looking at potential consolidation of interest in the area and it would be a very large project, but potentially an attractive one and I believer one that ultimately the industry will need to meet the world's needs of copper. So, we've had a great Act I, turning to Act II. At Grasberg from an operations standpoint we have had continuing issues with, I'm going to say an element of our workforce and that is the workers in the Grasberg pit itself. The Grasberg pit has a known depletion point, it's been moved out to now where it will be -- we expect it to be completed in 2018, upon completion we will continue mining the Grasberg ore body as a very large block cave -- is located -- the ore body extends below the limits of the pit. We are currently operating underground in a significant way in our DOZ mine and our deep MLZ mine. We have been operating large scale block cave operations since early 1980s at the Papuan operations of PT Freeport Indonesia and we're very comfortable about technically being able to do that. But as we've approached the completion of the pit, workers have been raising complaints, grievances and have simply not been meeting productivity standards. We're taking steps to respond to that, the effect of this is not a loss of resource, this resource will be realized through mining activities, but what's happening is we're having lower production now which is extending the life of the pit and we're working with the union, with the workers, with our management team to take steps to rectify this and in our outlook, we give you the best estimates that we have going forward. Now I want to spend some time going over matters that many of you are familiar with, some of you may not be, but I think it's appropriate to do it now because the Indonesian government has just issued new regulations for mining operators broadly, and it has implications for us, but it's for the industry as a whole. So, I want to take a few minutes and set the stage for putting this in perspective with what our situation is given our current contract with the Indonesian government. Freeport signed its first contract in 1967 and then after the discovery of the Grasberg, signed a new contract of work in 1991. And this contract provided legal and physical certainty through 2041. And it was on the basis of this contract that Freeport has made a multibillion dollars of investment and we began that on signing of the contract. In the mid-1990s we formed a strategic partnership with Rio Tinto to advance the development of the new Grasberg resource. We had a major mill expansions, we undertook underground mine development and expanded the mine capabilities for output significantly and Rio Tinto remains our partner and we have a great relationship with them. In connection with that original contract we had a commitment to build a smelter in Indonesia, provided that was economic. And we fulfill that commitment. We\u2019ve aggressively went out to find a partner, we found a partner in Mitsubishi, which had new smelter technology at the time and we\u2019ve constructed a smelter in eastern Java at Gresik. And we have an equity interest in it, the majority owner the Japanese and Mitsubishi is operated -- it's operated very effectively and safely over almost 20 years of operations. Been one of the world's best smelters, have not made any money because of the economics of the smelter industry. In 2009, the Government of Indonesia passed a new mining law and implement new regulations over, the law was passed in 2009 and it took time to put regulations in place and really the governing regulations were not completed until 2012. The law provides specifically that existing CoWs remain in effect until they expire. It also instructed the government to seek amendments to the CoW make contracts of work more consistent with the new mining law within one year. We actually, began discussions with the designated senior representatives of government in 2011. And in 2012, the government established an evaluation team early that year to review CoWs. We\u2019ve been in discussions with the government since 2011, 2012, but have never been able to reach a mutually acceptable agreement on reconciling the contract of work with the new mining law. The law says that the contract remains in effect. In early 2014, concentrate exports were halted for more than six months following a troubling January regulation on exports. We didn\u2019t export for more than six months. It cost the government roughly a $1 billion in taxes and royalties, it cost us slightly less than that. But a very substantial amount. In that year, we resolved the ban on exports by entering into an MOU with the government, in July, that covered six main points. Exports, smelter development, divestiture, all of these were subject to negotiation of legal and physical certainty and an extension of our operations from 2021 to 2041. It was contemplated that that MOU would be resulted amendments to the CoW in six months. The government changed in late 2014, the MOU was extended in 2015 and we continued discussions with the government. That led to the government providing our company a letter of assurance regarding extension of the CoW, regarding legal and physical certainty beyond 2021. And it was that assurance, in that letter and in the MOU and in the CoW, the government has, in Freeport have honored this CoW since the first one was signed in the 1960s, and the new one signed in 1991, that has given us the confidence to make the ongoing level of investments that we\u2019ve been making and developing our underground resources. Now just in January of this year the government has introduced new regulations and these new regulations require CoW holders to convert to licenses called IUPK in order to export, and with a license in and of itself there is no assurance of legal and physical certainty and we have been unwilling to give up our CoW to go to strictly a license. And so, what I want to do now is, and this is in our slides and so you can review this and follow up with questions, but I want to point out what our contract of work actually says. It says that we shall have initial term of 30 years from 1991 going to 2021, and that we shall be entitled to apply for two successive 10-year extensions of this term subject to government approval and that government approval cannot unreasonably be withheld or delayed. So, we have the rights to extend the CoW on its existing terms for another 20 years beyond 2021. We made application for this extension and have not yet received approval. With regard to export, there is a specific provision in our contract that says without in any way limiting the Company's basic right to export, that we shall be -- we'll be subject to a reporting -- administrative reporting and non-monetary provisions. With respect to taxes the CoW at specifically that we shall not be subject to any other taxes, duties, levies, contributions, et cetera, except for those expressly provided in this CoW, which provides for an income tax rate of 35% which is higher than the standard rate in Indonesia and provides for royalties. With respect to divestment, there's a specific provision that said, if after signing this agreement the effective laws and regulations of the government's policies impose less burdens on divestiture requirement than those that were in the CoW, those less burdensome requirements apply to our -- to the parties of the CoW. And what happened after CoW was signed in 1991 Indonesia in general adopted new laws and regulations that eliminated requirements for foreign ownership that triggered this provision and we have a letter from the government through its investment board called BKPM in 1997 saying that we have no future divestiture obligations. Then there is general provisions that says the government will take no action inconsistent with the CoW, adversely conductive to the enterprise and including without taking any action or condemnation or nationalization of the enterprise or any parts there under. Later on in this CoW is an act of expropriation and nationalization. So, that's a matter that's strictly covered in the contract. The CoW also said the agreement shall have the full force and effect of law and the law that governance is the law that was in effect at the time of the contract 1991. So, that is what our position is, is that this contract establishes rights and obligations of each party, Freeport and the government and that the government cannot change its obligations by adopting new laws and regulations. And this is part of just the general rule of law, you can\u2019t do that in the United States or other countries around the world. If laws or regulations are changed, then any government has the right to adopt laws and regulations. You can\u2019t avoid obligations under contracts by the government by doing that. And if they do do that, then the government would be responsible for financial losses or damages from the breaches of these contracts. And so, as we enter into discussions with the government, that\u2019s the basis for our position, and the government points to the 2009 mining law, and that\u2019s the element of disagreements that we\u2019ve had. I mentioned this October 7, 2015 assurance letter. And it\u2019s very important because in that letter, which was issued by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, it talks that the government warrants -- now this letter is in Bahasa Indonesia, and warrants is a term that we\u2019ve translated to. I\u2019ve been advised by our people that the law itself could -- you could use the word guarantee or warrants or assures to reflect it. But it says that we would be able to submit proposal of contract extension immediately on implementation of the regulatory amendment and the government will not reasonably withhold or delay it. It is further understood that the approval will ensure, and this is really important, the same rights and the same levels of legal and physical certainty as contained in the Contract of Work. So where are we today? The government issued these new mining regulations on January 12, 2017, which under previous regulations was the date that prohibited exports beyond that date. The regulations that allow our continuation of exports, subject to conditions, including conversion of the CoW to the special operating license called an IUPK. We are working with the government to deal with the reconciliation of these regulations with our contract. And what we\u2019ve agreed to do is convert our contract to an IUPK subject to obtaining an underlying investment stability agreement, similar to what we have in other countries, which provides us this legal assurance of physical terms and other rights. The CoW remains in effect until it\u2019s replaced by a mutually satisfied alternative. And we have requested the government to allow us to export, while we immediately begin to discuss with the government this new license and stability agreement. Our recent discussions, we have not yet been given an export right, our very recent discussions with the ministry indicates that we will be given that right, and we will target dealing with the conversion to the license and the stability agreement within a three-month period. So, we\u2019re committed to start working immediately on that. We\u2019ve been given indications that we will be allowed to export, but I want to note specifically, we have not yet been approved for that. If in fact, we are not allowed to export, the significant impact on our company. Each day, it\u2019s 70 million pounds of copper and 100,000 each month -- 70 million pounds of copper and 100,000 ounces of gold for each month. The nature of copper concentrate is that it's bulk material and we don\u2019t have the ability to inventory this to any great extent. We would be allowed to ship domestically to the smelter at Gresik and we would have to restructure our business to allow us to do that, but it would be a major curtailment of our business. Unlike 2014, at this point where our company is not in a position to maintain the existing operations without being able to export. So, we would have to take steps to curtail operations, curtail costs, that means very large layoffs and the cutbacks in capital spending, and we have developed plans to do that. I will say we don\u2019t expect to have to do that based on very recent discussions with the ministry. But we -- it still remains for us to get these exports approval and we've been given assurances that we will. I just want to close this discussion of Indonesia to make just some very general comments. We are one of the oldest and largest foreign investors in Indonesia. And over the history we have had a very positive relationship with the government and together we've done great things in Papua. This is I would suggest the most technically challenging mine to operate in the world, because of its physical setting and the nature of its ore body and how we have to deal with environmental issues and disposals of tailings and waste material, and the development of underground resources. And we take great pride in what we've accomplished there, and we take pride in the positive relationship we've had with the government and our goal is to remain a positive partner with the government, but while we firmly represent the interest of Freeport's shareholders. We take pride in the benefits that our operations have provided to the government and local communities over our long histories. We produce over $50 billion of economic benefits to the Republic of Indonesia and our future impacts would be even greater. Under our current physical terms, Indonesia receives more in taxes and royalties than any other country would receive if we were to take this mine and put it into U.S., Canada, Chile, Peru. The deal for Indonesia is very fair by international standards. In summary, it is in the best interest of both Freeport and the government to reach a mutually accepted resolution and I believe both sides recognize this and I have confidence that we will reach this resolution that is fair to all parties and we're going to commit all of our time and resources to achieve that goal. We'll answer questions, but I want to just point out our 2017 outlook is for over 4 billion pounds of copper, 2.2 million ounces of gold, 92 million pounds of molybdenum. The copper and gold presumed we will continue to export in Indonesia. Our site production and delivery cost before byproduct credits would be about in the range of $1.50, after credits this is a $1,200 gold and $7 molybdenum would be a $1.06 for the year, this upcoming year, the year we\u2019re in and about $1.15 for the first quarter. At $2.50 copper, we\u2019ll have $4.3 billion of operating cash flow each $0.10 change in copper, plus or minus $2.50, is $385 million. Capital expenditures of $1.8 billion, which $1.1 billion is for major projects. The vast bulk of that is for the underground development in Indonesia and then our sustaining capital is $700 million. Our sales profile for the next three years is shown on Slide 19, net of Tenke and Morenci transactions, we were at 4.17 last year, this year would be 4.1 and roughly 4 in 2018. And you can see our gold increases as we complete the mining of the Grasberg pit [ph] in 2017 and 2018 and our molybdenum sales, which we manage to a certain degree in response to the marketplace, and we\u2019ve done a great job, by the way of processing our molybdenum and our downstream operations to reach a chemical grade where realizations are substantially higher than from metallic molybdenum. Our models for EBITDA and cash flows are shown on Page 20. EBITDA between $2.50 and $3 is $5.5 billion to $7.5 billion. Operating cash flows are roughly $3.5 billion to $5 million between $2.50 and $3, with limited amount of free cash flow. This gives us a clear path for making our debt targets. The sensitivities to price changes for our business is shown on Slide 21 and capital expenditures on Page 22 were without oil and gas now we will significantly reduce capital this year and next and continue to constrain capital until market warrants moving forward with new projects. This balance slide is something that looks great to me. I mean, we went from $20 billion to $12 billion net debt from last year, from year before last to the end of last year. And then if we look forward next year with the range of $2.50 to $3 you can see our debt dropping below $10 billion. And that\u2019s a big positive change for us. And we\u2019re committed to a strong balance sheet now. A strong balance sheet in this industry allows you to be protective of your Company\u2019s shareholder values. It allows you to make investments when their warranted, it allows you to take into account operating risks and risk such as the one we\u2019re facing in Indonesia. We\u2019re much, much, much better prepared to deal with those risks today than we were a year ago. And it\u2019s a major accomplishment for our company to have met the challenges of having a massively overleveraged balance sheet and getting down to where we have a strong balance sheet. I\u2019m really excited about our future. I mean, we\u2019re industry leading copper, and copper in my view is going to be a great commodity to be in. We\u2019ve got a great team of operators and developers. We\u2019ve done all these different projects, spanning the globe, there is not a project in our industry that we could not do effectively. We've got this long-lived geographically diverse attractive cost structure resources, and now we are financially strong to be able to run our business in an effective way. So, Act I. We are working every day on Act II, as we work to keep our business safe and produce volumes and control our cost. So, thank you for your attention and I felt -- I know I've taken some time on the call, we'll answer your questions, but I felt under the circumstances reviewing some background was needed. Kathleen Quirk : Operator, we'll take questions now. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank, please go ahead. Chris Terry : Hi Richard, couple of questions from me, just trying to cut out a few of these more details on Grasberg. Maybe to start on the underground development you're going through with the deep MLZ zone and most of it the Grasberg block cave. At this point has there been any slowdown on that? I'm just looking further out to some of your guidance and comparing it to past periods. I think the 2019 guidance for example has changed a little bit, have you changed anything there or are you still waiting for resolution on the near term before you make any decisions. Richard Adkerson : It\u2019s a good question Chris and there's two factors here. First of all, with the fact that the pit has been extended because of the labor productivity issue that we faced, then that pushes back the ramp-up of the Grasberg block cave. We are proceeding with the development of the block cave and that has gone very well. These labor issues and so forth have not carried over to our underground operations or mill operations. And so, we are on schedule now, we slowed things down a bit to conserve capital and to make this fit in with the startup following the completion of the mining of the pit. With respect to the Grasberg block cave development, we will not get to the point of initiating cave activities until we get the contract issue settled. But that is scheduled to occur in the future in any event, between now and 2018. Because once you start the caving, you got to stay with it or you lose resource. So, we're progressing with the underground development, we're timing it to coincide with the completion of the pit and to a certain extent we're looking at the contract situation before we go forward with it to get to the point of actually beginning caving operations leading in production. The deep MLZ mine development is complete, we have one cave that's in operation with a number of draw points on that cave. We have had an issue related to underground stresses associated with the advancement of the cave. And that has caused us to have to put in more extensive ground support than we had originally contemplated. And that has resulted in a delay in some of the production that we had originally projected for 2017, '18 and '19. So, we\u2019ve had a bit of a slowdown in the development of the mine itself to make sure that we\u2019re comfortable with the safety factors for their underground support, and that\u2019s taking some time and pushing out some production. No lost resources, it does involve some incremental cost, but it\u2019s something that once we identified this and this occurred during the fourth quarter, then we are taking the steps to ensure safety and the ability to produce this thing over the long term. Chris Terry : Okay. Thanks, Richard. And then just in terms of the now, so you\u2019re continuing to produce. So, can you just give us some guidance may be on how much storage capacity you actually have, and then when you have to make decision on that? Is that early fit that you can keep operating until before you\u2019d need to get to losses? Richard Adkerson : Yeah, coming into this January 12th date, we scheduled shipments to take into account the potential for a delay in granting of the export license. So, by mid-January, we had shipped our exports out under our previous license authority and shipments for the upcoming weeks are scheduled for the Gresik smelter. Now Gresik smelter is undergoing a strike and is currently having to deal with that. So, that has an impact. We have a limited amount of storage spaces, as I indicated, and we would need to take steps no later than mid-February, if in fact we're not granted for license. So, it is something that looms in a very short time horizon. Chris Terry : Okay, thanks. And then just the last one for me on the CapEx. Just noticed into 2018 the part that\u2019s not the growth capital, I assume that's the sustaining capital, the 0.9. Is that representative to the business now that you\u2019ve divested most of the oil and gas, or is that still work in progress? Are you under-spending there or can we look at that as more of a steady-state number? Richard Adkerson : Well, we are aggressively constraining spending. And our team was just here last week with all of our mine managers, and necessity is the mother of inventions, but it\u2019s -- we\u2019re sharing inventory, sharing equipment, sharing people and doing every step we can do. This is not going to be sustainable at that level forever, but we're not having to increase it in the near-term horizon. But this is an aggressively constrained level of maintenance capital spending. But it is what -- we can meet our production targets with this level of spending. Chris Terry : Okay. Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS, please go ahead. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Thank you very much and congratulations on the fantastic job on deleveraging last year. That was certainly quite impressive and I don't think it was a small thing at all. At the risk of you know being slightly predictable I also have a question on Grasberg. You've obviously highlighted your willingness to potential convert to an IUPK assuming you get the fiscal and legal certainty attached to a CoW. If you assume for a second that you get this fiscal certainty but the government digs their heels in and says, no, you still have to divest 51% ownership. Would I be right in assuming that you will not commit the vast amount of CapEx to Grasberg if you can't be no have majority control of the mine, is that the right assumption? Richard Adkerson : The government currently owns 9.36%, and that goes back prior to the 1991 CoW. In terms of negotiating with them over the past five years and it was an element in the 2014 MOU, we agreed to divest up to 30%, which was another 20% roughly over the current government's ownership, with the proviso that that divestment be at fair market value. And a year ago, in January we supplied to the government a valuation of PTFI based on valuation parameters of that time, consistent with the negotiations we were having with Morenci and ultimately with China molybdenum on the Tinke sale, which valued PTFI at that time at $16 billion. We have not had any interaction with the government to review that valuation and clearly today copper markets are more positive than they were a year ago. The government has expressed over time an interest in having Indonesian ownership over 51%, but they have indicated they would want to see Freeport continue as operator and to be in control of operation. And so, the thought process as I understand it with the government, is to have Indonesian nationals in some form owning 51%, but not to be in control of the business. Now we believe we have gone a very long way to meeting their aspiration with agreeing to this 30% and at current time we've just noted our opposition to the regulation that requires 51% for all companies, but in our case our contract requires no divestiture. And we have documentation from the government supporting that. There's no question that had we had a requirement to divest 51% from the start of this contract, we would not have invested in the way that we did. While there has been indications that government officials, certain government officials accept the fair market value concept, my point is, you just don\u2019t develop an asset and sell it to somebody else at a fair market value at certain point in time. And so, that remains a matter of disagreement between us and the government. And clearly, if that were a requirement, it would affect negatively our future investments for this business. Andreas Bokkenheuser : That\u2019s very clear. Thank you very much. Richard Adkerson : Let me just say, while I expect that we will get the approval to export and some time to deal with developing this IUPK investment stability agreement, we will still have to deal with this regulation for 51% divestiture and the government\u2019s intention to impose export duties and the level of those duties has not yet been published. So, we have work to do. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Right. I appreciate that. Thank you very much. That was good. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Tony Rizzuto with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Tony Rizzuto : Thanks very much. Hi, Richard and Kathleen. I also want to congratulation on Act I as well. And Richard, when I listen to you detailing the articles in the contract of work in the specific areas, I couldn\u2019t help but think that I was hearing increased frustration as to be expected in your voice. And my goodness, you look at all these -- the details in the articles and how it\u2019s been violated over time and just your response to the last question about this 51% divestment stake and so on and so forth and the question is about operate control and all these types of things. And I clearly heard you say earlier about this kind of very critical date, as you come up upon mid-February, which is not that far away. If these issues in Indonesia persist, would you consider, in addition to reigning in investment there, could we see Freeport look seriously at perhaps restarting some of your [technical difficulty] idled capacity elsewhere in the world? Richard Adkerson : Well, I really think that those are independent decisions. And I don\u2019t think we would start idled capacity just because something was happening in Indonesia. We\u2019re going to look at the idled capacity in investment of developing new resources based on market conditions. And Tony, one of the advantages of having a stronger balance sheet, which a year ago, we were really dealing with the situation in Indonesia and other potential risk in places we operate outside of Indonesia from position of weakness. Now, our canons are loaded, and we can represent our shareholders much more strongly then we could have then, and that\u2019s really important. Tony Rizzuto : Okay. Richard Adkerson : We have the rights to pursue claims against the government in the form of international arbitration. And our legal team advises us that our case is very strong in doing that. We have consistently represented to the government that we don't want to do that, I don't believe that would be advantageous for us, but I also think it would be very negative for the Government of Indonesia. So, we have and as long as we have the opportunity to try to resolve these matters in good faith we'll continue to do it through trying to reach an amicable mutually agreeable situation. But if we get to that point where we can\u2019t and that point would include not being able to export, then we would be left no choice and we're prepared to do that. Tony Rizzuto : Richard just on the labor situation you mentioned, I was unaware that the Gresik smelter was dealing with a strike situation. Your own situation there as it relates to the mining operations, is there a labor contract which expires there this year? It seems like the two year -- I notice every two years. Richard Adkerson : It's every two years and we have to again this summer begin the negotiation of a new CLA agreement with our labor union at Grasberg and that's -- under Indonesian law that's required every two years, as you pointed out. Tony Rizzuto : Is that the expiration on that Richard, is which date? Kathleen Quirk : September. Tony Rizzuto : End of September, and that's to all of the workers at the mine, mill, everything? Richard Adkerson : Well, there is you know -- our total work force, is 30,000 to 34,000 people. Half of those roughly, little less than half are employees, and a majority of employees are members of one union, and that\u2019s the contract we're talking about. The others are contractors and certain of those contract companies have separate unions and separate negotiations, but for the major employee union, that is the contract that we've just been talking about. Tony Rizzuto : Got it. That's very helpful, thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotia Bank, please go ahead. Orest Wowkodaw : Hi, good morning, more questions on Grasberg, specifically your guidance for 2017. Just curious what throughput rate that assumes at Grasberg, because obviously, it\u2019s been tracking kind of below expectations given the productivity rates that you talked about. Kathleen Quirk : Orest, this is Kathleen, the big driver of our metal in 2017 comes from the Grasberg open pit and we are using an estimate -- an average of 140,000 tons a day of mine rate and during the third quarter of 2016 we averaged a 170,000 roughly. We had forecast 160,000 going into the fourth quarter and we had some work stoppages and some productivity issues that we dealt with in the fourth quarter and so we averaged 122,000. The 140,000 that we're estimating for 2017 is very doable, but it is at risk for issues related to productivity and work stoppages, but we think it's very much achievable and potentially we could do better than that. Orest Wowkodaw : And is that -- in your guidance reduction for '17 is that driven purely off of the productivity issues or is there an impact from the ban in the current -- the export ban in the current change? Kathleen Quirk : It\u2019s principally related to the lower mining rates and to the delayed start up or delayed ramp-up at deep MLZ that is affecting 2017. We do have some allowance for the concentrate delays, but we\u2019re expecting under this plan to be exporting in February. Orest Wowkodaw : I see. And just finally on Grasberg, Richard talked earlier about your relationship with Rio Tinto. But can you just please outline, I think to everybody, how the 40% interest is going to work with Rio Tinto starting in 2021 and how that pertains to -- whether that pertains to their stake in PTFI or at the asset level and how we should think about that? Richard Adkerson : Okay. They do not have any stake in PTFI. The operation, even though we call it all Freeport, is actually a joint venture between PTFI and Rio Tinto\u2019s Indonesian subsidiary. And so, they own no shares of PTFI. The numbers we present are proportionately consolidated. So, it excludes Rio Tinto\u2019s interest in current operations, which is very small. But it also, when we report reserves and resources that\u2019s net of Rio Tinto\u2019s interest. And they have an assignment of our CoW, and so it is really a joint venture and they had a varying level of participation from the time it began in -- the production began in the joint venture in 1998 until 2021. Now there's been some extensions of that date for force majeure items. And after that date, they have a 40% interest. Orest Wowkodaw : And if you, like last time you previously talked about selling down 20% to the government, did that -- so would that have included pro-rata share from Rio Tinto or was that strictly Freeport share? Richard Adkerson : That\u2019s strictly Freeport share. We only negotiate with the government with respect to Freeport\u2019s interest. So -- and for example, when I referred to this $16 billion of valuation, that is exclusive of the valuation attributed to Rio Tinto. There\u2019s only one CoW, they have an assigned interest in that CoW, we cannot make any amendments to that CoW that\u2019s adverse to Rio Tinto\u2019s interest. And we\u2019ve been great partners since the start of this operation, and we\u2019re in very close communication with them on all aspects of our business, technical, safety issues, the government relations issues, and so forth. So, it\u2019s that partnership and I want to be clear, we represent PTFI, we have a joint venture partner Rio Tinto that represents their interest. Orest Wowkodaw : I see, and is Rio funding it\u2019s proportionate share than of the underground CapEx and the future smelter? Richard Adkerson : With respect to the CapEx at Grasberg in the underground development. Several years ago, we reached an agreement on how those capital expenditures would be shared. Certain of those costs are deemed to be replacement capital and there are shared on the same basis as operating costs. Some of the costs are considered to be expansion capital and their share 60 :40. Kathleen Quirk : Like the deep MLZ. Richard Adkerson : Like the Deep MLZ project for example. Certain projects that -- for example the access -- there is a common access deep MLZ and to Grasberg and we have an agreed upon sharing. So, the capital that we report, that all these numbers in our presentation we report are report only. They don\u2019t include cost share by Rio Tinto, those costs are relatively small right now, but will grow to 40% once the conversion to the 40% interest comes in play. Orest Wowkodaw : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Quail with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Andrew Quail : Good morning Rich and Kathleen. Thank you very much for the update. Just got a couple of few questions, I don\u2019t want to beat a dead horse, but I'm talking about Grasberg again. Obviously, from that mine rates in Q4, and it probably had something to do with labor as well as mine sequencing. Can you just give us some context about what -- how much does the workforce flex down as you guys transition to the block cave? Richard Adkerson : It's more of a transition than a flex down. Because actually underground mining is labor intensive, and over time as the open pit moves towards completion, the mine rate drops, we're moving much less waste material now than we did in the past. So, there is less equipment, less people and we sought to transition workers from the open pit to the underground through train where we could, we also will have ongoing after the pit is completed, material moving activities associated with the waste management of the waste material that will -- that\u2019s been taken out of the pit and placed around the pit. And we have to manage that for long-term environmental reasons. We have activities in the loans, where we have a tailings disposal area that\u2019s quarantined off with dikes and there is a constant effort on-going to build and maintain those dikes to execute our tailing management plan. So, I would say, Andrew, that is more of a transition than -- what was the word you used --. Andrew Quail : Flex down. Richard Adkerson : Flex down. Andrew Quail : Okay. Second question was about, you guys obviously are talking about a surface water tax. Which was about 470 million. Can you give some color on that and if that was to be paid would that come this year? I realize you guys haven\u2019t made any provisions for it, but what's the background of that, is that the government sort of playing games? Richard Adkerson : This is a clear-cut example of why we have to protect our CoW. Andrew Quail : Yeah. Richard Adkerson : Our contract says we\u2019re only subject to taxes that are specified in the CoW. And what happened here is the provincial government, not the central government, has sought to impose a water tax on us, that we\u2019ve resisted paying because it\u2019s not part of the CoW. And we didn\u2019t pay it, and the provincial governors sued us. It\u2019s gone through the Tax Court now and there was a very recent ruling in the Tax Court that was in favor of the provincial government. And it\u2019s one of these kinds of things that we face in other countries, whereas the amount of the tax I think was on the -- was less than $200 million. But there are penalty provisions in the law that are very aggressive and so that\u2019s where it\u2019s grown-up to the $350 million, $400 million level. We have made -- we have taken steps to appeal this Tax Court decision. We believe it\u2019s wrong. We are considering submitting this matter to arbitration. But that\u2019s what would happen to us if we went to a license without having an investment stability agreement. Under a license, you\u2019re subject to prevailing laws and regulations. And any government can\u2019t come in an impose taxes, fees, import duties, export duties, et cetera, et cetera, water taxes, surface taxes, vehicle taxes. And so, obviously, governments around the world needs funds of these days, and operational like ours is an attractive target, so we had to have some protection against this. We have made very significant voluntary contributions to the Papuan community, beyond what we\u2019re required to pay under the CoW. We began in 1996 to voluntarily contribute, along with Rio Tinto, 1% of our revenues to a Papuan development fund and that\u2019s accumulated, the last that I saw was $650 million, it's one of the largest community development funding activities on the globe. Freeport was just recognized in Forbes by being among the Top 50 civic mining companies, and that\u2019s part of it. The fact that we voluntarily make this contribution each year for Papuan community development. So, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re trying to ignore our neighbors in the province, but we have to resist opening the door to being -- to having taxes imposed on us that\u2019s not part of our contract. There is a real danger of that being a never-ending stream. Andrew Quail : Richard, thanks very much. I've got one more, and it\u2019s not in Indonesia, how about that. Switching to North America, Look, obviously copper prices have rebounded. Is there a some -- is there a price in your head that you guys will start looking now that balance sheet is pretty much fixed? You guys have done a great job there in the last 12 months. Is there -- how much of the capacity do you think is in North America that you guys could sort of may be flexing and maybe bring back on in time? Richard Adkerson : We had an interesting situation with our scale back. operations. We went through and evaluated each project and Red Conger's here and led this effort with Kathleen looking over his shoulder. But we reviewed every operation, every segment of every operation when copper prices dropped so low to see what would be cash flow positive. And we talk about cash flow positive, it includes maintenance capital as well as operating cost and really, we did this in 2008-2009 adjusted some operations and this time when we reviewed them like operations in New Mexico, they withstood that. We shut down production that was really reclamation activities in the Miami-Globe area, the Miami mine, that's not going to come back on, that's done. And we've adjusted it to make it purely a reclamation management effort. At our Serrida mine in Arizona it is a very, very low grade copper deposit, but a significant molybdenum component to it. And because both prices dropped, we started a plan to curtail productions significantly, we're targeting 50% or more. Well as we got into it the team there started finding ways of reducing cost to such an extent that we never cut it back as much as we initially intended. And so now we're just monitoring that. We're not making plans to take steps to invest right now to increase it, it does have future investment opportunities. But we're just managing production to meet cash flow objectives. We did in South America, I know you asked about North America, but we did cut the mining rate in half at El Abra and that remains curtailed. And we're looking at the future development opportunity there, but we don't see stepping that up at the copper prices expected for 2017. Andrew Quail : There's something about [Multiple Speakers]. Kathleen Quirk : We have and I think we've commented on this in previous reports, but we have ongoing work that Red and his team are doing looking at each site to see if we can change pit designs to get more -- to reduce costs and to get more production. That's not an easy exercise, but that's the kind of thing we're looking at. It's things that don\u2019t require significant investments, that maybe we can do on the margin. But we're doing those kinds of things right now which would have a very high return. Andrew Quail : Thanks very much guys, good luck for 2017. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead. Evan Kurtz : So, I just had a question on divestment valuation, I've heard all sorts of different conflicting reports out there and I know at one point you were hoping to get some sort of clarity on whether you could use an IPO on the Indonesia Stock Exchange and it seemed like maybe that wasn't going to work out and today there was a report out that kind of suggested that maybe that could be an option. I've also seen some other reports about the government only having to pay for replacement costs and none-entity [ph] ore and that sort of things. So just wanted to get your views there. Is that something we could see; how likely could you get most of the acquired divestment done through an IPO do you think? Richard Adkerson : Well, Evan we believe an IPO would be an attractive step in achieving divestment plan. Because it results in a market based valuation of the business. And the Indonesian Stock Exchange is growing to be a fair market and I know from discussions with investors there would be people interested in investing in an asset like Grasberg. So, we and others in Indonesia are supportive of that. It would not be a sort of thing that we could do a 20% investment in one step on the exchange, simply will be too large. And so, we think an IPO would be maybe 5% or slightly more than that and we would work with the bankers and all of that would be dependent on market conditions at the time we launched it. So, we think that with respect to these comments about replacement costs, there was some articles earlier this week about somebody saying we wouldn\u2019t get any credit for underground reserves, which was a pretty wild statement. All of those things are just press comments. As I said, we have not been approached by the government to sit down and review our valuation. But with the government officials or financial advisors and we prepared to do that at any time. But we are -- there was a prior regulation that they had, they talked about replacement costs. But our agreements with the government in the MOU and other discussions have always included a requirement on our part that it be at a fair market value and we wouldn\u2019t be prepared to enter into any kind of divestment without achieving that. Evan Kurtz : Thanks for that color. And maybe just one follow up, if I may. Just with respect to Rio Tinto and them taking their 40% stake as you look out past 2021. How is that kind of -- how discussions evolve between you and Rio as far as if you were to pursue a path with the IEPK and maybe one of the -- those paths includes having to divest up to 51% of company in exchange for some of the other protections that you\u2019re looking for. How would Rio Tinto fit into that picture? I mean assuming they take 40%, would that come out of their stake, I know it\u2019s 51% of the assets and not a PTFI that they\u2019re looking for. So how do they fit into the picture and have you had any discussions with them on that front? Richard Adkerson : Well, the way they fit into the picture is, there one CoW, they have an assignment in it and for any changes to that CoW, we basically have to reach an agreement with Rio Tinto on it. And we talk with them constantly, we've had good positive discussions with them, so any decisions we reach would be within. I want to go back and repeat what I said earlier about divestiture. We only can talk about divestiture with respect -- we at Freeport, can only talk about divestiture with respect to PTFI and our interest apart from Rio Tinto, we can\u2019t represent their ownership and that's their business in dealing with the Indonesian government on it. So, the divestiture discussions that we\u2019ve had to-date and the $16 billion number and all the other things strictly relates to PTFI, which is an entity that Rio Tinto has no interest in. They're a joint venture partner just like Sumitomo is our joint venture partner at Morenci and Codelco is our joint venture partner in El Abra. Rio Tinto is our joint venture partner at Grasberg and even though it\u2019s commonly referred to as, the total operations as being PTFI because we manage them, they have certain rights with respect to operations, which we work with them on and reach a meeting of minds on plans and investment and things of that nature too. So, it is a true joint venture. Evan Kurtz : And would they have say in the conversion from a CoW to IUPK? Since most of their rights are with the CoW? So, you have to get their sign off as well? Richard Adkerson : Absolutely. Evan Kurtz : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. I'll hand it over. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of John Tumazos from John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead. John Tumazos : Thank you very much for taking my question. Richard, could you clarify the production rate at Sierrita, is it more like half the capacity, 75% or 100%? Kathleen Quirk : It\u2019s about 75%. Richard Adkerson : It\u2019s about 75%, John. John Tumazos : Could you tell us among the six possible sulfide mill projects which one or two are more likely to go forward first, and whether we\u2019re talking about things that are [technical difficulty]? Richard Adkerson : Okay. I think the first one, John, that we would pursue would be the Lone Star project, which is adjacent to Safford. This is an enormous sulfide resource with an oxide cap and the Safford operation itself is facing the end of its resource life. Although there is a deeper sulfide project there. But what we can do as an initial step at Lone Star is mine the oxide cap using the Safford oxide production facilities and that would serve as a stripping of the material for a long-term sulfide project, which conceivably could include the sulfides at Safford as well as the sulfide at Lone Star, but that would be a major mill investment. So, I think the first thing you\u2019d see us do is move to start mining the Lone Star oxide, which would not require the kind of major capital expenditures that a sulfide concentrator mill would require. Kathleen Quirk : It's essentially a stripping project and would use the infrastructure that is currently in place at Safford. Richard Adkerson : Then beyond that, you start getting into these trade-offs between Bagdad and El Abra, would be I think the two that would be right now competing for that first step. John Tumazos : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead. Chris Mancini : Just a quick question on North America, how would a change in corporate tax rates in the U.S. potentially affect your cash taxes paid out of your North American operations. And then also would a change in Republican administration -- but with a new Republican administration change your decision process regarding any of these potential expansion projects going forward, make it easier or would it make it more likely that you would go ahead with any of them? Richard Adkerson : Hi Chris, that's a very complicated question, it's got really broader implications in Freeport. But let me just talk about a couple of things that applicable to Freeport. You start out by saying, because of losses that were triggered by this oil and gas activities we had, we're not paying cash taxes in the United States, and we have a very large carry forward that would shelter cash taxes for a significant amount of time in the future. And so, one thing we're watching is, in this tax reform are they going to do anything with carry forward. There is just a lot of questions about it, but I don't want to get into this because we could talk forever, and we a conversation at the business round table, but this border adjustment provision that they're talking about could really have interesting implications. Right now, we supply 40% of the copper to the U.S. market and we pay -- it results in taxable income which right now is being sheltered. Under the way this thing is structured as I understand it, if we export that copper we pay no taxes on it. But right now, if we buy a Caterpillar haul truck and we'd use it in Bagdad, Caterpillar would have to pay taxes on that. If we bought a Caterpillar haul truck and use it at El Abra, since it\u2019s exported, Caterpillar has to pay no taxes on it. If we bought all the big -- right Kathleen's telling me to stop. If we were to buy all the big grinding equipment made in Germany, under this cross-border thing if we bought it for Bagdad, we'd get no tax reduction for it. If we bought it for El Abra we could deduct it in determining taxes in Chile. So, we're just one example of it, and so this debate over tax reform and particularly this cross-border situation is really going to be an interesting one to follow. Kathleen Quirk : But the bottom line on a change in the corporate tax rate in the U.S., right now given our situation with NOL is just a simple change in the corporate tax rate, wouldn't impact us. Chris Mancini : Right okay and the border, it's all just so complex that it's tough to really say what the net effect will be. Richard Adkerson : And we're also not one of the companies that\u2019s affected by having cash off shore that has been taxed, you know repatriation issues and unified tax structure cuts, we pay more taxes outside the U.S. than we do in the U.S., the typical case is reverse of that. So, we don't have that issue facing Freeport. Chris Mancini : Okay, okay great and then I mean right and I guess that a new administration -- I mean that in Arizona it's very favorable to mining and expansions of mines and this kind of thing and so the new Republic Administration would necessarily change your minds and I don\u2019t think relative to expansion projects, but I guess it wouldn\u2019t hurt -- there is the potential to stop them going forward, might be a little bit lower or does it really matter? Richard Adkerson : Well, I would say we\u2019ve been here in Arizona for 10 years. 10 years ago we acquired Phelps Dodge and Arizona is an excellent, excellent state for us to operate in. We\u2019ve had Democratic governor when we first moved here, we\u2019ve had two Republican governors now and they through both administrations have been very supportive of our business. We do things the right way for communities and the way we run our mines and so they appreciate that. So, we\u2019ve got tremendous support by the state. The area that we\u2019re watching that could have a big influence on us is EPA regulations. Because we inherited legacy environmental obligations all over this country from historical operations that go back into the 19th Century. And we just entered into a settlement that you may have seen with EPA and the Navajo Indian tribe in the Four Corners area with some significant historical uranium clean-up sites. We were very pleased with that, the government I going to pay significant part of that and we\u2019re going to deal with some of those obligations on behalf of our company. So, these EPA regulations which is a big focus of the new administration is important to us. Chris Mancini : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. David Gagliano : First of all, I\u2019d actually like to start-up by saying, I agree with some of the comments earlier. It\u2019s unreal to me how the Indonesian government is constantly changing agreements and rules over the year. But nevertheless, I guess it is, what it is. So unfortunately, I actually two -- I have two Indonesia follow-ups. Both I think are probably more clarification. But first of all, does the investment stability agreement that Freeport would propose to the Indonesian government, which my understanding is would be the core to converting from the contract of work to this IUPK. Would that investment stability agreement include basically the same six articles that are included in your slide deck, that are included in the contract of work now or if not how with those differ? That\u2019s my first question. Richard Adkerson : Okay. We go back to this October 7th letter, this is a slide deck as well. And in that letter, the government gave us assurances, warranted or guarantee that under the new regulations, we would get the same level of assurances on legal and fiscal matters that we had in the CoW. So, that's the starting point and the endpoint in our view of where we go with that. So, the answer is yes, it would continue all the important provisions related to fiscal and legal certainly that are in the CoW, they would now be in the stability agreement. And our analysis shows that the government has authority under the law through its investment laws to enter into this sort of an agreement. David Gagliano : Okay, great. Thanks for clarify. And then back to the Rio Tinto discussion, just for a second. Another clarification question, I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this the right way. If Freeport was required for whatever reason to divest down to that 49% ownership. After Rio Tinto comes in beginning in 2022, does that essentially mean the net result for Freeport would basically be that the company goes from having the rights to essentially 91% of Grasberg\u2019s volumes today down to about 9% by the beginning of 2022 or am I thinking about that the wrong way? Richard Adkerson : Well, if you would look through it, after what is the net Freeport interest in this, today, as we sit here today, PTFI has let\u2019s just say virtually all the interest through 2021. Rio Tinto has a small piece of that. After 2021, Rio Tinto has 40%, PTFI has 60%. FCX owns 90% of PTFI, so it would be 90% of 60% would be 54%. If we divest --. Kathleen Quirk : Half of our interest [ph]. Richard Adkerson : Well, if we divest, let\u2019s say, 30%. Kathleen Quirk : So, it's still the 20%. Richard Adkerson : Yeah, so if we divest 20% in Indonesian interest, we'd own 30%, FCX would own 70%. So FCX would own 70% of 60% or 42% net interest. If we divest it half, FCX would own 50% of 70%, or 35%. David Gagliano : Okay. All right. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you for that. Kathleen Quirk : And David, I know your speaking questions more from a big picture standpoint, but because of metal strip adjustments, the 60 :40 split will probably be more like a 2023 event. Richard Adkerson : Yeah, because that\u2019s been adjusted for -- for example when we had the almost seven months inability to export. And we\u2019ve had some other interruption in operations over the years that triggered an adjustment to the effective date of Rio Tinto\u2019s 40% interest. David Gagliano : All right. Appreciate. Thank you for clarifying. Richard Adkerson : Okay. Thanks, David. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Lucas Pipes with FBR & Company. Please go ahead. Lucas Pipes : Yes, thank you very much for taking my question and sorry to belabor the point, but it\u2019s about Indonesia. Richard, I think you mentioned that you are prepared to go to arbitration. And I think you also mentioned that it\u2019s a function of whether you obtain the export license. Could you clarify as to what is the timing, let\u2019s say, a month from now, mid-February, you don\u2019t have an export license, would that be the time that you go to arbitration? And then secondly, you also mentioned that arbitration would have negative consequences or there are a number of downsides for Indonesia. Could you tell us what those are? Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Okay. To coin a phrase, I don\u2019t want to draw a red line here. I mean, we are -- if we got to the point of where the government is just arbitrarily saying they\u2019re not going to grant us export license unless we convert to an IUPK without conditions, then we would have no recourse other than going into arbitration. But we believe we -- I want tell you what I believe, I believe we will be granted export, and we\u2019ll have a period of time to negotiate these things. That's what I believe is going to happen. But the point that would trigger it, Lucas, is if the government just said no we're not going to talk with you anymore, we're not going to negotiate, you either have a choice of going to the IUPK and not exporting, then we're not left with any room on it. So that's the key. And then, from the Government of Indonesia's standpoint, you see advertisements here of the government encouraging foreign investment. They had a section in the USA Today, you can their ads in the Charlie Rose most nights. You know they -- the country needs international investments to achieve its economic goals and I've listened very carefully to President Joko Widodo on his trips to the U.S. and at APIC and I feel very positive about his philosophy about investments and so forth. So here Freeport is among the oldest and largest investors in the history of the company -- country, and it's almost history of the company too, but I meant to say country. And so, for us to have to a very public dispute over things like this would be negative for both of us. Lucas Pipes : Okay, thank you, thank you very much for that clarification, I appreciate that, good luck. Richard Adkerson : Thank you very much Lucas, and listen everyone long call, for those of you still on, thank you for your interest and I appreciate that you have a lot of questions about this Act II. You can tell just how focused we are on it. It's good to be in a position of our company, where it is -- it was a priority all during the year, I made five or six trips there year in the midst of all this other stuff. I was just there and we're going to stay with it and work to resolve this problem and then next year I think we're looking at Act III and hopefully that will be looking to invest in all these great resources that we have from a very copper market. So, good luck to all of us and thank you for your interest. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that concludes our call for today, thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect.",

We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2016 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Chief Executive Officer; we also have Red Conger who heads our Americas business and Mark Johnson, who heads our Indonesian business with us today in the room. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then will turn the call over to Richard, who'll go through our slide presentation. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for questions. Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $228 million, or $0.16 per share for the first quarter of 2017. We had a number of special items that are detailed on VI of the press release. They net to an $8 million gain. After adjusting for these net gains, the first quarter 2017 adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $220 million, or $0.15 per share. Our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA, for the first quarter totaled $1.046 billion. We have a reconciliation on the last page of the slide deck, which shows you how we calculate the EBITDA numbers. We sold 809 million pounds of copper during the quarter, 182,000 ounces of gold, and 24 million pounds of molybdenum. Our sales volumes were impacted by regulatory restrictions on PT Freeport Indonesia's concentrate exports, which began in mid-January, and that resulted in the deferral of approximately 190 million pounds of copper and 280,000 ounces of gold. As detailed in our press release, we do have approval to resume exports. We've begun to load ships and that commenced last Friday, on the 21 of April. Our first quarter average realized copper price of $2.67 per pound was over 20% above the year ago period, which averaged $2.18 per pound. Gold prices of $12.29 per ounce approximated the year ago period. Our consolidated average unit net cash cost for the quarter for our copper mines averaged $1.39 per pound of copper. That was essentially similar to last year's net cash cost of $1.38. We had lower sales volumes quarter-on-quarter and that was partly offset by higher by-product credits. We continue to focus on generating free cash flows. During the quarter, we generated operating cash flows of $792 million. Those exceeded our capital expenditures of $344 million in the quarter. At the end of the first quarter, our consolidated debt totaled $15.4 billion and our consolidated cash totaled $4 billion, equating to $11.4 billion of net debt. We ended the quarter with no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. At the end of March, we had 1.45 billion common shares outstanding. I'll now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the slide materials on our website. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. I'll refer you first to slide 3, where we have a picture of the cover of this year's annual report, the title is Driven by Value, which highlights our resolve to deliver value to shareholders. Last year, our annual report was entitled Prove Our Mettle, and in 2016 we did successfully address our excessive debt level going into the year and we're in the homestretch of reaching a target that we set at the beginning of 2016, that was a two year target to cut our debt in half. We have a clear path to doing that now, and our focus is now generating long-term shareholder value. We strengthened our balance sheet and our liquidity. We executed our operating plans. We successfully completed the major development project at Cerro Verde, which was a significant accomplishment for our company and part of this long-term value proposition that we have before us. We refocused our business to be a leader in the global copper industry. We set out with the intent of reducing our debt but leaving ourselves a set of assets that would provide the basis for future profitability and profitable growth. The asset valuations that we were able to achieve in our property sales in a very tough market were attractive. And recent market developments reinforce our optimism about the long-term fundamentals for the copper markets and reinforce our focus on what we're doing. So we are \u2013 going into this year, we're focused on Indonesia. I'll be talking about that. That's clearly a challenge for us, has been for some time, and I want to make sure I address all of your questions about it and let you know what we're doing about facing that challenge. With respect to copper markets, page 5, beginning in second half of 2016, we saw copper prices rebound to higher levels and many in the industry and observers of the industry expected. That reflected improved market fundamentals, driven by Chinese demand, improvement in North America and Europe and supply side issues returned to focus. We'd had a period of time before the current period of where supply side disruptions had been less than the historical experiences and we had several situations involving important mines including our Grasberg mine, but also Escondida, the world's largest copper mine, which faced a lengthy labor strike, and these disruptions are a feature of our business and they will be issues that the industry will face going forward. Underlying that is a real absence now of major new projects for the industry. After the recovery from the 2008, 2009 recession, a number of projects were initiated, most of those have now been completed, and people in the industry, including ourselves, have deferred spending on new projects because of uncertainties in the global marketplace. Adding all of that together, you end up seeing a near-term situations where the market is balanced at best, and over time, without new projects coming on stream, and the falling grades of existing producing mines, a significant require \u2013 for new copper. Wood Mackenzie estimated that 5 million tons of new projects will be required in the near-term future \u2013 medium-term future at least. These new projects require greater than $3 a pound for copper to make them economic. I'll just note that the top 10 producing mines today only produce 5 million tons a year. So that puts parameters around the extent of this shortfall. Projects require 6, 7 to 10 year lead times. The new greenfield projects are particularly scarce, and so we have a looming significant deficit in this business and the question is the timing for that deficit, which will be dependent on events in China and the global marketplace. Now, where we are situated is that our company has significant strengths in facing a market that's going to require new copper. We'll talk about our business in two basic segments now. One is our mining operations and resources in the Americas, in North and South America, and we'll address Indonesia separately. But looking at the Americas, we have a set of mines that have significant current production and long-term growth with long-term established proved and probable reserves and incremental resources of real significance. We have a lot of flexibility in the way we manage our operations and also in the way that we approach future development. All of these mines are operated by our company and that gives us significant synergies in the way we manage the business and develop the resources. The investment opportunities that we see are competitive in looking at the marketplace. We have a flexible and skilled workforce. In the U.S., we have no unions. We have accesses to abundant sources of energy. Again, energy cost in the U.S. have dropped dramatically in recent years with the shale oil and gas development. We can leverage our existing infrastructure. These future development projects will have a relatively low risk associated with them. So we get strong cash flow generators. In the U.S., we have a very large $12 billion approximately NOL to shelter us from future income taxes. And so on this chart on page 6, you can see the very significant reserves that we have available to us and also the significant generation of cash flow that we have from our properties with very low capital requirements because our assets today are fully developed. These opportunities that we have before us are significant sulfide projects that's shown on slide 7. We are doing planning activities. We won't commit capital to these projects until we have clarity on the global economy and direction, but we're preparing ourselves to take steps. They're listed in alphabetical order here. The first project that we will start on is the Lone Star resource that's adjacent to our existing producing Safford mine. We're planning a project to mine an oxide cover over a very significant sulfide resource at Lone Star. That will allow us to extend the production facilities at Safford at the same time we're in effect stripping for the \u2013 to expose the sulfide opportunity which would require significantly more capital. All these are projects that I believe will be required by the industry over time. They're in our inventory, and how we approach them will depend on market conditions. The next major project is likely to be either Bagdad or El Abra. The Bagdad has the benefits of the factors about the U.S. competitives that I mentioned earlier. El Abra has turned out to be a very significant resource, and we are addressing it with our partner CODELCO. And Chino is a opportunity that we're developing and we're getting more information on as very old mine in New Mexico. And Morenci and Sierrita are long-term projects for us. So we have internal development projects for a very long time horizon in the future. Now turning to our important asset in Indonesia, the Grasberg mine in Papua, it's been a difficult year for us. In January, the Government of Indonesia issued new mining regulations that have caused us significant concerns. The impact of these mining regulations would be to require us to give up our contract work in return for our right to export. The government through the 2009 mining law and these new regulations say that you could only export if you have a license, a special license called an IUPK. And the regulations said to get the IUPK, you had to give up the contract. We weren't willing to do that and we advised the government immediately after that gross regulations were issued that we would not be willing to do that, and we entered into a series of discussions trying to find a way to open up a opportunity to have discussions, negotiations with the government to resolve this dispute. By mid-February, we had reached an impasse, and at that point, we began actions to adjust our operations, our capital spending to reflect a business that could only shift domestically. And on February 17, we issued a formal notification under the dispute resolution mechanisms of our contract of a series of actions that the government has taken to breach our Contract of Work. That triggered a 120-day notice period, which extends to mid-June. After June, we as well as the government would have the right to submit this dispute to an arbitration process that's specified by the contract. We continued discussions with the government and by the end of March, the government through its Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry amended certain of the regulations that were issued in January to enable us to retain our COW to return to exports and to receive a temporary IUPK that would provide through October 10 an ability to have negotiations, continued export and leave our COW in place. We, last week, signed a memorandum of understanding confirming all of this and exports are now, we're now loading ships to return to exports and we will immediately begin negotiations with the government and each of us, the government as well as our company, have expressed a commitment to reaching agreement on the long-term solution. Those discussions will involve some very important issues. They will involve our objective of getting assurance of our ability to operate beyond 2021 to 2041 as provided by our contract on terms that provide stability and assurance on legal matters and on fiscal matters. The government wants to talk with us about divestment. Their regulations in January provide for divestment of 51%. Our contract has no divestment obligations. We have communicated that any divestment would have to be at fair market value. We've previously indicated that we would agree to divesting from the current 9.36% up to 30% and so we will have discussions with the government on the divestment percentage, the process, and valuation. In addition, the government regulations require in-country processing of copper concentrates. We developed Indonesia's, with our partners developed Indonesia's only copper smelter in the mid-1990s, the PT Smelting facility at Gresik, a large world-class copper smelter. It currently processes about 40% of our copper concentrate production, the remainder is exported and we will have discussions with the government about developing new smelter facility. So all of these things will be addressed as a package and we will approach this in good faith. I'm convinced the government will too and the objective will be to find a mutual agreement that each others can accept. We call it a win-win objective and that's what we're going into to achieve and that process starts right now. What we did in the first quarter? We began a reduction in our workforce. We have, going into the quarter, roughly 32,000 workers. That includes employees and contractors. That includes people involved in operations, logistic support and capital projects. To-date, we have reduced that workforce for about 10%. We've implemented efficiency programs for cost and capital spending. We slowed investments in the Grasberg underground by about a third. We're spending currently about $40 million a month on the Grasberg Block Cave. And we're prepared to suspend that if we have to. Doing that has some long-term consequences that are negative for all of the stakeholders, because it would delay \u2013 the resource remains there, but it would delay the ramp-up period. And that involves cost and economic consequences for everybody. It would affect the workers, because if we totally suspend that, we've got about 5,000 workers that would be out of work. It affects the local Papuan communities, because in the Mimika Regency, we represent over 90% of the GNP. It affects a large number of Indonesian suppliers, not only in Papua, but throughout the country. The government has lost almost $500 million in taxes and royalties for the three months or so that the exports were suspended during the first quarter of 2017. And, of course, it affects Freeport and our partner, Rio Tinto. With all this going on, though, because of our efforts to constrain spending and capital spending, we generated positive cash flow at PT-FI during the first quarter. So, we have an ability to do that going forward, even if we're suspended from exporting, but it's in all of our interest to get this long-term solution. And as I said, we're approaching it with an objective and with confidence that that will be achieved, but it will be complicated discussions that start right now. Looking at the Grasberg Block Cave, this is a remarkable opportunity for us. The Grasberg district has been one of the mining industry's great mining discoveries, operations, development in the history of mining. But just focusing on the extension of the resource that we've been mining and are mining from the open pit to its extension at depths where we mine in this massive block-cave operations, it is a tremendous resource. It's got 964 million tons of over 1% copper and with 0.78 grams per ton of gold. The reserves themselves and the copper metal that we produce, for example, are about 50% larger than out of Morenci and then in addition, you have this enormous gold component. To date, we've spent about $3 billion on the development of the Grasberg Block Cave and the common infrastructure to allow its production. We're just over halfway through the initial development for that resource. This transformation is a state-of-the-art underground development and it's a source of pride not only for our company, but for our workforce and for the country of Indonesia. High-grade, low life, low cost and it's an important part of our future and we are working to find a way to make it, so that all of us benefit from it, including the government. Under our contract, the government of Indonesia has a very attractive current proposition for participating in the operations. Our company just celebrated the 50th year of its doing business in Indonesia. Since 1992, when we signed \u2013 after signing this current contract, we've contributed $60 billion to the national GNP (sic) [GDP] (24:51). By far the largest private employer in Papua and one of the largest taxpayers in all of Indonesia. We've contributed voluntarily, this is not an obligation, but 1% of our revenues to the local community through our Freeport Partnership Fund for Community Development. Over the past 11 years, that's generally almost $700 million of voluntary contributions to the local community. If we look at the contract, the government receives a majority of the cash benefits from the operations, more than any other government in the world receives from mining operations. Over the last 10 years, the government has got 62% of the direct financial benefits of this business and that doesn't include the multiplier indirect effects on the Indonesian economy. And when we look at the existing contract, future taxes and royalties and dividends through 2041, the term of our contract, are expected to exceed $40 billion. So, this is a big asset not only for our company, but for the government and particularly important for the province of Papua. So, turning to our outlook, we've adjusted our 2017 projections. We've had to take into account the suspension of exports in Indonesia, it's had an impact. In Peru at Cerro Verde, we've had to face an incredible weather situation. This is one of the driest places in the world and they've had three, four, five times annual rainfall and it's caused a lot of damage, injuries, deaths, and damage to the infrastructure throughout the country and we had a strike, which did not have a material impact on first quarter production, but it affected our mining rate and will have an impact on productions for the year. So, we've dropped our outlook for 2017 from 4.1 billion to 3.9 billion pounds. The gold reflects the situation in Indonesia at 1.9 million ounces. Molybdenum at 93 million pounds is roughly what we've guided towards previously. Our expected site production and delivery cost at $155 is up slightly. Our after by-product net unit cost at $1.08, it was previously $1.06. Provided we're able to operate throughout the year in a normal fashion in Indonesia at $2.50 copper, we are looking at $4 billion of operating cash flows for the year, each $0.10 would be a delta of $275 million. Our capital expenditures have been reduced from $1.8 billion to $1.6 billion. And this is $700 million on sustaining capital in the Americas and some in Indonesia, but $900 million on the major projects, including $700 million in Indonesia, which is down $200 million from our previous guidance. You can see our outlook on slide 13 for 2016, 2017 and 2018, as well as our gold and molybdenum outlook. And on slide 14, we show our EBITDA as an average of 2017 and 2018. At copper prices ranging from $2.50 to $3, EBITDA goes during that period from $5.6 billion to $7.4 billion over that price range, and operating cash flows would vary from $3.4 billion to $4.7 billion, from $2.50 to $3. Our sensitivities for copper, molybdenum and gold and currencies is shown on page 15 to help you with your modeling. Capital expenditures on page 16 show that what we incurred in 2016, which included $1.2 billion of oil and gas and then looking forward, spending that would be incurred with continued Grasberg underground development and continuation of the current positive market conditions that we have. The big issue in this is assessing the Grasberg blockade, and it is totally dependent on our progress we make in our discussions with Indonesia. And if we are successful, as we are working to achieve, then we would continue that project, because it's important to all the stakeholders. If not, we have prepared contingency plans to defer that project and that would have a significant impact on capital spending and employment, and also future revenues. Page 17 shows the progress we made with our balance sheet that I've referred to in my initial comments. The net debt going into 2016 was over $20 billion, going into 2017 it was down to $12 billion, and as we look forward to the end of the year, you can see it drops below $10 billion depending on prices. Our objective is to achieve further debt reduction to get our balance sheet to a position that as market conditions improve in the future, we can then look at resources to invest in growth projects at that time depending on market conditions, and we look forward to the time with this set of assets to be able to return to the Freeport tradition of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and potentially stock buybacks. Our near-term debt situation is very manageable. You can see we reduced gross debt by $500 million during the year. We have over $4 billion of cash and our maturity schedule is attractive and we have access to capital. So, we're continuing to look to opportunities to improve our long-term liquidity situation by managing our debt schedules. So, we are very pleased with the progress. We've got a lot of work to do and we're going to prove our mettle again this year by addressing the issues that we have. We went through all this that we've experienced over the last three years. We've maintained an industry-leader copper position, couldn't be more prouder of our team for the way they operate and develop the business. As I've said many times, we can do any copper project anywhere in the world. And we've got this long-lived, geographically diverse portfolio of assets, and we're financially stronger today after what we did last year and we're going to be focused on maintaining financial strength and flexibility as we go forward. So, with that, Regina, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. One moment please for our first question. The first question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, Richard and Kathleen. A couple of questions from my side. Just in terms of the guidance for this year, is it right to assume that in 2Q you basically would sell most of the concentrate that was sitting at port plus what you produced in the quarter? Is that fair for 2Q? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, there is a \u2013 in general, that's true. There is a ramp-up that we have to go through. And we also have to coordinate shipments with our customers who had to make other arrangements for supply when we were shut down from exports. But we do have a series of ships, ones having loading completed as we speak, to \u2013 we had close to 100,000 tons of copper concentrate at our port site and storage facilities. These ships are 20,000 tons, 25,000 tons. And so we'll have a series of ships to reduce that inventory. We're beginning to ramp up. We have plans to ramp up our mine rate and to return our mill to full production. Now, there is labor issues that we are facing in Indonesia at job site. The leader of the union that represents PT-FI's employees, which is about 12,000 of our 30-plus thousand workforce, our employees, is undergoing a trial for corruption allegations in Timika and there have been demonstrations by workers in support of their leaders. There was an incident with the police in which some rubber bullets were fired and some people were injured in the last three days. That has resulted in absenteeism at our workplace. And then overlying that are concerns by the union of our plans to \u2013 that we put in place to reduce employment, and they're concerned as we are about the long-term impact of that. And so we are engaged with the union in an effort to get them to return to work and we're getting support from the government and from the local police. During all this quarter, the social situation and security situation at job site, which was a concern when we suspend operations, has been relatively peaceful, but we do have this current unusual situation with the demonstrations and the absenteeism. All of our projections are predicated on getting that resolved and getting people back to work. Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Richard. And just in terms of the longer-term profile, it looks like roughly you've delayed some of 2017 into 2018. But then looking at further out, the 2021, 2022 numbers look a little different, particularly 2021. Is that just assumptions around where the underground is at or what's moved those sort of medium to longer-term numbers? Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: It's really a slowdown of the Grasberg Block Cave compared to our prior assumption. And these are, at this point, assumptions and assume that we continue to slow Grasberg Block Cave throughout 2017. As Richard talked about earlier, the timing of that will depend on the progress we make with the government with respect to our long-term agreement. So what we've assumed here is a slight delay in the development of the Grasberg Block Cave. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So Chris, our long-term plan for several years had been to complete mining the pit in 2016, in early 2016. And now with the issues we faced over the last five years, in terms of the issues with the government and the strikes and so forth, that has been pushed out to 2018. The ramp-up of the Grasberg Block Cave is a six-year plus event. So the more this thing is delayed, the longer that ramp-up occurs, and that's what I was saying, it's so important that we reach an agreement with the government so that we can move forward, complete mining the resources and the pit. We haven't lost any resources throughout all of these deferrals. But it's an \u2013 economically, the sooner we can begin completing the Grasberg Block Cave development, begin ramping it up, the better off we all are. Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That makes sense. And just a last one on the CapEx, just to be clear. The latest number that I had seen for the smelter if you were to go down that route is $2.5 billion. Is that correct? And also in your guidance, there is no CapEx included in future years for that at this stage until you get resolution on the ownership agreement, is that right? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: That's correct. No CapEx are included. Our plans are to finance this on a project basis. There would be other partners involved in our plans, and we would get project type financing for it, which requires that we have a contract for PT-FI's operations, because that's the source of the plot for the smelter. $2.5 billion, there is working capital requirements and so forth, so it would be somewhere between $2.5 billion and $3 billion, depending on that. We've done a lot of preliminary engineering work with the Japanese construction firm that designed our initial smelter. We've done site studies and site analysis, but we have not entered into contracts on the timing of spending new capital and that's dependent on reaching this long-term agreement with the government. And the government has agreed on the MoU that we signed in 2014, has recognized that there would have to be certain financial incentives provided by the government because of the poor economics of this investment. Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Richard and Kathleen. I'll leave it there. Thanks. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Richard, just curious on your statement earlier. What gives you any confidence that the Indonesians are, I guess, willing to negotiate beyond the initial terms that were set out under the new mining laws around Grasberg? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: My direct discussions with senior government officials. I mean, I have been in continual conversation with people and they've made public decision out. The Indonesia is a country that has a democracy, it has freedom of press, and for those of you who read the media in Indonesia, you know that there are a lot of comments made by many different people. Some informed, some less so, but in terms of my direct discussions with the government officials, we have committed with them to approach this in a good fair basis to reach a resolution. And in fact, we are beginning those discussions immediately and I'll be spending a good bit of time in Jakarta in those engagements. There was a visit to Jakarta last week by Vice President, Michael Pence on his tour of countries in Asia. He met with the President and spoke with him about our situation and it was a positive conversation according to the reports that I've received. We have had tremendous support from others in the U.S. government in the State Department, the Commerce Department and in business groups that deal with Indonesia, U.S. bilateral relationships. So, it's in everyone's interest at the end of the day. It's been a complicated situation politically in Indonesia, but that's the basis for my comments. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: And does that mean you are holding off pursuing the international arbitration to protect the COW? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, having said all that, we're not underestimating the challenges, because these are issues where we have significant disagreements on. Now, we have triggered the 120-day notice required by the contract and that notice period continues to run. And so after mid-June, we and the government would each have the ability to commence arbitration proceedings. We hope not to do that. And \u2013 but we have that, as a right of ours under the contract, that process requires a significant amount of time, procedurally to put in place. So that is, let me see, some of this running in parallel, it's a fallback that each of us will assess after mid-June to see where we are in the discussions, and whether or not to proceed with arbitration is my hope that we do not have to take that step, but if we have to, we'll be prepared to do it. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: I see. And in your disclosure, you talked about potential significant reduction in capital spending development at Grasberg if there's no resolution. Would we see that impact as early as 2018 or is that something that, really that... Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: You potentially could see in 2017. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Okay. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: I mean, it's a step, the next major step we would have would be to suspend the Grasberg Block Cave spending, which we're spending roughly $40 million a month on, and that involves a set of workers, principally contractors of about 5,000 people. So, we are continuing that. We had plans to suspend it. Those plans were averted by this recent agreement that we reached with the government for this temporary IUPK and so all of that is \u2013 we still have those plans ready to execute if we have to. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Orest, we've taken the number down by about 25% for the Grasberg Block Cave and the number Richard is talking about, $40 million, is the reduced number. We have the ability to take that down to zero. Economically, we prefer not to because of what it does to our production schedule and NPVs, but in terms of how we are progressing with the government, we are assessing that on a week by week, month by month basis and have plans, as Richard said, contingency plans if we need to take that number all the way to zero. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: I see. Just final question if I may. What percent of the 2018, 2019 copper production can be attributed to the Block Cave here? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Very little in that timeframe. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: So it's really later in 2021, 2022? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: That's right. And as I said, let's say, roughly six-year plus ramp-up. So, we are about just over half way through the initial development. We'd be mining the open pit into 2018. We can't start that ramp-up until mining in the pit is completed because it's directly underneath the pit and you have subsidence, so we have to complete the pit and then begin the ramp-up of production and that goes out for six-plus years from whenever we start. So it's not much impact on production during that timeframe you referenced. There is the capital that would be spent, which we'll have to adjust that capital if we have to live within lower cash flows, but not being able to export. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi. Thanks. I just have a question that actually continue along the same lines in terms of the longer-term mine plan at PT-FI. I'm looking at the slide on page, I think, it's 26. 2022, it shows no change versus 2021, obviously, down a little bit \u2013 well, anyway 2020, 2021 down versus previous. But my question is 2022, does that include, I don't think it does, Rio Tinto's interest? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: No. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: This is all net to PT-FI. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: No, this is all net to PT-FI, and let me just \u2013 I think everybody understands this. While we operate broadly with Indonesia under the name PT-FI, the operation is a joint venture between Freeport subsidiary PT-FI and a Rio Tinto subsidiary in Indonesia, and all the numbers that we show financially in our presentation are Freeport's subsidiary numbers, and currently that subsidiary is owned 9.36% by the government with the remainder owned by FCX. So all of that just reflects PT-FI's net interest. Last year in January, when we filed the valuation of PT-FI with the government that showed a $16 billion valuation at that time. That was strictly PT-FI Freeport's net interest and excluded any values for the Rio Tinto or the values for Rio Tinto's interest in the joint venture. David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. So, but \u2013 I guess, I don't know why I'm still confused on this. But, if you go to 2023, 2024 et cetera, the PT-FI mine plan doesn't change, but Freeport's ownership of PT-FI changes, correct? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: That's correct. Right now that was originally and this was an agreement that was signed in 1995. And it was structured around that all reserves at 12/31/94 will be retained by Freeport PT-FI and they were scheduled to be produced by 2021, and Rio Tinto was scheduled to come in for 40% beyond 2021. Well, because of the delays and strikes and export suspensions, that 2021 date now goes out to roughly 2023. David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So Rio Tinto's 40% kicks in... Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: 2023. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: In 2023, sometime during the year 2023 and, of course, that's going to be dependent on our resolving all these issues. David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Right. Okay. And I guess the reason I'm asking is, because, I guess, I'm still trying to figure out, the economics, can you give us a little more color on the economics associated with continuing the spend, to go underground, continuing to spend and develop obviously the Grasberg Block Cave when \u2013 by the time it actually really ramps up, the ownership really switches over to Rio Tinto. Is there any \u2013 like what's the economics associated with the upfront CapEx? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: I mean, they are very attractive. David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Even with the reduced... Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: The rate of return, and when you say it shifts over, I mean we still own 60% of this business and I mentioned just how large the resource is. So I haven't seen every economic analysis for future development in our industry, but my sense is this is perhaps \u2013 this is probably the most attractive rate of return investment in the mining industry today. David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Understood, I appreciate it. Thanks. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And, Dave, I understand all this has been a moving target and change and what we would plan to do as we \u2013 when we complete our long-term agreement with the government is have a face-to-face session with analysts and investors and walk through this in some detail so that we make sure that there is a clear understanding of the value of this business. And we haven't done that to date, because we've been so focused on trying to resolve the issue with the government and all of these values are dependent on getting that resolved. David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thanks for your questions, Dave. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli. Please go ahead. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Hi. Just a quick question along those lines of the premium with Rio Tinto. Under the current contract, how much would they have to spend on this underground capital development in Grasberg in order to maintain their 40% stake, and have they committed to that, because I've read in the press that they were questioning their commitment to Grasberg at this point? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So, Chris, the way this works is, capital expenditures are divided on the basis of whether they're replacement capital or expansion capital. The Grasberg Block Cave is deemed to be replacement capital. And so Rio Tinto share of those costs are relatively small. They pay the same percentage of that, that they would pay as determined by their share of revenues and how much operating costs they pay, and that has been relatively small to date. The Deep MLZ project is a growth project, and they pay 40% of that. And we years ago entered into an agreement that the common infrastructure that's used to develop both of those resources, and ultimately the Kucing Liar resource is shared 50 :50. So they are making some capital commitments, and they've made those consistently all along. The bulk of the capital is funded by Freeport under the current situation. And I will say, we have an excellent working relationship with Rio Tinto, and have had from the start. They're engaged in what we do. We're transparent about everything, they have the input. There is one contract that's shared by Freeport and Rio Tinto and they have the right to approve any changes to that contract that has an adverse impact on their company, so it's important that we are aligned and to date we are aligned. We're all concerned \u2013 we are both concerned about the future and recognize the importance, particularly important for Rio Tinto because without getting this extension, they actually have no value to speak of in the business. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay. So, over the next \u2013 sorry. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Chris, I was just going to add that we manage the development of these ore bodies based on the aggregate 100% economics. We do what's best for the overall operation and don't get into trying to say, you're only funding a small part of this and getting 40% or you are funding 40% and only getting a small part. We manage for the overall NPV the aggregate resource and that's worked out over time. It's been pluses and minuses on each side, but it's worked out to be a good long-term partnership. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And the agreement has a kind of do-right provision and over the years each of us have approached it in that standpoint. It's a complicated agreement. Doesn't spend any time, and wish you've done it different way back in the mid-1990s, but we are where we are and they are very good partners. And we feel a very strong responsibility to represent their interest in the right way and we'll do that. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Great. Of the $1 billion that you expect to spend on underground development over the next few years, how much of that per year do you think would be Rio Tinto? I understand it depends on if you are in, I guess, the DMLZ, but do you have a sense as to how much they have to spend? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: It'll vary somewhat, but it's roughly $200 million a year. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Got it. Okay, okay. And, okay. And then going to Safford, so it looks like you have around a year left in your reserve life at Safford now under the current reserves and so this Lone Star would essentially extend the life of the Safford mine you said. So would it be able to produce at similar rates around 200 million pounds of copper a year? And I mean, I guess, the question is, what kind of IRR are you expecting from the project, and kind of what can we infer then in terms of what your required IRR would be for future expansion projects or things like that you described earlier? Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Red can add to this, but the Safford production goes out to 2021. It declines from here to there, but what we're doing really is essentially bringing in ore from the adjacent Lone Star mine and using the same infrastructure, tank house that we have at Safford. Most of the cost is stripping and so it's an attractive project from the perspective of low capital intensity, but we do have a several-year stripping program that's several hundred million dollars. I don't know, Red, if you want to add anything.. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Red Conger runs our operations in the Americas. Red? Harry M. \u201cRed\u201d Conger IV - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah, Chris, so we're producing about 60 million pounds a year there right now, and as Kathleen said, that will go out for another eight years. And that gives us plenty of time to get the stripping done and maintain the continuity of the operation. So it's attractive and we're just \u2013 we should have permits here mid-year that would allow us to start developing and getting some of the early mining done. So we're on it. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And that project, to your question about IRR, that project in and of itself is a good project from an IRR standpoint, but what we're really doing here is exposing the longer-term resource at Lone Star which is an enormous resource. And so this \u2013 while this will produce cash flows and a return on investment, it opens up a very long-term 50 billion pound sulfide resource that we can consider for future investment. So it's part of a long-term district play. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay. I mean, would we expect \u2013 or could we expect to see feasibility studies on any of the development project that you mentioned, Bagdad, Chino, El Abra, so that we could get some parameters around what the economics would be depending on the metals prices and things like that as you do complete these studies? Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yes. I mean, what we're doing now is going through the portfolio. We've got a preliminary feasibility study on El Abra, and that's going to be updated, but the rest of the portfolio in the Americas, we're going through it to identify what the project \u2013 defining the project. And what we're challenging our team to do is to find ways to cut capital. We've been focused on keeping operating costs low in the Americas, but what we're challenging the team to do now is how do we develop cheaper mills and how can we get these projects to be more economic because many of the projects require, just like the rest of the industry, $3 copper for them to make sense. That's not the case with Lone Star oxides, but some of the larger projects, because of the high capital costs of a mill, require higher copper prices. And so what we're doing first before we go prepare feasibility is to challenge our team to find ways to be more creative about how we can develop projects on a lower capital cost basis. And so, these are long-term, Chris, in our portfolio. We're not spending much money now, but we're preparing for the future long term. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And I don't want to drag this out too long, but that's been a strength of our business. I mean, we go back years \u2013 through the years as Phelps Dodge was the leader in SX/EW, but it was also active in developing mills over time, at Candelaria for example. And PT-FI was a real leader in developing large-scale SAG mills and then high-pressure grinding rolls. And we've taken that experience and brought it forward to the expansion project that we had in Morenci where we had a new mill design, the recent expansion at Cerro Verde with new mill technology. And now we want to keep building on that and working with our suppliers and contractors, as Kathleen said, to have these opportunities with much improved economics and energy efficiency and so forth. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Great. Thanks. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Okay. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead. Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. My first question is just coming back to Indonesia. Is your sense at the moment that you're negotiating against a single party there or there's still a lot of divergent viewpoints on the table on the Indonesia side? Thanks. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, I'd say yes to both questions. The Minister of Energy and Mines is taking the lead and has been authorized by the President to represent the government. So, he is the point person in these negotiations, and he's a guy with a good business background and we can talk with each other in a very straightforward, candid way. The Minister of Finance is also involved in a significant way. But there's \u2013 in a country like Indonesia, there are divergent views and so our challenge will be to find a way to reach an agreement that is acceptable to the Minister and to the President and works for us. Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just a follow-up question. You mentioned that you've entered into an MoU recently in Indonesia. Does that MoU last for \u2013 I guess, is there a tenure on that MoU... Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yes. Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: ...or is it indefinite? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: No, it's six months. I mean, this temporary IUPK lasts until October and so we need to get a long-term resolution during that timeframe. Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then at the end of that period, would your contract award still be valid? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yes. Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's clear. Thank you. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yes, and the MoU makes that clear. The issue is, we would then fall back with their regulations, which would restrict our rights to export, but the timeframe \u2013 and this was a \u2013 we had suggested this back in January \u2013 was to give us a period of time to negotiate a long-term solution and during that period allow us to export and allow our contract \u2013 recognize that our contract stays in place, and that's what the MoU does, and this MoU will be filed publicly. Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Sorry, just one final question, if I may. Are you \u2013 I think you answered this earlier, but just to clarify, are you still allowed to move to arbitration according to the terms of the MoU, does it restrict your (01:05:47) rights (01:05:48)? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: The MoU doesn't address arbitration, but the notice period has been initiated and that will run through the end of June. And under the terms of the contract which remains in place, either party has the right to move to arbitration after mid-June. Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for the clarification. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Quail with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, Richard, Kathleen. Thanks for the update. More short-term questions on Indonesia on our models. What do you foresee going back to on a 1,000 tons per day basis the operation in the next sort of \u2013 in 2Q and maybe 3Q given the dip this quarter? Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Are you talking about mill rate? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Mill rate or... Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, yeah, mill rate, mill rate. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Mill rate. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Hi, Mark. Mark Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah. This is Mark Johnson. Our forecast right now, pending the issues with our workforce, is that we'd be up near 200,000 tons a day again. We'd be producing upwards to 10,000 tons a day of copper (01:07:05) but averaging somewhere around 7,500 tons for the quarter. Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And then \u2013 and 200,00 in 2Q or is that more throughout 3Q, 4Q? Mark Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: It's really the 2Q and then for the reminder of the year, we'll be at that sort of rate. Just really depending on the hardness of the material, coming out of the mines, but it'd be more or less normal operations as we've seen in the past. The mill has performed over 300,000 tons a day at a peak and it's typically kind of that 200,000 to 220,000 based on material types. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah. And we manage our business on the basis of metal output as opposed to mill rates. I mean, and the mill rates will vary, as Mark says, depending on the nature of the rock and we are in really high-grade material now, so we need to. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: But we'll average less than 200,000 in the second quarter. Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Because we're just ramping up now, but with Mark's \u2013 we get to by the end of the second quarter, the 200,000. Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: You get to that rate, Kathleen, yeah. Okay. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Right. Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So, yeah, you would be \u2013 because you start on the 21st of April. Okay. And then, well, you had pretty good recoveries last quarter in both copper and gold. Do you expect that still to continue going forward? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And that again is the quality of the ore... Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: The grade. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: ...we had over 92% on copper. Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And that's very much driven by the high-grade portion of the Grasberg, which we'll be mining consistently to the end of the pit. Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. So, it's through to 2018. Okay. It's a positive, good. Okay. And then, I mean, it's a bit of a weird one, Richard, but you might laugh at this one, but just for modeling. Your price realized for molybdenum of $8.70 was much higher than we expected. Is there something we're missing there when you look at spot prices on screen (01:09:02)? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: What you have to take into account is that we sell a significant portion of our molybdenum output in a chemical form as opposed to looking the quoted price is for molybdenum metal and the chemical product is a much higher valued product. This is \u2013 we're able to do this as a result of investments that were made over many years. And then we enter into supply contracts to refiners and others who use this chemical-grade molybdenum and its realizations are significantly higher than metallic molybdenum. Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Thanks very much guys for taking my question. Bye. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Michael, you may be on mute. Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you very much. Thank you, Kathleen and Richard. I'll try to keep it brief. Regarding \u2013 if you decide to suspend block-cave investment, can you reverse that in two weeks, or it's like once you get going with that, is that going to be a multi-week, multi-month process? I mean could you just get a sense of when you talk about that, I know it's a very serious decision, but how that would play out? And if you had to change it, how quickly you could get it back into gear? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah. It's a really good point and that's what has led us to be reluctant to turn it off, because this is a highly skilled group of workers that are involved in this block-cave development. And if we demobilize that group, then we would be faced with a period of time to remobilize them and get them back to work. And it's not a matter of weeks, but it's a significant operational issue for us to disperse that team and there are other major block-cave operations going on around the world. And then to bring them back together would be a period of time measured in months rather than weeks. Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Understood, I appreciate that thought. And just a follow-up, Richard, as you look out through 2017 in the marketplace and, of course, you've had some labor issues yourselves, do you anticipate we're going to see more difficult negotiations among some of your peers and competitors around the world, as labor starts to feel a little bit better about their positioning? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, I was just down in Chile at the Cesco Group and saw a number of my associates in the industry. And we were all talking about that versus a correlation between copper prices and labor problems. And so, as the copper prices increase, that's heightened the aspirations of labor for better deals, and then I always say that labor problems are contagious disease that once someone experienced one, they tend to happen in other places and we've certainly seen that with Escondida, ours, the Southern Copper situation and unions are talking everywhere about the situation. Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Understood. Thank you for your thoughts, Richard. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : Thank you very much for taking my question. The mine output appeared to fall at each of the copper mines and I tried to adjust for this sale of 13% at Morenci and 56% of Tenke and estimated that the continuing copper output fell about 11% or 89 million pounds. Could you talk about the rebounds to tons and grade at the mines other than Grasberg to meet your 3.9 billion pound forecast for the year? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah. There was some impact in Cerro Verde from the weather and the strike situation. The principal impact of that's going to be longer term than I mentioned because we kept our mill basically running during the quarter, but our mine rate was \u2013 in the month of March, we have about half of what it has been in the first two months. Now, we returned that to that level, but that's going to have some ongoing impact. The rest of it, John, is just normal issues you face in running a business like ours. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: But we're not showing \u2013 John, we're showing the first quarter looking pretty similar to the rest of the year on a quarterly basis in the Americas. So, really, it's \u2013 Indonesia is the change, so there's really not a big change in the overall output in the Americas compared to the first quarter. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Novid Rassouli with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Novid Rassouli - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, Richard and Kathleen. Thanks for taking my questions. I was curious if the Indonesian government has backed off the divestment requirement at replacement costs or if there have been any developments there? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, that was in the \u2013 that was the subject to one of the new regulations that was adopted in January, and that regulation is still in place. And that's going to be one of the issues under discussion as we enter into these negotiations. Novid Rassouli - Cowen & Co. LLC: Got it. Two other quick ones. Can you just comment on Cerro Verde's production profile over the next three years, and maybe the stability that you see there? Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah, we're expected to be just shy of 1.1 billion pounds at Cerro Verde this year, and it's pretty consistent over the next few years. Novid Rassouli - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. And then lastly, I know it's a small piece at this point, but any guidance that you can provide on the oil and gas production with respect to either revenue or costs? Thank you. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: In terms of oil and gas, it's down to a very small number, we're producing in the shale for the Gulf of Mexico. We've got something onshore in the Gulf Coast region and now in offshore California. But just from an overall EBITDA standpoint, it's a very small contribution, it was slightly negative in the first quarter. Novid Rassouli - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And the more significant issue we're working on to manage is the abandonment costs that we faced as a result of this business. So, that's something that's getting a lot of attention, and we're continuing to unwind some commitments on cost that is a carry-over for certain facilities and office space and so forth, but we've made a lot of progress with that. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Evan Kurtz with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Good morning. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So, just one more on Grasberg. One of the issues, I guess, key sticking point here is this 51% number that's out there. And I know in the past you seemed fairly reluctant to give up majority ownership of PT-FI. And I just kind of wanted to take your temperature, is that something that you'd be a little bit more open to than you have been in the past and is that really on the table, or is that something that you're going to really push back on hard? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Evan, the worst thing I could do is, get out in front of the negotiations and discussions in answering a question like that. As I mentioned, the issue of divestment is on the table. And that's going to cover the range of issues, including the percentage of the investment, the process for divesting, the valuation for divesting and the carry-on issues related to operatorship and governance of PT-FI. So, I think, at this point, the only thing I can say is that those are on the table. Our broad objectives, as we go into the negotiations, are going to be to protect the value of this asset for our shareholders and to find a way to reduce the risk that's overhanging the situation now and provide a stability for the long term. And we need to have that stability to warrant these investments. I mean we've been running this business for years and the government has been cooperating with us on it by making investment for production that's to be received beyond 2021. So, we have to get that situation clarified and de-risked. The one thing that we will insist on that any divestment to be made on the basis of the fair value of the assets. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. And maybe an easier question to answer, but I know that part of the deal with China Moly included a later negotiation on selling Freeport Cobalt, the Kokkola operation. Is that something that happened and maybe it's just too small to report or is that still underway? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: That has not happened and with the dramatic change in the cobalt market, that's occurred since we closed our deal with China Moly. That matter is under discussion, so it is \u2013 let me just leave it at that. It hasn't happened, it's under discussion. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Does that mean that you might be able to keep that or have you committed to sell it at this point? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: No, we didn't commit to sell it, we committed to give them an opportunity to negotiate with us for it. But we didn't agree \u2013 it wasn't a price that was agreed to, and there was no firm commitment on either party to close the transaction. Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks for that. Thank you guys. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, everyone. We look forward to reporting further progress. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then will turn the call over to Richard, who'll review our performance and outlook using the prepared slide presentation. As usual, after our formal remarks, we'll open up the call for questions. Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $268 million, or $0.18 per share for the second quarter of 2017. The results from the second quarter include net gains of $27 million, or $0.01 a share associated with a number of special items which are detailed on VIII of our press release. After adjusting for these net gains, second quarter adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $241 million, or $0.17 a share. Our EBITDA or adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation for second quarter totaled $1.2 billion. We've got a reconciliation of our EBITDA calculation on the last page of out slide deck. Our sales for the second quarter totaled 942 million pounds of copper, 432,000 ounces of gold, and 25 million pounds of molybdenum. Our sales volume for copper were about 3% below our April 2017 estimates. That primarily reflected the impact of the worker absenteeism on our mining and milling rates in Indonesia. The second quarter average realized copper price was $2.65 a pound. That was over 20% above the year-ago quarter average of $2.19 per pound, and gold prices averaged $1,243 for the quarter. Our average unit net cash cost on a consolidated basis averaged $1.20 per pound of copper in the second quarter, that was lower than the unit net cash cost of $1.33 per pound in the second quarter of 2016 and it was also in line with our guidance. Operating cash flows during the quarter totaled $1 billion; those exceeded our capital expenditures of $362 million in the quarter. Year-to-date, we've generated operating cash flows of $1.8 billion, which have exceeded our year-to-date capital spending of $700 million. At June 30, our consolidated debt totaled $15.4 billion and we ended the quarter with $4.7 billion in consolidated cash. Net debt is $1.1 billion lower than the start of the year and notably $9.5 billion less than the start of 2016. We had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility and approximately $3.5 billion available at the end of June. At June 30, FCX had 1.45 billion common shares outstanding. I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be using the slide presentation materials on our website. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Want to give you an update of where our company stands right now. I got to tell you, we've had a high degree of optimism about our business as we're here in the midst of 2017. As we do before every earnings call, we had our global operating team together last week. Red Conger's here, Mike Kendrick's here and Mark Johnson is on the call. And our team is really focused, continue to execute our plans, looking forward to the future and analyzing where our company is going to ultimately grow from this great set of assets that we have. But we've all focused on cost management and you can see the results of that, good achievement with that. We've got ongoing capital discipline. We've got a portfolio of growth projects that we're doing work to prepare ourselves for future investments, but we're not committing to projects now, which is common across the copper industry worldwide. There's still enough of an uncertainty in the global economy and that's keeping people from going in and investing heavily on growth projects, but we've got a good set of them that we're going to be prepared to invest in the future and we're convinced that the world is going to need that copper. We have some issues to continue to talk about in Indonesia, but we've made a lot of progress there. And we do have a degree of optimism about our work with the government, about operationally how we're dealing with our labor issues that's been issues for us during the first half of the year and making progress. Kathleen pointed out that we have reduced our debt since we set our targets in early \u2013 going into 2016. At that time, we said we were going to try to reduce debt by $5 billion to $10 billion over the two-year period ending year-end 2017. To-date, it's been $9.5 billion. As Kathleen said, to-date, we've generated significantly higher cash flow than our capital expending, well over $1 billion. So, we've already achieved our target. We're going to continue to generate cash to reduce debt. And now that our balance sheet issues, which dominated our activities last year, are resolved, we are focusing on operations and looking at safety issues, which has always been at the top of our list of things, being more efficient. The primary strategic issue we face is resolving the long-term rights in Indonesia and I'll be talking about that. But we're also focused on building long-term values in our portfolio of copper assets and we are optimistic about the future of copper as a commodity and as future price. Very well pleased that after going through the efforts to reduce debt, we've retained a set of assets that are really attractive in terms of building our company around. We do have now $8.2 billion in liquidity, looking at our cash and our availability on our revolver. So, we continue to generate cash, allows us to improve our balance sheet. Today is a good day in the copper market. I can't tell you how many days we've had earnings call when we wake up in the morning and say, oh, we wish we had a higher copper price, but today is a good day. We're not surprised by this at all. The market fundamentals remain solid. What we're seeing is in the face of a stronger U.S. dollar, Chinese demand is better than most expected during the first half of 2017 and now. As I was coming up in the copper business, we always talked about the summer doldrums. I mean just, historically, as you went into the August, in the copper industry, you typically saw demand fall off, inventory rise. Well, we're in the summer doldrums. It's typically not a great time for demand in China. And so it's encouraging to see this \u2013 to see European demand improving, North America growing at a low rate. But the fundamental support for it is the supply side issues and that's coming clearly into focus. We're seeing a return to more typical disruptions. We had a period of time of \u2013 where disruptions were lower than historical amounts. We're seeing now issues related to labor, technical issues, issues with government and all so forth that's being supportive from a supply standpoint. They remains a scarcity of major new projects available to the industry. The projects that are available longer-term are lower quality than historically were available. And so, copper is very well placed among commodities because of the role of copper in the global economy, the supply side, the supportive things and also the uses of copper that are emerging in terms of the development of alternative energy sources and ultimately with mechanization of the economy, including electric vehicles. So, copper has a solid fundamental outlook. Our company is well-positioned with the assets that we have. Wood Mackenzie shows, even with the modest demand growth of 1% globally per year, they estimate 5 million tons of new copper projects will be required to meet demand from the supply situation that we face. Now, we know, because we're studying this every day, that new copper projects and ours that we have are greenfield, I mean, brownfield projects, using existing infrastructure, low risk execution projects and we showed what we can do with the Cerro Verde project, but we know that they require $3 plus copper to make them justified. There's a 7-year to 10-year lead time and greenfield projects are really scarce. So there is a deficit looming, absent any big disruption in the world's economy or in China. There is an inevitable deficit that will allow our company to really profit from it. I've read some recent reports of people who have been bearish on copper outlook for some time now that are talking about prices being required for new projects as being substantially lower than we see in our portfolio. And we believe we have the best portfolio in the industry to go forward. So, anyway, we're encouraged by that. Talking about the Americas operations, strong operating performance. The Cerro Verde expanded operations continued to perform well. We're looking at a project near our Safford mine in Eastern Arizona where we have an ore body that some of you recall us talking about in the past called Lone Star. As the Safford mine is depleting from the oxide minerals that we have there, we're pointing towards a plan of producing oxide from the Lone Star deposit, which would make use of these facilities that we have available and also serve to expose a very large sulfide resource at Lone Star that underlies the oxide ore body. Using existing infrastructure, this project would be easy, relatively easy. We had grievances a little bit when I say that, but relatively easy to undertake and give us the opportunity for some significant investments in the large sulfide resource, both at Lone Star and at Safford in the future. In Chile, at our El Abra project, where we're partners with CODELCO, our exploration that we've done over the past 10 years \u2013 we just celebrated our tenth year anniversary of the Phelps Dodge deal \u2013 have identified a very significant sulfide resource that we didn't know existed at the time of the transaction. This would be a Cerro Verde type project, although it would require a desalinization plant and pipelines to get the water to heights. It's a big project, but it's a very attractive project long run. And we're working with our partner, CODELCO, and other resource land owners in the area to tee it up for future investments. And then in the U.S., we have a whole series of sulfide opportunities that we're continuing to study. We're serious about this. I mean, we believe we'll make these investments in the future. We're just not making them right now because as we assess the markets, on slide 6, we have in alphabetical order these projects that we have available in the Americas outside of Lone Star. They are in the United States. The United States has strategic benefits today that it didn't have in the past for this \u2013 other than El Abra, because of the energy situation here, which is an advantage for the U.S. with shallow oil and gas development. The labor situation here is we don't have unions in the United States. We have communities that support our business. And so, it's an attractive place to invest and the resources, as you can see in these charts, where we've got significant currently identified proved and probable reserves, the mineralized material and the resources beyond that are enormous. So, this will be where we'll be focusing the future of our company on. So, in Indonesia, our exports resumed in April. We experienced a high level of worker absenteeism during the second quarter that actually began in mid-April and that had an impact on our mining and milling rates. Despite the lower rates, we have been mining higher ore grades and we had the ability to sell from inventory that built up during the time that we were restricted from exports. We have had a significant reduction in our workforce there. Workers that were absent were given notice as required under our labor contract and under Indonesian law. Many of those did not return to work and they were deemed to have retire \u2013 to have resigned. And we are now in the process of using contractors to supplement our workforce by these significant number of people that are no longer employees. You read about calls for strikes. We want to say that there is no general strike. We went into the year with over 30,000 workers; over 25,000 of those were not involved in this absenteeism. They continue to work and so we are using this as an opportunity to really deal with some workforce issues that have been with us for some time now. And we're encouraged that we'll be able to do that; we've got support from the authorities, it's been peaceful and we are working our way back towards normal operations. We are looking at ways of improving our operations through sloped optimization efforts, and we are looking at accessing what was designed to be produced from the underground Grasberg Block Caves through open pit mining. So, we're actually feeling good about where we are right now. The team has done a great job in managing this adjustment in our workforce. We had, for example, about 4,000 of these workers that were deemed to have resigned. Now, in terms of the contract issues, with the discussions with the Government of Indonesia, those are very active right now. And we're now approaching a stage where both parties have expressed an objective of a near-term resolution. And I believe we are seeing that objective being more clearly identified by the senior levels in the Indonesian government than we have seen in the past. Our team in Jakarta has been working in a process that we established back in May, to have discussions with the ministries that are involved in this and our team. We are now at the point of moving those discussions to direct discussions with the lead ministers and with the government, I'm personally involved in those as I have been all along with the process. So we're going to be talking about mutual objectives of extending our operating right, providing Freeport the required assurances about fiscal and legal terms that would give us the confidence to invest in these big underground projects that we have in our plans. We are being responsive to the goals of the Indonesian government about divestment and about smelter investments. We have an understanding that any divestments that we have would have to be a fair market value from our perspective and that Freeport would continue to have operational and governance control over the operation. So we're moving to the next stage. We have a mutual sense of optimism that we can find an agreement. At the end of the day, it's in all of our interest. It's the interest of the country, our shareholders, the workers, the Province of Papua and so we will \u2013 we are working on that every day. We do have an issue that we need to \u2013 that affected our outlook near-term. So, we are developing \u2013 we were starting up our most recent extension of our underground mine where Freeport had been conducting block caving operations since the early 1980s and we keep going deeper. The recent ore from this section of our operations has come from a mine called the Deep Ore Zone mine called DOZ. And we've extended that through our exploration activity to a lower horizon and we call this new mine the Deep MLZ. And as we've gone deeper, we've encountered a different rock environment than we had at shallower elevations. The rock is more dense, harder. We're going deeper. And in June, we experienced what we are calling a mining-induced seismic activity, which is not uncommon in block caving mines, we've had it in the past, but this was a more significant event for us. It has caused us to slow down the initial ramp-up to make sure that we're managing this rock stress in a safe way and in a prudent way to protect the people and the resources in our underground development until the cave is sustained in a normal fashion. So, we had a plan going into the second quarter for ramp-up that now we are slowing down as we deal with this situation. We still \u2013 there has been nothing that has affected the resource that we're developing and nothing for us to change our plans to ramp this mine up to 80,000 tons a day, which is very large for our block caving operations by 2021. But it is resulting because of the slowdown and based on what we know today, in deferrals that we've incorporated in our plans, which is reducing our metal by 100 million pounds of copper this year, 200 million next year, and also deferring gold as part of the component of this. Couple of points about this. This is a \u2013 as I said, this is an extension of an ore body that's not part of the Grasberg ore body, but this is an ore body that we began mining in the early 1980s and have kept extending it at depth. The ore body underlying the Grasberg is the same ore body we're mining from the open pit and its rock characteristics are much different and we're real comfortable that this situation we have here will not automatically transfer over to the Grasberg because of the nature of the rock differences. Any event, we are working with a world-class team of geologists and engineers and we're putting safety first. And \u2013 but we're looking for ways of advancing this. And once we get to the point of having the caving operating in a normal fashion, then we'll be back on track to our original plans and nothing has changed that. So we'll be talking a lot as we go forward about the block caving designs. This Grasberg Block Cave is just amazing in terms of its size. When this is completed, this will be the world's largest underground mining operations and we're very comfortable that we can manage this. You can see it has almost \u2013 the Grasberg Block Cave has almost a billion tons of reserves with over 1% copper and 0.78 grams per ton of gold. It's an extraordinarily high rate of return investment. The Grasberg Block Cave, for example, is bigger than the Morenci mine, which is our flagship mine here in North America. It's a state-of-the-art system. Block Cave has complicated operations, but we're very experienced with this and it's going to be a real source of pride for \u2013 not only for our company, but for the country of Indonesia and having this kind of development. This \u2013 slide 10 shows you the history of block caving. This is a separate mineralization from the Grasberg Block Cave, separate from the original Ertsberg deposit, which Freeport began mining in the early 1970s, but it began with a mine that's called the GBT, which is depleted by the late 1970s. In the late 1990s, we were developing the IOZ mine, which is depleted. We moved to the DOZ and now this is, as you can see, proportionately, this is a larger high-grade ore body called the Deep MLZ mine and that's where we're dealing with this startup issue. With our negotiations advancing in a positive way with the government, we are dealing with a number of ministries. We're all focused on the financial benefits to Indonesia that our operations provide. We've been there a long time. We've contributed $60 billion to the national Gross Domestic Product since our current contract was signed in 1992. Very significant part of the region and the regency where we're located, we're over 90% of the economy, by far the largest employer in Papua, one of the largest taxpayers. We contribute through our community programs a very significant amount, almost $700 million, since we started this 1% fund in 1996. So, both sides are working now constructively towards a solution. The challenge we're going to face is to take this mutual objective of finding a solution and converting it into an agreement and supporting regulations that's acceptable to both parties. That's not underestimating that, but we are approaching this with a degree of optimism and it's clear that the senior government people working with too have that objective as well. 2017 outlook is presented on page 12, with the adjustments because the Deep MLZ startup issues, we are now projecting copper at 3.7 billion pounds, gold at 1.6 million ounces and 93 million pounds of molybdenum. Site production delivery costs are in line with our previous estimates and after byproduct credits, we're now suggesting $1.19. Operating cash flows will continue to be strong and capital expenditures will continue to be significantly lower than our cash flows. Sales profile is shown for 2016, 2017 and 2018 on slide 12. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: 13. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Slide 13, I'm sorry. And you can see this is now net of the sale of our Tenke mine that we sold in the Congo to China Molybdenum and the incremental interest in Morenci that we sold to our partner Sumitomo. So that's what our sales look like. EBITDA and cash flows for 2018 now at $1,250 gold, $7.50 molybdenum and copper prices varying from $2.50 to $3 are shown on slide 14. You can see that goes from just over $5.5 billion of EBITDA to about $7.5 billion over that range. And with cash flows going from $3.4 billion to $4.8 billion, we're highly leveraged to copper. Each $0.10 is $280 million and before this call, we were close to $0.10 up today. Capital expenditures show the termination of capital spending in the oil and gas business and we currently are continuing to invest in the Grasberg Block Cave which has for 2017, $700 million of investment and $750 million for 2018. With the agreement with Government of Indonesia, we'll proceed with that. If we are unexpectedly unable to reach an agreement with the government, then we would take the steps of stopping that spending, it would be a major adjustment to our activities at PT-FI and would have a deferral in the ramp-up, which in blockade mining, it takes a period of time to ramp up once you start the mining operations, which we can't do at the Grasberg Block Cave until we finish mining the open pit. So, our current plan is to do this. If we're not to be successful in our discussions with the government, those CapEx would be suspended for major adjustments in our operations and we would be moving on to a resolution through arbitration, which we don't want, the government doesn't want, that's why the momentum is to find the solution. And that's what our plans are based on. Kathleen and her team did a great job in amending and extending the Cerro Verde credit facility. The details of that are on page 16. As we go forward, we will continue to look for steps of managing our balance sheet and our maturities over long periods of time. It was a very highly successful syndication and it reflects the strength of this great asset. And one of the \u2013 maybe the best thing that came out of this asset restructuring and capital raising activity that we did in last year was that we kept Cerro Verde and we're building our company around it as we go forward in the future. You can see our debt reductions going from over $20 billion to net debt now being $10.7 billion, and then where that would move to with just using cash flows. We're no longer looking at any kind of capital raising through sales of stock or sales of assets. We'll do some small sales of assets in ordinary course of business, but as I said, we basically reached our goals with our balance sheet. And now we're focused on safe production from our current sets of assets with this great team of operators and development and we got the financial strength to go forward. And we're focused on resolving the situation in Indonesia and we currently believe we're seeing good progress with that, and then looking for the day of when the market will be such that we will be investing in growth in our assets and looking for opportunities outside of our company. We're all focused on building shareholder value; that's all we're about and we look for alternative ways of doing that because that's our job at the end of the day. So, with that, we will open the line for questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Couple questions from me, mainly relating to Grasberg, as you would expect. The first one just on the underground development, you'd hinted that that was your plan of balancing act there during the year of keeping enough labor in place, so that you don't stop completely. When you say it's been slowed now, is there a different development compared to last quarter or is it more of the same? And then also, can you just speak a little bit more about the opportunity to mine from the open-pit part of what would have previously been in the underground? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Okay. So with your first question, I want to make sure that we're clear on this. There is the Block Cave underground development activities. And then there is the startup of the Deep MLZ mine, which is beginning \u2013 it's moving to its operating phase. The development activities now are focused in the underground Block Cave at the Grasberg mine underneath the pit. Okay. And that's a major development project that we've literally been working on for eight years or so and developing access to it and getting that mine prepared to start up when we complete mining in the pit. We did reduce some of our capital spending when we were facing the issues with the government that emerged in January of 2017. But we've made a decision so far to keep spending on that development activities and nothing has changed during the quarter on that. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: We cut it by about 25% earlier this year, Chris, but nothing has changed in recent months on it. We're evaluating it on a month-by-month basis. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And moving to your second question, as we continue to develop this and as we're completing mining at the pit, as you would expect, there is ongoing efforts to try to optimize the mining at the final stages of operations at the pit. And Mark Johnson and his team are looking at ways of adjusting pit slopes \u2013 deepening pit slopes, looking at ways that we can take advantage of our existing fleet of open pit mining equipment, the shovels and trucks and so forth. Some of that's been delayed by this issue of the export ban. There was a period of time of where the smelter in Indonesia was down earlier this year. So that's given us opportunities and time to see how can you optimize the final stages of mining from the pit. And that's what we're talking about there. Then we move over to the Deep MLZ mine, of where we had completed the initial stages of development, in Block Cave mining there is ongoing development activities that occur once you start the caving operations. But we were in the startup of actually developing the draw points for the operations through a combination of undercut development and mining material from the draw points as they started out when we ran into this issue related to this mining and do seismic activity. And so, we stepped back from that for a period of time and we're sequentially approaching undercut development and mucking mining, which we were doing together before until we get to the point of where the caves are operating in a normal fashion. So that's a separate issue from the underground development at the Grasberg Block Cave. Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Richard, for the color. And then just in terms of the discussions with the government that you're still having, are you able to rank, I guess, from maybe the government side what they say is the most important, including the smelter, the final ownership status, timelines, taxes, royalties, et cetera? Like what's the key sticking point there? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, what we have is an effort that's designing a solution in one agreement to address all of these issues. We both have agreed that we're going to have a global solution to the issues as a package and the keys from the government standpoint are the ones that you mentioned. They want to see divestment. Their objective is to have, over time, a point where we reach a 51% ownership by Indonesian interest. Currently 9.36% is owned by the government. They've set a strong objective of seeing new smelter capacity developed in Indonesia and then preserving the fiscal revenues from taxes and royalties that the government has because that's important to us. From our standpoint, our objective is having the government approve our rights to an extension that we have under our existing contract. And that goes to 2041 and that \u2013 and to have that approval, have fiscal and legal terms that have assurances and a commitment by the government to those over time, so that they can't be changed by subsequent laws and regulations. And that any divestment that occurs \u2013 and we're talking at this final stages about we had originally agreed to 30%, the government wanted 51%, so that's a matter to be dealt with in the final negotiations. But whatever that comes up to that any divestment be done, so that we are paid a fair value for the divested shares. And that Freeport \u2013 there is an agreement that Freeport will continue as operator and we have to \u2013 to do that, we have to have the rights to operate the business as we determine it should be operated and that we also have control over the governance of the operations. And so, those are the issues. And we've agreed to deal with them as a package and that's what we are doing as we speak. Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Richard. One final one, is there any update on Kokkola in Finland? What value you could extract there versus the original thoughts? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: No. We have a lot of interest as you can imagine both with that and with the Kisanfu exploration, a property that's near Tenke, which we had an agreement with China Moly that they would have a right to negotiate with us on it. We weren't able to reach an agreement with them on the valuation. There's been such a change in the cobalt market, of course, since we closed our transaction on Tenke. And we've had a lot of incoming interest. We're having discussions with people, but we haven't established a formal process for how to go forward. Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's it from me. Thanks, guys. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Novid Rassouli with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Novid Rassouli - Cowen and Company, LLC: Hey, Richard and Kathleen. So, Richard, when you were discussing the Indonesia situation down at CESCO, you'd mentioned that you guys and the Indonesian government are not really starting from scratch and that the discussions are far along several years, you guys have been discussing this. And that you're hopeful that the six-month extension is all that's necessary given the background and history of the negotiations. I was just wondering that was quite a laundry list of topics that you just listed out on what needs to be decided on. So I just want to see if you can give us an update on how you're thinking about the situation now. Do you see an ability to have something done by October and if anything has changed in your thinking since you kind of presented that view to us down at CESCO? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yes. Well, I guess, from our perspective, this is not a big laundry list of items. I mean, it is divestment, smelter, fiscal terms, extension and those \u2013 it's really four items. There has been a significant movement within the Indonesian government of where I think coming from the senior level of government there is a real objective of wanting to get this resolved now that we just haven't seen in the past. And so, we remain focused on getting an agreement done this year and that is consistent with what the government's objective is as well. So there's a lot of things going on within Indonesia and its economy, their geopolitical issues that we read about everything in the paper in Southeast Asia. There is political developments as always within the Indonesian government, and all those things are coming to bear. We are having a \u2013 we're seeing a much greater interest by officials in the U.S. government in this administration to be supportive of businesses generally, but particularly, our situation in Indonesia. We're working \u2013 it's our responsibility to negotiate with the government and that's what we're doing. But there is a lot of circumstances that are leading us to a point of where we're at the point we are now of working to get an agreement. And if it can be done, now is the time going to be to do it. I mean, we're clear this is the effort that we're going to pursue. It's not going to be any memorandums of understanding or assurance letters or any of the things we've had in the past, but we're running this to ground right now. Novid Rassouli - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. And the next step from that would be, I guess, arbitration? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: If we're unsuccessful, then that's the recourse that each party has to resolve a dispute. We gave notice about \u2013 of the dispute earlier this year. There was a 120-day notice period that has now run its course. So at this point, either party is free to initiate arbitration proceedings. And as you can imagine, we're doing a lot of behind-the-scenes work to prepare for that if it's something we have to do. We feel very strong about our legal position in this, but we also recognize that it's not desirable for either party to go that route. And so we're in effect reserving our rights, the government has rights as well, but we're working together to get this resolved and that's \u2013 and we're approaching it \u2013 we're both approaching it I think for maybe the first real time before there is a consistent point of view about wanting to get it resolved. Novid Rassouli - Cowen and Company, LLC: Got it. And then just one follow-up, Richard. So, you guys had mentioned you're taking steps to increase the workforce or PT-FI is taking steps to increase the workforce. Curious if there is any significant lead time to kind of train the additional workers to restore normal operating rates and if future strikes \u2013 potential future strikes would have an immediate impact or if the new workforce would kind of have some sort of a buffer built in? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, what's going on as we're doing this is the activity in the pit is ramping down, whereas once we were mining 800,000 tons a day, there were some days we even had a million tons a day, metric tons of mining in the pit. Today, our plan calls for about 100,000 tons. So, there is less work being done in the pit and that's where this absenteeism was focused. And what we're doing is rather than hiring new employees is working through contractors to hire people, often people who are experienced in coal mining and other activities for our truck operations and so forth. So, it is taking some time, but we're close back to meeting our plans with activity as we speak now. And all this activity really has not had a significant impact in our underground development activities. That's a separate set of workers, they haven't been, in large part \u2013 they weren't involved in this absenteeism, while you read about a strike \u2013 there has not been a formal strike declared. The union tops have called for a strike, but in any event, it's not like the workforce went on strike, there were some workers that didn't come to work. And unfortunately after notification, some of them have lost their jobs and that's not good for anybody, but we've had to manage it that way to keep control of our operations. Novid Rassouli - Cowen and Company, LLC: Got it. Thanks, Richard. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Hey, Mike. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Hi, Mike. Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC : You got controllable and uncontrollable issues always. You guys have done a pretty good job on the controllable issues, you get a little bit help from the uncontrollable with copper going up, but you still got to deal with this Indonesia issue, which is, in my mind, a big uncontrollable. And I think the main \u2013 one of the main things I hear Freeport say that they need is assurances that the contract of work terms which have gone on now to 2041 are upheld. But how do you really get assurances of that since my understanding of the original contract of work was that it superseded any changes in Indonesian government law when it was signed and that that included the extensions, which were basically up to you guys in 2021 and 2031 to bring up to 2041. So basically, what's really to stop the government from changing their mind a year or two from now even if they say, okay, we're going to uphold the 2041 term of the contract life? How do you get assurances that they don't break the contract again? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So, repeating some of the things you said, the contract was signed in 1991. It had a 30-year primary term and it contained provisions giving us the right to two 10-year extensions of that contract. It wasn't like a renegotiating contract. And that came about because that's what Indonesian law allowed at that time. Under the Indonesian law at 1991, they only had the right to issue a 30-year contract. So, what you have in Indonesia and any other country is a sovereign government which has the right to adopt whatever laws and regulations they decide they should adopt. And Indonesia passes new mining law in 2009, which triggered the current controversy between us. The protection that we have under our contract and the protection that we are insisting be preserved going forward is that if in fact the government does change its mine as you say and takes actions through laws, regulations or whatever to take value away from what we're entitled to under our agreement, then we have the right to go to international arbitration, a legal proceeding that is structured to be fair, not something that goes through the Indonesian court system and we would have the right to financial compensation for actions that the government has taken. We have that right now because the contract says very clearly, the government can't restrict exports, well, the government has restricted exports in the past. The government is obligated to give us this extension. They haven't approved the extension yet. And what we've tried to do Mike and some of these things are uncontrollable, some of them are under our control and what we try to do is find a way to preserve the values for our shareholders and be responsive to the aspirations and desires of the government and find a compromise. But as part of that compromise, we are insisting that we retain going forward the rights to international arbitration and the rights to financial claims if the government subsequently doesn't honor the contract. Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Understand. Is there any way for you to estimate what your results for the quarter would have looked like if none of this would have happened in terms of the contract would have never been questioned from 2009 on and you are operating under the contract of work. How different would your results be today? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, let's see. We would have completed mining the open pit last year, in 2016. And if you go back and review what our plans were, then we would have had an extraordinary year in 2015 and 2016, over 3 million ounces of gold and large copper billings. But for 2017, we would have completed mining the pit and we would be ramping up the Deep MLZ. So, remember we used to talk about that falloff, the wedge and we were talking about how to offset that through stockpiles and things. So, we would have had extraordinary years in 2015-2016. You can go out and assume we didn't do the oil and gas deal. That would have made a difference. We wouldn't have been selling assets and doing all the selling stock and doing all the things we had to do to pay that debt off. So, I'll answer your question, but I don't allow myself to go back and say, would have, could have, should have deal. We're in the here and now. We have control over a lot of things including some of the issues with the government and we're working hard to deal with those issues. Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC : But the would have, could have, should have, if you don't get a deal with the government and you do go to arbitration, I would assume some of the would have, could have, should have would go into your estimate of what you've lost in terms of value. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: No question, no question. I mean we would \u2013 and so this arbitration claim, again, I want to emphasize because I know my friend in Indonesia are listening to this and I'm speaking clearly that we don't want to do that, we want to find a mutually agreeable solution. But if we don't, the claims are going to be very large. Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sure. Yes. I would imagine. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Because it's a big asset. Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Huge asset. Huge difference in performance under the contract of work and what's happened. And how would that transpire assuming you don't get an agreement, you go to arbitration, you win the arbitration, what happens next in terms of how do you receive proceeds or value consideration? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, it gets to be an obligation of the Government of Indonesia. I mean, that's an obligation under their law. And then there's steps you can take internationally to enforce that as well. There has been some precedent for that, of where \u2013 other countries. Indonesia had a case several years ago as well, and so there's processes to follow. Indonesia, as a member of the G20, as a country that's done big picture well economically, they're going to have pressures of wanting to get this resolved in a way that helps them with their bigger picture economic goals, international goals and so forth. So, it's not only Freeport and representing our shareholders that has objectives of resolving this. There are also going to be pressures facing Indonesia and getting it resolved. And I think that's becoming more apparent to them. Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right, okay. Thanks a lot, Richard. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli. Please go ahead. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Hi, everybody. I just, so I was just wondering in terms of your projects and potential projects that \u2013 the expansion projects that you showed in your presentation. If copper were at, say, $3 a pound, say it would go to $3.10 or something like that a pound and it was there for a couple months, do you feel like you currently have the balance sheet to start any of those projects or would you like your balance sheet to be in a better position in terms of your net debt position to start a, I guess, you guys haven't mentioned how big these projects would be, but say, a $1 billion expansion project? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: All right. So \u2013 so Chris. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Yes. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: The short answer to your questions is, yes, the balance sheet is okay, we could do those. But these projects aren't $1 billion projects. I mean, the Cerro Verde project, which was a major expansion, was $4.5 billion \u2013 $5 billion project and it was as well situated a project to do this on that you're ever going to find anywhere in the world, but the El Abra project is a project that would be bigger than that, okay? The \u2013 we could get the start going on the Lone Star/Safford project in that range, okay? Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah, that's less than $1 billion, but it's spent over multiple years. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And yet, to develop the sulfide deposit there is another \u2013 so these are major type projects. And while I think we are on a path towards starting the Lone Star deal, it's not in our numbers now, but I think it will be fairly shortly. But to do one of these multi-billion dollar projects like we would be looking at, at Bagdad and expansion at Sierrita and the sulfide in Safford and so forth. You're going to need to get copper not just for a month or two. You're going to have to have a clear view that the world economy is developing that there are uncertainties that currently overhang the economy in significant ways are clear to go forward. And that's not just for us, but that's for the rest of the industry. So I think before that happens, you're going to see a period of time where there's going to be a shortage of copper and you're not going to see the price of these go to $3. We just need to look over our shoulders and we can see at times we had copper at $4. And we're heading for a world of where that is \u2013 that's I believe is in the cards, that it could even be more than that because the great thing about copper is that when you look at its uses, it's not the component that drives demand. Copper is an important necessary component of those. But so, anyway you've all heard me get on my copper soapbox. That soapbox is, at one point, I was kind of a lone prop in the wilderness. Now there is a choir singing this song. And so \u2013 and yet you don't see people jumping up to invest in new projects and new projects are very scarce. There is some projects that are being completed and so forth, but the wall of copper that was supposed to come about in 2016 didn't show up. And now to justify the coming wall of copper, some people are talking about you can develop these new mines at $2.50 or less and that just can't be done. It just can't be done. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Right. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And when the \u2013 Kathleen is telling me to stop, so I'll get off and so forth. Okay. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay. No, sounded good, the choirs singing sounded good. But the \u2013 but so, right, so what you're saying now Richard, is that you can essentially, at the \u2013 your current balance sheet, current copper price, you'll probably be able to approve the Loan Star oxides, which will essentially replace some of the assets that have been depleted at Safford from what I understand. But these big projects like El Abra, you think that you do have the balance sheet to complete those, but that you wouldn't embark on those unless you saw runway for copper being above $3 a pound and going higher. Is that kind of pretty accurate? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: That is exactly accurate. And I'll just mention one other factor. With everything that we've had going on over the years, we've developed some incredible strong relationships in Asia, I mean in China, Japan, Korea. I mean and we have \u2013 I can't tell you the number of people who want to be our partners going forward. I mean Freeport's earned a lot of respect; by the way we are. You look, we're the operators of all of our projects and we've done kind of every kind of project that can be done. And the people in Asia are hungry for copper and they want to be our partner. So, financing is going to be one of evaluating alternatives as opposed to scramble and to find it. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Okay. Great. And do you have a sense as to, at a given copper price, what kind of IRR on a project you'd be looking for to get it off the ground? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: We don't \u2013 the one thing we've learned, at least I've learnt, is you just don't set a specific hurdle rate. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Right. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: They have a saying around here, figures don't lie, but liars figure. So, what we do is we look at scenarios for what would happen to us if we made an investment, how it fits in with the rest of our portfolio, what kind of exposure do we have for a gain if prices are higher, what kind of risk do we have to manage our portfolio if prices drop. So, you need to have good attractive rates of return because these projects have the risk. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Yeah. Okay. Great. Thanks, Richard. Thanks, Kathleen. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. I still have a couple of follow-up questions on Grasberg. Specifically, I realized the major issues for both you and the government have kind of been known for a while. But what gives you confidence, for example, in terms of a divestment criteria that you can actually get fair value for selling any interest in Grasberg? Has something changed in the last three months to give you more confidence in that? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, what's changed is \u2013 that I've said over and over. I think there is a real objective of getting a deal done now from the government side, as it is from our side. And while the government says we have certain requirements to get a deal done and that it relates to smelter and divestment and financial issues, we said we have requirements to get a deal done. I'm real clear with the government that our shareholders will not accept us not getting fair value for any divestment. I mean, I hear that over-and-over again because they see our rights under arbitration. We know our legal case is strong. So it's a recognition that we recognize what their requirements are. They're recognizing what our requirements are. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: And are you seeing \u2013 your comments suggest that you're actually seeing movement then in terms of sort of the bid/ask spread here in terms of negotiations. Is that fair? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yes. That's fair. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Okay. And I mean your comments about working towards a resolution by the end of the year, that's passed, I think, the October temporary export permit. Would your expectation be that that would just be renewed to kind of keep negotiations going in October? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: My expectation is that we will get it done within the six months period. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: I see. But it might go beyond the current expiry of the \u2013 oh, are you saying you think you might get it done by October? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yes. That's what I expect. Now, look, there are enough people in this call who have heard my expectations to be unfulfilled in the past. So, yeah, realistically, but there's a lot of things. Indonesia has got a 2019 election coming up, et cetera, et cetera and also all those things point to getting a resolution this year. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then just finally, you mentioned with respect to Grasberg production that you're looking at accessing a portion of the Grasberg Block Cave through the open pit. Can you give us a sense of how much additional copper production that could give you in 2018-2019? Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: We'll know more as we mine through some sections. And Mark Johnson is on the line. He can add to this. But we'll know more as we conduct mining to see if we can, in fact, access ore that would have been mined underground over time. And the benefit of taking it from the open pit is you can get it now as opposed to getting it over several years in the future. But it's on the order and we'll know more as we get into it, but it's on the order of couple hundred million pounds of copper and 500,000 ounces of gold. Mark, I don't know if you want to add anything further to that. Mark Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.: No. The one thing I would add is that we've had a very successful campaign on our perimeter blasting. We do a lot of presplitting for our final walls. And, over time, our geotechs, our engineers are gaining confidence that we can continue to leverage on that experience. And we're putting additional resources at that to ensure that the quality of those blasts are such that we maximize this opportunity. All that we're looking at there to is we don't have any expectation that it would cause any other concerns on the high wall. This is upside that would be purely generated on actual results in the field. We're not going to compromise the overall pit stability or any of the operating safety features or standards that we have. So, this will be something, as Kathleen mentioned, we'll know more month-by-month. We've changed some of our blasting practices now. We're mining into the area that we blasted. As we have opportunity to observe the results, we'll be able to add more clarity as to what the upside might be. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Okay. And what would be the expected timeline then to update, say, the mine plan moving forward? Mark Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.: Yeah. The... Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: We'll do it every quarter. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Because we don't have an annual planning process here. We update our plans every quarter and so we'll talk to you in three months about where we stand with. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead. Alex, you may be on mute. Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Sorry about that. Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Good morning. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Hey, Alex. Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I have two questions. The first question, at the Deep MLZ, the geotechnical issues there, you mentioned the impact on production profile. Would you expect any impact on future OpEx and CapEx there? And then second question is also like Grasberg. I think you've been very clear that Freeport needs to keep both operating and governance control. Do you believe \u2013 is there a structure that you could put in place where you could divest 51%, but still be comfortable that you have that governance and operating control or are those two things mutually incompatible, i.e., your maximum divestment should be less than 50%? Thank you. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Okay. So... Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Take the last one and then we'll come back to the first one. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: All right. So with respect to the last one, we are suggesting to the government that the optimal way for us to proceed with divestment would be to start with a listing on the Indonesian Stock Exchange. And that listing would probably be on the order of a 10% interest. The Indonesian Stock Exchange has gotten to be a fair market. International investors participate in it and so forth. There's lots of discussion within the government about how to proceed with this divestiture deal, but there are ways legally that we're advised that they are working with the government-owned as to how to achieve this objective of maintaining control over governance. And it basically comes down to being able to elect the majority of the Board of Commissioners. That happens internationally with a number of companies in different environments. It was not something unique to Indonesia. Now, the second question has to do with the OpEx and CapEx. It is more of a question of timing. We're going to do some things sequentially that we were doing concurrently initially in terms of developing undercuts and mucking ore. So it doesn't fundamentally change the cost structure at all, but there is the timing impact and so that has some consequence to it. What we believe will happen is that as we get the mine in position and caving starts in a normal fashion, then we'll go back to the same plan we've had all along. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And we have been following protocol with respect to ground support, et cetera. And this mine is requiring investment in significant ground support, more than what we've had in the DOZ, for instance. But the good news is that all of that is \u2013 with this significant event we had in June, all of that held up very well. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yes. And there were no injuries, I want to be clear there, no people were hurt. There was some damage to the mine infrastructure, but no major loss of equipment or things like that. And so there's no real change in the fundamental plan that we're on, it's more of a delay. Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you, very clear. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with FBR & Company. Please go ahead. Lucas N. Pipes - FBR & Co.: Yes. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Richard, you just mentioned how you would approach the question of obtaining fair value for 10% stake of PT-FI. What do you think is the bid/ask spread on that specific point, so how would the Government of Indonesia address that question? Thank you. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So, we have really not engaged in any negotiations on fair value. In early 2016, we voluntarily submitted a valuation of PT-FI at that time to the government, but there has been no formal response to that. You see some comments in the press that we see, but we really haven't gotten to the point of having a bid/ask. Lucas N. Pipes - FBR & Co.: When do you think this will come up in the negotiations? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: As we complete the negotiations, that's \u2013 the process for divestment, the standards of divestment will be part of the ultimate agreement on the package that we have. It won't be an issue of agreeing on a valuation, but the process of how do you get to a fair value \u2013 valuation. And recently, I noted that the government put out a positive comment about having natural resource companies operating in Indonesia be listed on the Indonesian exchange. And again, that's, that in our view is the fairest way of seeing what the value of this business is, let us get an agreement that settles things down, pick an appropriate time, go out, have a fully marketed interest. I know from talking with investors, there would be investor interest in investing in this asset and in that way, you have a market-based determination of fair market value. Lucas N. Pipes - FBR & Co.: That's helpful. Thank you. And then a quick question on the CapEx side and you mentioned that you expect to spend about $700 million on the underground development and that it depends on a resolution of the PT-FI long-term rights. So if the status quo persists hypothetically through the end of the year, would you still expect to spend $700 million or does it depend on a \u2013 does the $700 million depend on a resolution at a given time before the end of the year? Thank you. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So, the $700 million is our current spend rate. So, I think you can anticipate that as we go through this year and engage in our discussions, unless they just were to fall apart which I don't expect, that you can anticipate that we'd be spending that $700 million, now we got $750 million booked for next year and that's dependent on getting the agreement. Lucas N. Pipes - FBR & Co.: Great. Thank you. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thank you, Lucas. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : Thank you very much. Weather.com says the next 15-day temps in Safford vicinity average 96 degrees Fahrenheit highs and 74 degrees Fahrenheit lows, which I guess is a big cool wave. How did you manage to produce copper when it was 123 degrees Fahrenheit highs and 95 degrees Fahrenheit lows? Did the power grid fail on any days, how do you manage equipment utilization and human safety? And second separate question, when will you define a mineral resource for the Lone Star sulfides, where there is only oxide mined so far? And I guess engineering the project requires having a resource. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yes. So, John, operating in the heat in Arizona is kind of like operating in the rain in Indonesia, I mean, that's been part of the business all along, and actually, Red, I'm right in saying, it's hotter in Phoenix than it is typically in Safford and Morenci because of the altitude. And actually when we have operational issues, it's generally when we have unexpected rainfall because a little bit of rain can cause that. Red, you got any... Harry M. \u201cRed\u201d Conger IV - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Just one thing to add John, we do work with our people diligently on hydration and avoiding heat stroke, knowing the signs of overexposure, providing lots of gatorade and water and those kinds of things, air conditioning and equipment. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : So, the regional utility didn't have any failures when it was 123 degrees Fahrenheit in Phoenix? Harry M. \u201cRed\u201d Conger IV - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: No, we did not. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : You don't lose power, they don't call you up and ask you to turn off the electricity at your mines so that it can air condition people's houses? Harry M. \u201cRed\u201d Conger IV - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: No, didn't happen and to Richard's point, when we had the monsoon rainstorms that we have exposure to losing power then. And then just one quick comment on the sulfides there, we've got an active drilling campaign underway now to further define sulfides in that district. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : When will you have a resource at the Lone Star sulfides? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: We have a resource defined. It's an interesting to debate \u2013 to watch Red and his team debate with Kathleen about when are we going to give them enough money to drill that resource to the point of having reserves. But we feel confident, I mean the resource is so large that there is an opportunity for our development there, it is not resource-dependent. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: John, on page 6 of the slide, you can see it's the biggest next to Cerro Verde, the biggest resource in the 266 billion pounds of copper. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Right. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : But it's the possible, it's like not... Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yes, potential. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : Right, right. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Right. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : So, the Dos Pobres and San Juan are the sulfide resources that are in your annual report and not the Lone Star? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah. That's correct. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : So, you got to give Red the money to do what he's got to do. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yes. We haven't added any reserves yet for Lone Star. All right. So you're on that side of the debate. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : We just want you to talk with facts, not \u2013 geologic inference is a little bit like \u2013 we all have dreams. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Right. Right. No take-backs here. Okay. Thanks, John. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : Thank you. I'm sorry to be direct. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: No. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Fawzi Hanano with Berenberg. Please go ahead. Fawzi Hanano - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Good morning, Richard, and Kathleen. Just quick questions, not about the regulatory on Indonesia, but more on the operations side. In terms of milling grades, I've read some articles quoting whether it be correctly or wrongly that you got a targeting 200,000 tons per day run rates with about 140 from the open-pit, 60 from the DOZ. I would like to know what you guys really are targeting particularly at the open-pit before it starts the ramp-down process. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: That's roughly what our plan calls for, what you just mentioned. Fawzi Hanano - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): And would it be towards end of Q3, later this year or in terms of timing, what are you guys planning? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, we've had some recent days of where we've been at 200,000 tons a day. And the reason what we weren't earlier had to do with this worker absenteeism because that was focused on the Grasberg open-pit operations and we weren't meeting our targets for extracting ore from the open-pit. But the mill is all aligned and the mill's capacity is on the order of right mark, 250,000 tons, 260,000 tons per day. There's three separate mill lines and then we're preparing that mill to operate at those higher levels as we achieve our Grasberg Block Cave underground ore in the Deep MLZ in the future. Fawzi Hanano - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Okay. Thanks, Richard. And a quick question on CapEx. Looking at the other mining CapEx to increase about $300 million to $1 billion in 2018, could you give a little bit more color around where that's being allocated? And is this the result of under-spending and sustaining CapEx in the last couple of years? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah. That's \u2013 that's the point I was going to make. We have been, particularly as we went into 2016, but even before that, as the \u2013 when the copper price dropped and as we were facing the financial situation that we faced with the oil and gas investments and the big capital commitments that have been made there that we've now gotten behind us, we were real tough on spending \u2013 on maintenance capital and projects, our guys did a great job of sharing equipment, cannibalizing equipment and so forth, and now, we're at the point of having to go back and do some things that had been deferred in the past. So, that's all that is. It's just \u2013 we meet every quarter. The guys \u2013 Red's on it every day with his team looking at what needs to be done to maintain safe production. And so there's some catch-up type things that we're needing to spend money on. Fawzi Hanano - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Great... Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And to the extent that we can defer it and maintain efficiencies, we continue to look at opportunities to do that. But as you see here, in 2017, we're spending very little on sustaining capital in the Americas and we've got some things as Richard said that we're planning to do for 2018. But teams all focused on, if there are things that we can do to push things out, we'll do it. But we want to maintain the integrity of our equipment. Fawzi Hanano - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): All right. Thanks. Mark Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.: Richard, this is Mark. I just wanted to add what the ore qualities that we have right now. You're right that we have ran \u2013 at least we've ran over $300,000 through our mill. With the type of rock that we'll be running for the remainder of the year will be averaging nearly $200,000. There'll be days obviously it'll be $220,000, $230,000, other days with maintenance, it will be less than that. But fourth quarter, we'll be in the $195,000 range. Fawzi Hanano - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom): Thanks, Mark. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please, go ahead. Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: I'll make it quick. You guys have been very patient. Just \u2013 compared to March, Richard, you talked about you're seeing more typical disruptions in copper supply and mining versus less than typical in the past few years. Is there a chance we see more than just typical as we move forward given all the lack of investment and given the depletion issues that we're seeing in the industry? Thank you. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yes. Michael, that's a good point. There is a correlation between labor issues and copper price. I mean, as the copper price rises, workers globally will be expected to ask for more and you can see what a labor situation can do to the global copper supply with what Escondida went through recently. Contractors will be an issue. Labor issues are particularly sensitive in Latin America, in Chile and Peru, which are the world's two largest copper producing countries, I guess China is in that mix somewhere. But I always say, labor strikes are a contagious disease, so that's \u2013 that can happen. Then as equipment ages and as copper prices rise, people press to give more out of it and that was pressure on mechanical issues, which many of these mines were developed years ago, at Grasberg, our big SAG mill was put in, in the mid-1990s. So as equipment ages, you get stresses mechanically on issues. Then governments start seeing companies making more money and around the world, start seeing other ways of getting more out of it. We went through an issue in the Congo, as some of you may remember, where we had to deal with that, but all those things add up that as copper prices rise, it's sort of a self-fulfilling prophesy that the opportunities for disruptions grow and that, coupled with whatever other dynamics other than rising copper prices, tend to super charge that kind of movement. Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: Richard, best of luck on the negotiations this quarter. Thank you. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Michael. We appreciate your support. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, everyone, thanks for participating. We will be transparent as we go forward and if you have any follow-up questions, check in with David Joint and he'll be responsive to it and look forward to talking about our progress next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2016 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. On the call today are : Richard Adkerson, Red Conger, Mark Johnson, and Mike Kendrick. I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then I'll turn the call over to Richard, who will review our recent performance and outlook and will be using the prepared slide materials that are on our website. As usual, after our prepared remarks, we'll open up the call for questions. Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $280 million or $0.19 per share for the third quarter of 2017. The third quarter results include net charges of $212 million or $0.15 per share for nonrecurring net charges that are detailed on VII of the press release which include a $188 million charge or $0.13 per share associated with accruals for Peruvian government claims associated with disputed royalty matters and $64 million or $0.04 a share charge for adjustment to environmental reserves. After adjusting for these net charges, third quarter 2017 adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $492 million or $0.34 per share. Our adjusted earnings before interest taxes and depreciation or EBITDA for the quarter totaled $1.6 billion. We've got a reconciliation of our EBITDA calculation on the last page of our slide deck. For the third quarter of 2017, we sold consolidated copper sales of 932 million pounds, 355,000 ounces of gold, and 22 million pounds of molybdenum. Our average realized price for the third quarter was $2.94 per pound. That was 34% above the year ago quarter of $2.19 per pound. Our gold price averaged $1,290 per ounce. That was slightly below the year-ago period average of $1,327 per ounce. Average net unit cash costs for the quarter were $1.21 per pound. Those were slightly higher than the year ago period of $1.14 per pound, primarily reflecting lower copper sales volumes. We generated strong operating cash flows during the quarter, which totaled $1.2 billion and those exceeded our capital expenditures of $308 million during the quarter. We ended the quarter at September 30 with consolidated cash of $5 billion and consolidated debt totaling $14.8 billion. We had no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility at September 30 and a strong liquidity position. I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will provide additional details on our results, operations, and outlook. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thank you all for joining us on our call. Kathleen and I are speaking to you from Jakarta where we've made a series of trips this year to work with the Indonesian government on reaching a resolution of our issues involving our contract. Our quarterly results I believe clearly show the strength of our company. During the third quarter we had strong cash flows generated by our operations which are characterized by very long lived assets. We have significant growth optionality that I'll be speaking about during our call today. And now we have the ability to consider these in light of our company's improved balance sheet and the improved copper market conditions. This will enable us to consider future actions to build incremental shareholder value. We're going to approach this in a very disciplined way as producers are throughout the industry. But we have assets within our company that allow us to look forward to a period of future investment and future growth. During the quarter, we continue to advance our key 2017 goals. We're focused on safe and efficient operations, building long-term value through our operation of our business, production of our reserves, and focusing on our attractive portfolio of long-term copper assets. As I mentioned, we are working hard to resolve our long-term rights in Indonesia. During the quarter, we generated almost $900 million of cash flows from operations in excess of our capital expenditures. And for the nine months to-date in 2017, we have approximately $2 billion of cash flows in excess of our capital expenditures. We are benefiting from the positive copper market that has resulted in higher prices than many expected. The analysts who were predicting the so-called wall of copper have capitulated. We were always skeptical about this looming supplies but there are just underlying factors in the industry that continue to constrain supplies. There's continued absence of major new projects, declining production from existing mines, exchange stocks remain historically low. And as we look forward into the future, there are looming significant deficits that will require significant investments to meet, to fulfill the global demand for copper and the prices required to meet that demand are significantly over $3 a pound. What's been a feature of the recent copper market has been positive copper demand globally. Around the world, manufacturing sectors are performing well. Chinese growth is exceeding expectations. And with the recent Congress of the Communist Party in China, the outlook for Chinese growth continues to be positive. Growth is continuing in Europe. And U.S. demand is solid with the prospects for future higher growth as the country addresses its tax situation and other regulatory issues that could unleash continued demand within the United States. Wood Mackenzie, one of the industry's analysts, estimates 5 million tons of new copper projects are required over the next decade. The top 10 mines in the world today produce less than 5 million tons a year. So that shows the extent of the amount of copper projects that will be required to be developed. As I mentioned, new mines require sustained copper prices of well over $3 a pound. The lead time for developing new projects which we know all too well is in the range of 7 to 10 years, and there are very few really world-class opportunities available. An emerging factor for demand in our industry is the electrification of automobiles. EVs are copper intensive. They consumer three or more times more copper than traditional petroleum-powered automobiles, and there's very strong potential for this marketplace. The world is now looking for really expanded growth over the next decade. This will translate into significant incremental copper demand, and the prospects are there because of the economic and environmental benefits of electric vehicles of this evolving much quicker than people are currently estimating. This is clearly on an upward trend and not only automobiles themselves, but the support infrastructure for charging and electrical generation will require copper in significant amounts. We are presenting a slide that we historically presented. I don't think we've used it quite as often recently. But on slide 6, we show the world's largest mines terms of reserves and in terms of 2017 estimated production. Our company has 2 of the top 10 in terms of reserves, 3 of the top 10 in terms of current production. But we always point out the \u2013 to note the dates in which these mines were discovered. There simply has not been recent discoveries of world-class mines. And when we look at the opportunities today, they're in the nature of brownfield expansions of existing resources as opposed to looming major new world-class mines being available to the industry. All of this is very positive for market conditions and supports the industry from a supply standpoint in a way that's not typical for commodity producers. When we look at our company situation, and look at the values that are available to us beyond our existing proved and probable reserves, we have optionality for future development which will be driven by our assessment of value creation in a disciplined way. But these are substantial additional potential from assets that we already own. We're going to remain disciplined, but these are important to looking forward to what the future of our company can be. In the United States, where we benefit from low energy costs, a flexible workforce, an improving regulatory environment, we have a very larger footprint for our large undeveloped sulfide resources. These opportunities are supported by existing infrastructure, which would allow us to make expansions at a series of our mines in a low-risk, high-return environment. In South America, our large resource at our El Abra mine allows us to begin planning for a large-scale mill project to develop the significant sulfide resource we've identified over the last decade. Currently, we're advancing technical studies. And this would be a project that would, in scope, would be similar to our Cerro Verde expansion that we were successfully able to complete and begin production on almost two years ago. Cerro Verde has a large footprint, which will allow it to continue to produce for many years at high levels and low cost, and this would be true at El Abra. It would be an extensive project because we would need to desalinate seawater and transport it to the altitudes there, but it's a large opportunity for us that's very attractive in light of the future copper projects. It will be some time before we'll be going to our board for formal approval of this project, but we will continue to evaluate it. We had a discovery in Serbia where we farmed out an upper zone to allow a smaller company to develop it and in connection with that development there continues to be drilling to the lower zone which is a large high-grade early stage opportunity where we have a significant interest and that has the opportunity to develop into a world-class mine. The Grasberg district in Indonesia, beyond its very large proved and probable reserves, has significant mineralized material that we will continue to evaluate and bring into our mine plans as we go forward as economics justify it. In Africa where we sold our Tenke Fungurume mine last year, we retained an exploration project that was nearby called Kisanfu. It is we believe the largest undeveloped cobalt deposit in the world. It has been drilled, permitted, and we are considering it either as a stand-alone project or to be built and to process for nearby operations. So, we have this great portfolio. In the Americas, where we currently operate seven open-pit copper mines in the United States, along with two pure molybdenum mines in Colorado, we have two large-scale mines in South America. This is a really high-quality portfolio of assets. They currently have strong operating performance. We sold 674 million pounds of copper in the third quarter. The Cerro Verde concentrator averaged 379,000 tons per day. It's really amazing volume for this concentrator along with Escondida's concentrator. They're the two largest in the world. We're continuing to focus on maintaining our cost position and managing CapEx, but as I mentioned, we're advancing studies for future growth and looking at this opportunity that we have with Cerro Verde in Chile. In the third quarter, we had $719 million of cash flows above CapEx in the Americas alone, and as we look forward, and in the nine months it was over $2 billion. And so, as we look at our business overall for the year we expect to have roughly 3.75 million pounds of copper sales and roughly 2.7 million pounds of that will come from our operations in the Americas outside of Indonesia. So, we've got a great business in Indonesia but if you look at the operation in the Americas beyond Indonesia, you can see a business that has very substantial values in its own right. In the Americas with our Bagdad, our operations in New Mexico, at Chino/Cobre mines, the El Abra operation in Chile, The Lone Star/Safford resource that I'll talk about in Arizona, Morenci, Sierrita, this is a very unique portfolio. It's got 60 million pounds of 2P copper reserves \u2013 60 billion pounds of 2p copper reserves that would be developable at $2 copper. And then if you look at the mineralized material at $2.20 copper, you'd have twice that amount and looking at all of the potential that we have at these mines you get to a very large 266 billion pounds of copper. So, what we have here is a company with very strong current production levels, attractive cost levels, and then built into our portfolio future growth levels. Lone Star, okay. So, Lone Star is a long identified resource that lies adjacent to our Safford mine in Eastern Arizona. It's just across the mountain, 17 miles from Morenci. We have two aspects to this opportunity. The first is a significant oxide project which we are proceeding towards utilizing the development of that oxide resource to use our existing infrastructure at the Safford mine where our oxide resources are being depleted. We've attained the regulatory permits. This has very low execution risk since we we'll just be mining the oxide near-surface resource, transporting it to Safford where we'll use existing processing infrastructure. The estimated production is 200 million pounds a year. Got a 20-year life. The capital costs are estimated at $850 million which essentially for mine equipment and preproduction stripping. Estimated unit cost would be $1.75 a pound. When we begin, it will take about three years to get it in production. It has a $2.40 breakeven price with an 8% return and then a value of $1 billion or more at current copper prices. Now, besides being a good economic project for itself as the oxide resource, if you turn to page 14, you can see this schematic that shows that below the oxide cover, there is a very large potential sulfide. And you can see what our drilling to-date has identified as a defined ore body, but note that we've drilled deeper core holes that continue to find significant mineralization. To date, the resource that we've developed shows a potential for 60 billion pounds of contained copper. And what's happening is is this leach project through the oxides that we'll be processing will serve not only to generate profits by itself, but also serves to strip out the cover material for this sulfide operation and allow us to consider the development of a concentrator mill to take advantage of the chalcocite chalcopyrite sulfide resource that lies underneath the oxide cover, tremendous opportunity. I mentioned El Abra a couple of times. It's a large, high-quality opportunity. The resource estimate is 2 billion pounds of 0.45% copper. Like Cerro Verde, a very large low-grade deposit that can be developed in a low-risk project. We're advancing technical studies. It would involve a 240,000 ton per day concentrator, which is similar to what we did recently at Cerro Verde. The production would be 750 million pounds a year, 68-year lead time including three to four years of feasibility study and permitting followed by construction. We are looking at what we did at Cerro Verde, challenging our team to come up with ways of reducing capital of doing this on a very efficient basis. And we'll be keeping you informed as we go forward with these studies. There's a schematic for this ore body that's on page 13. You can see what to date, the drilling has identified as a mineralized material pit shell, reserve shell, but also note we continue to drill at depth and have positive drill results for mineralization that potentially can extend this ore body. Another great opportunity. So, in Indonesia. At the end of August, after a series of meetings that we've been having during 2017, we, together with the government of Indonesia announced a framework for an agreement to resolve the dispute that we've been discussing for several years with the government. We are seeking and the government of Indonesia is seeking \u2013 and the President was recently quoted on this \u2013 as finding a win-win solution. We've been engaged in discussions on progressing this framework agreement. Both the government and our company are highly motivated to resolve this, to eliminate the uncertainty and bring long-term stability of our operations which is in both parties' interest. In the interim, as you'll see, our operations have been going well, much improved over what we've had in recent times and we're generating good cash flow out of existing operations. The framework agreement would involve converting our existing Contract of Work which was signed in 1991 to a special license in accordance with the Indonesian current mining law. This is called an IUPK. But the IUPK that we are negotiating with the government would provide our subsidiary, PT Freeport Indonesia, with long-term operating rights through 2041 and it would provide certainty of fiscal and legal terms during the term of that IUPK. We have agreed to commit to construct a new smelter in Indonesia within five years of reaching a definitive agreement. This has been an important objective of the government of Indonesia, and we've agreed to meet that objective. We've also agreed to divest to Indonesian participants 51% of the shares of PT-FI. Again, this was a primary objective of the government and we agreed to meet it, conditioned on our Freeport receiving fair market value for the interests that are divested, and that it be structured in a way that we, Freeport, continues to maintain control over operations. This is a complex business, the development of the underground resources at Grasberg are of a scale that's never been done in the industry. It's located in a very remote place, in the highlands of New Guinea, in the province of Papua. Managing the operations, the capital project, environmental issues, the social issues associated with this project are complex. And for us to stay involved, Freeport is insisting that we maintain control of operations. Where we are today is that we're actively engaged in negotiating documentation for this framework. There are complex issues involved in those negotiations, and not all of those have been resolved. But I am convinced that we have a mutual objective of reaching a resolution. The government recently extended our export ability through the end of this year and we are operating under the terms of our contract currently and operating very well, as you can see, in the cash flow chart presented on slide 14. During the third quarter, we generated almost $600 million of operating cash flows compared with $176 million of CapEx and for the nine months this year, it's almost $1.5 billion of operating cash flows and less than $600 million of CapEx. So, this is a great asset for the partnership between the government of Indonesia and our company and we are working hard to preserve that. The future of this company is going to be in the underground where we have had significant operations and have operated since early 1980s. The big underground project that we are currently working on is the Block Cave resource that lies directly beneath the Grasberg open pit. Our plans call for us to complete the pit next year. And from that point forward, all the production would be from the underground. This will \u2013 our current project will allow us to begin block caving this resource in late 2018. We can't begin block caving until the open pit is finished. This will then lead to a ramp up over five or six years to annual production levels of a billion pounds of copper and a million ounces of gold. Truly a world-class operations. The reserves from the Grasberg Block Cave approach a billion tons of copper at a grade exceeding 1% and with significant gold grades of 0.78. So, this is a tremendous physical project and world class in every respect, including the long life, low cost, and economic returns. A schematic of the operations is presented on page 16. You can see the Grasberg open pit. The Block Cave is an extension of the resource we've been mining from the pit to levels that can most economically be mined underground. We're approaching this resource vertically to allow us to have access to it and process it. We have additional resources that are potentially in our future, the Kucing Liar resource that's adjacent to the Grasberg Block Cave; the Big Gossan mine, which is a stoping mine that we've been producing. And then, set apart from the Grasberg complex is an underground resource that we began mining in the early 1980s. We've been continuing to extend this resource at depth, going from the original GBT block cave to the IOZ block cave that we began producing in the 1990s, to the DOZ mine in the 2000s. We started up the DMLZ mine two years ago and it's ramping up. And this will be important supplemental production to the Grasberg Block Cave, which will provide feed for our mill at rates well over 200,000 tons of feed per day, approaching 240,000 tons per day. So, what does this mean for Indonesia? Despite the current controversy and so forth and some of the issues, operationally and with government regulations in recent years, this has been a very positive historical partnership. Freeport began operating there over 50 years ago. Since the new contract in 1991, we've contributed $60 billion to Indonesia's GDP. We're by far the largest private employer in Papua and we're significant economically to the region. We're well over 90% of the GDP of the Mimika province where we operate, Mimika Regency. We're one of the largest tax payers in all of Indonesia. Since we began operating, we've generated significant taxes, royalties and dividends. The government of Indonesia on the existing contract has gotten in excess of 60% of those revenues versus the dividends that have been paid to Freeport. This, by the way, is the most favorable deal with the government of any place we operate in the world and arguably the most favorable of any country in the world. In addition to that, beginning in 1996, to support the local community, we've been contributing 1% of our revenues through a special partnership fund for the local communities and that has accumulated almost $700 million for community health, education and welfare projects. When we look at the current contract, going forward to its end in 2041, future taxes, royalties and dividends at $3 copper, $1,200 gold would exceed $40 billion. This is a major asset for Freeport, but a major asset for the country of Indonesia. And we all recognize that. And we all recognize the best thing for both parties is to reach an amicable resolution, avoid the necessity of our having to try to enforce our rights through arbitration, which is our fallback alternative that neither of us wants to do. And so, we have great incentive to solve it. We just need to continue to work cooperatively to do that and that is our goal. Turning to our outlook, and I mentioned we expect to produce 3.7 billion pounds of copper, 1.6 million ounces, 94 million pounds of molybdenum, this is consistent with our prior outlook. Our site production and delivery costs before byproduct credits at $1,300 gold, $8 molybdenum, would be $1.59. After byproduct credits which are the gold in Grasberg and molybdenum in our Americas business, would be at $1.19, again consistent with previous outlooks, and this would include at $1,300 gold for the fourth quarter net unit costs of less than $1 a pound. At $3 copper, this would generate $4.3 billion of operating cash flows, each $0.10 change in copper means $80 million to us. Our current capital expectations for the year are $1.5 billion including $900 million for major projects, $700 million for the underground development at Grasberg, and $600 million for other mining Again, all this is roughly consistent with prior guidance. So, looking at our sales outlook on slide 19, last year, we had 4.65 billion pounds of copper. That included assets we that sold : the Tenke Fungurume mine in Africa; and an additional interest in our Morenci mine to our partner, Sumitomo, in Arizona. Net of those volumes that were included in this number for last year we'd have been at 4.17 billion. You see our outlook for 2017 is 3.7 billion, 3.9 billion for 2018. The average for the next three years is 3.7 billion. 3.19 billion is a year of transition. It's expected to be below that average, and it would be about 3.5 billion pounds. As we complete mining the open pit, our gold sales will increase 1.6 million this year, 2.4 million next year, and then the three-year average beyond 2018 would be 1.2 million ounces of gold. Now, that would generate at copper prices varying between $3 and $3.50. As you can see on slide 20, $1,300 gold, $8 moly, EBITDA of $6.4 billion. This is an average of 2018-2019 of $6.4 billion to $8.2 billion over that price range and cash flows of $4.4 billion to $5.7 billion. Strong cash flows and to point out 2018 will be higher than this two-year average. You can see our capital expenditure management depicted on slide 21. Last year, it was $2.8 billion including $1.2 billion for our discontinued oil and gas business. This year, it's $1.5 billion, $2.0 billion, $1.8 billion for 2018 and 2019. This includes roughly $800 million a year for our Grasberg underground development. You will see that other minings increases \u2013 has increased, as we were dealing with the financial issues associated with our high debt levels. Following the one gas deal, we really squeezed stay-in-business type capital expenditures, and we've got some catch up to deal with going forward. And you can see that's increased from $600 million by $500 million to $1.1 billion in 2018. Now, a slide that I particularly like to see is how we've been successful in delevering our business. We went in to 2016 with over $20 billion of debt. In our fourth quarter earnings call in January of 2016, when the price of copper was roughly $2 a pound and many experts were projecting it to be, to fall below $2 and stay low for a number of years. We made a \u2013 we set a goal to reduce our debt level by $5 billion to $10 billion over the two years ending at the end of 2017. By the end of 2016 by, through our asset sales and through raising some capital, we have reduced debt to $12 billion at 09/30 it's less than $10 billion. And you can see by the end of 2017, at $3 copper, it would be approximately $9 billion. And we will continue until we make decisions to do otherwise through capital investments or shareholder returns to apply excess cash to reduce debt. And if we meet our plan, which we have confidence in doing and if copper prices average $3 or $3.25, you can see that by the end of 2018, our debt levels would be returned to very low levels. And this, as I said, allows our board to consider disciplined reinvestment opportunities and we look forward to returning this company to a position of paying dividends, returning cash to shareholders. We have a very positive long-term outlook for our business. The thing that has sustained us through the concerning period of time when our debt was so high and markets were weak has been a consistent positive long-term outlook for our business, our assets, our people and the copper markets. And that's what we keep talking with each other about. We have a great morale within our company, great capabilities, great assets. And we are an industry leader in our industry with experienced people, operators and developers. We've got a great long-life geographically diverse portfolio of assets. And now, we're once again financially strong. So, this optimism about our future is nothing but reinforced. So, thank you for your attention. I know you have questions and we look forward to hearing them. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from the line of Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hello, Richard and Kathleen. How are you? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Hey, Mike. We're okay. Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good. Good. A question on Grasberg and the negotiations with Indonesian government. When you guys announced the framework, a lot of the reports coming out from the Indonesian government was that Freeport has agreed to sell down to below 50%. And when you put up the notice and said we're willing to sell down below 50%, obviously, at a fair market value. And there's been reports from the \u2013 quoting people in the government talking about value shouldn't include reserves. And I'm just thinking about valuation parameters to get real value for Freeport. First of all, it's hard enough to come to a conclusion on what copper price to put in when valuing Grasberg. But how do you deal with a situation where, supposedly, the government is thinking about not including the reserves? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, we \u2013 so, the background for that, Mike, is in Indonesia the government owns the resources. Now, that's true with governments around the world. Around the world, governments own the resources and even in the United States, of course, significant resources are on federal and state lands and all the oil resources in the offshore Gulf of Mexico or offshore anywhere are actually owned by the federal government. And governments give operators like Freeport in Indonesia the rights to operate and develop and produce those reserves. And so, any valuation that we are talking to the government about would involve the value of our business today including our rights to develop, operate and produce resources that we have identified through our past exploration and development operations. For example, we have already spent besides the infrastructure that we put in place to enable our operations to continue, in recent years, we've invested $6 billion of capital to develop these underground reserves that will essentially be produced beyond 2021. So, any view of valuation of our business would have to take into account the rights that we have beyond 2021 to 2041. And in our discussions, the government recognizes that. You mentioned copper prices. We had this same issue of dealing with views of copper prices last year and our negotiations with China Molybdenum on Tenke Fungurume and with Sumitomo on Morenci. That was during the first half of 2016 when the world's view of copper prices were decided more pessimistic than they are today. But I think many people were surprised that we were able to, in that environment negotiate deals that were positive for our company in terms of the valuations that we recognized. And we are approaching these negotiations in the same way. Indonesia is a country that has \u2013 it's a democracy now. It has free press. There's opportunities for many people who may be in government or of influence to speak to the press. Often, the comments you see are made by people who are not involved in the negotiations, just like you read comments in the United States on matters and you have to take into account the source of the comments. But I can tell you that we are working positively and amicably with the representatives of the government. At the same time, we are going to be relentless in representing the interest of our shareholders. And so, we're not in a position of where we have to concede to unreasonable positions, and we are not going to do that. Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And assuming you could come to an agreement on value, it would seem that the raw of size of that value to sell to the private sector would be enormous. Would the government buy that position from you directly and then sell it to the private sector over time because it seems like that would be a big chunk to sell to someone in the private sector today? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, there \u2013 we're talking with the government now about not only valuation, but the structure of the process for selling these interests. And that includes the alternative of the Government of Indonesia through potentially a state-owned enterprise of acquiring and holding this interest. There's also under consideration, the provision of a portion of this interest for the province of Papua. The Indonesian economy has grown, Mike, as you know. And there are substantial private business interests here, who have the financial capability of doing large-scale transactions. It's unclear whether all of this would be done to a single buyer. We have suggested to the government that the first step that should be considered in our view, would be an IPO of the interest on the Indonesian Stock Exchange, which has developed into a large liquid marketplace. To-date, there's been reluctance on the government to accept our suggestion. My point is there are a number of alternatives to deal with this issue of the structure and timing of divestment and that's one of the issues that we're having these current meetings about. Michael F. Gambardella - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you very much, Richard. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: All right, Mike. Thanks for the question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO. Please go ahead. David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thanks for taking my questions, and first of all, congrats on hitting the targets this quarter as well. Somewhat related to the previous questions. I did want to ask, just a clarification on the wording of the press release and the commentary in Indonesia. It says the parties continue to negotiate documentation on a comprehensive agreement. And obviously, that goal is to complete the required documentation by 2017. So, I just want to clarify, will that documentation by the end of this year include definitive agreements and definitive plans on things like the structure and the timing of the divestment and the construction of the smelter or is that documentation going to be something else? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: No. The final documentation would address those issues, all of those. It would be a comprehensive conclusion to the issues that we've talked about with the August framework agreement, and we are working with the government to have a complete resolution of those issues. And the current goal that we're both working under is by the end of the year. So, there's an agreement to take future steps like building the smelter, undertaking the divestment, but it would be a comprehensive and final agreement. David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Great. Thank you for clarifying that. And then just somewhat related, can you remind us again, when do the capital spending deferrals/reduction decisions for the underground development, when do those really need to be made? How much of an impact would those have on the 2018 to 2022 mine plan that's been laid out and when would that start to really cut into that mine plan? Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: We have, David \u2013 earlier this year, we have slowed some of the spending \u2013 we cut the spending in the underground by about 25% and you saw the impacts of that earlier this year. We are continuing to spend at a reduced level to prepare the Grasberg Block Cave for startup when the open pit is completed late next year. And, economically, that's what makes the most sense. As you can see from the numbers, the investments that we're making are less than actually the cash flows being generated from the business. So, the business is generating more cash flow than what we're reinvesting currently. But we could make a decision if we reach an impasse to suspend those investments and those would have an impact on our production because the Grasberg Block Cave starts to ramp up during 2019, and as Richard said earlier, if eventually it gets to over a billion pounds of copper a year and over a million ounces of gold. And so that would get pushed out. So, economically, we're incented to continue to make those investments, but we're not going to make them if we reach an impasse and have to go in another direction. But, at this point, our belief is that we'll get this resolved and be able to continue to proceed with our long-term investment plan. David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So, would that effectively tie in to that 2017 year-end timeline? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, it's a continual thing, Dave. In other words, if we run into an impasse, which we don't expect before the end of the year, then we would take those actions. Our goal is and the government is supportive of this goal of getting this resolved by end of the year. If we are continuing to make progress and for whatever reason it's not done then, then we'll assess that circumstance when it comes about. But we've been talking about this so long and I recognize that all you have heard so much about this, but we really see the most positive objective that we've seen by the government in reaching a resolution. And, now, not only do we have a sense of urgency to do that, we're seeing that on the government's side as well. David Francis Gagliano - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. All right. Thanks. That's helpful. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: All right, Dave. Thank you for your question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotia Bank. Please go ahead. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. My question is around Grasberg as well. In the framework where you discuss divesting your ownership down, the PT-FI ownership down, I guess, to 49%, how does that work with the Rio Tinto JV, i.e., with their 40% kicking in, I think, around 2023, does that mean you would drop down to an effective 29% stake starting around 2023? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, just for everybody's information, the project out there and the contract itself is actually a joint venture between us and Rio Tinto. It's a complicated joint venture agreement that was negotiated in the mid-1990s. And under that agreement, Rio Tinto has the right to come in now at roughly, say, 2022 for a 40% joint venture interest. Rio Tinto faces a similar divestiture obligation that PT-FI faces. And PT-FI's interest currently, the government has a 9.36% interest, so PT-FI has roughly over \u2013 FCX has roughly over a 90% interest in PT-FI which would, after Rio Tinto comes in, represent a 90% interest in 60%. And so, after that, if we divest 51%, our interest would be in PT-FI's operations, 49% of 60%. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: 49% of 60%. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: That's where the 29% is coming in. But one thing you should appreciate is the cash flows between now and that timeframe where it dropped to 60%, essentially, close to 100% going to Freeport. So, there's differences between the two interests, and we're generating a substantial amount of free cash flow within that timeframe between now and 2022. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: I see. And with respect to potential funding for the smelter, I don't believe that's in your CapEx guidance moving forward. How much would that add if that smelter was approved, say, for 2018-2019? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: The smelter itself is estimated to be \u2013 if we do it on our own \u2013 a $2.5 billion to $3 billion project. Our intention would be \u2013 and this only gets built after we reach a long term agreement with the government. That's one of the issues that we would be dealing with with the government, and it's not something that we can start developing until the long-term agreement is reached. And so, our framework calls for a five-year period after signing the final agreement. We would structure the ownership interest in the smelter in the way of equity partners contributing equity, and then obtaining financing \u2013 debt financing for a substantial portion of the cost of the capital. So, the amount of capital that would be required to be contributed by PTFI would be reduced by the debt financing that would be negotiated with it and the equity participation of partners. We are in discussions with an Indonesian company called Amman which acquired Newmont's Batu Hijau mine in Indonesia and they have plans to develop a smelter and we are in discussions with them about potentially doing a joint venture project for a larger smelter with them, and in that case, they would be a partner in the project as would we and we would have a copper concentrate supply agreement with them, that would have to be appropriately structured. So, there's a number of moving parts here with how we proceed with the smelter project. Including the size, the location, the potential partnership with Amman that all would be triggered by the completion of our negotiation on the global contract resolution. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Okay. But on a kind of high level basis, if you're divesting your ownership stake and then Rio Tinto's got a 40% JV, is it conceptually correct that Freeport might only have to fund 29% of the total CapEx, like excluding any \u2013 where the funding is coming from? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, it would be PT-FI would be funding it. And if you look through PT-FI to Freeport's net interest in that, you're correct. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Now, one of the conditions that we are \u2013 as part of the global agreement that this is another current point of discussion is while we've agreed to divest 51%, our position is, is that we maintain control over operations and the company. And so, even though we would only own 49%, with that control, we expect that we would continue to consolidate PT-FI in our financial statements. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: I see. Thank you very much. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Hi, everybody. Excuse me. Just on \u2013 getting back to that Rio situation relative to Grasberg. I mean, like, the way that I thought about it was that there's a certain net present value that can be attributed to \u2013 for Grasberg that can be attributed to Freeport and a certain net present value of the mine that can be attributed to Rio based on the cash flows that each entity would be receiving during the years in which Freeport owns 90.6% and Rio \u2013 and then during the years in which Freeport has, what, the 50%, whatever percent, based on the current structure. And so, then, like, therefore, if there were a divestiture under the current scenario that it could end up such that Freeport would end up having, at the end of the day, still more than that 30% because, currently, the way that I calculate it is that the net present value of Grasberg is something like 65% to Freeport currently and 35% to Rio. So that if there were \u2013 if there were a divesture now of a certain portion of the value to Indonesian entities that it wouldn't be like if \u2013 that Rio wouldn't get 40% of your 50% kind of thing. You know what I mean? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: No no no. Yeah. First of all, we would not agree with your PV analysis. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Okay. But we're not in a position to disclose that, but I'm just going to comment on that. So, all I'll tell you to do is think again. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And then, you have one contract where you have currently two assignees of interest in that contract. Rio Tinto has an assignment and PT-FI has an interest. We are negotiating on behalf of PT-FI and the Indonesians, as part of our deal, we're agreeing to a divestment. The Indonesians will also be looking at Rio Tinto's interest and expecting a divestment of that interest. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And so, while there is 60/40 beyond 2022, as Kathleen said, and it will depend on copper prices and so forth, but there's substantial values between now and 2022 that'll be going to PT-FI that will not be going to Rio Tinto. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Right. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Rio Tinto has some obligations to contribute capital. They will get some dividends going forward. But the bulk of the dividends would be coming to PT-FI. So, the relative values are affected particularly when you look at the present value calculation. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Yeah. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: By the fact that near-term cash flows are going to PT-FI, longer term, Rio Tinto comes in for a 40% interest, but that's subject to divestiture as well. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Right. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: I will tell you this, Rio Tinto has the right, under our joint venture agreement, of approval for any changes we make to the contract. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Right. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: We've had an extraordinary positive relationship with Rio Tinto. They've been great partners. We feel an obligation to be good partners to them, and this has been going on now for 20 years. And we will work together to achieve the mutual goal of building values in this asset that would benefit both parties. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Right. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: It's not a question of competing interest with us versus Rio Tinto. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay. So, right. So, it's not \u2013 so, again, I mean, I guess I was thinking about it wrong in that after 2022, the way that you understand it now is that Freeport will own that 29%. But before or through 2022, Freeport will have, under the current scenario, 90.6% of the cash flows from Grasberg. But after this agreement, will have \u2013 like after this agreement is struck, will have only 49% after its... Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, as I mentioned, one of the matters under discussion... Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Yeah. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: ...is the process and timing for divestitures. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: We're not talking about a divestiture at one point in time, but a series of steps towards that. And we have not yet agreed on that, but it's not likely that you would expect Freeport to retain 90% through 2022. But it's also likely that there would be steps taken along the way to work towards that goal. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay. All right. Okay. Thanks. And then, a quick question is in terms of the ability to IPO a portion of Grasberg on the Indonesian Stock Exchange, how much do you think you could \u2013 how much liquidity could the market bear at this point do you think, of Grasberg stock? So, could there be a $1 billion issuance, do you think, or... Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yes. The exchange has had offerings of that size and slightly more. We were suggesting perhaps a 10% float of an IPO. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And that would be an amount that would be in excess of $1 billion. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: There's one more point that I think is important to build into your analysis, is that as we divest, we are going to be receiving fair market value for the divested interest. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Right. Right. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And so, while our interest in the participation in Grasberg would be reduced, we would be receiving cash from that interest, which would reduce our exposure to Indonesia. There's positives and negatives to that. But it would provide cash for us to supplement achievement of our financial goals for the rest of our business. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Yeah. That's the idea right, getting the full value or the fair value of the full value is what you've been talking about. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Exactly. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Company: Okay, great. Well, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC : Hey. Good morning, Richard, Kathleen. Thanks for taking my call. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Hey Chris. Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC : It seems like the biggest issue regarding Indonesia is just the bid/ask spread around the majority stake. And back in early 2016, you had said that you valued all of PT-FI at something slightly above $16 billion. There were some reports at the time that Indonesia had said that it was worth about $6.5 billion. I think you had said that that was never a formal response from Indonesia. And in fact, as far as I know, you've not gotten a formal offer from them yet. Recently though, the Mining Minister of Indonesia said that based on Grasberg being 40% of your profits and based on your $20 billion market cap, that would imply that your ownership stake in Grasberg is worth about $8 billion. And there were some reports as well that he said, we understand that to buy a majority stake, we'd have to pay some premium to that. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Okay, well, Chris... Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC : Is that not accurate \u2013 that's just some reports from Indonesia. Just want to get the facts. (1:08:16) Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: The press report was accurate. But think about this, and I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with Grasberg being 40% of Freeport's assets. That's just \u2013 that's what he said. But you wouldn't apply the 40% to the equity value. It would be to the enterprise value. So, besides the $20-plus billion of equity value now, we have $10 billion of debt. And so... Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC : Yeah. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: ...that 40% would be applied to $30-plus billion. And that represents 90% of PT-FI because the government owns 9.36%. Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC : Right. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So, you'd have to gross it up for that 10% to get a number that would be comparable to our $16 billion number. Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC : Right. So, your $16 billion is for 100% of PT-FI. Their $8 billion for the 90-plus percent stake, implies $8.8 billion for 100%. Regardless of how they got to that number, I guess... Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, before you say that, just remember, that if you're talking about the percent of an asset to an enterprise, it's not logical to look at the equity market value, you need to look at the enterprise market value. So, with the equity plus debt, so it would be $30-plus billion. And following that analysis, you would say 40% of $30-plus billion is over $12 billion, that's 90%. So, you need to gross that up to 100%. So, you'd get to something over $13 billion. Now, I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with that analysis, but I'm just saying to be a logical analysis, that's the process you'd have to go through. Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC : But I guess my point is that... Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So, the difference between those two is not as great as the press accounts would have shown. Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC : Right. But I guess my question is, regardless of how we got to that number, the point is, he did say $8 billion for the 90-plus percent stake. And then, I think he also said that some premium for a majority ownership might be required. The question really comes down to whether or not that offer is on the table to Freeport. Is that something that they've presented to you? And then... Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: No. No. And in fact \u2013 well, let's see, now I've got it. That's not what the government would say today... Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC : Yeah. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: ...even in talking about it. I mean, they recognized what I've just said about the different in equity value and enterprise value. But we are working with the government. They have indicated fair market value is the right standard, and now we've got to negotiate what that fair market value is just as we had to negotiate with China Moly and with Sumitomo and with others who were trying to look at buying our assets. So, we've had a lot of experience with this. They're going to get expert financial advice, and we will sit down and find out \u2013 and determine what's a fair value. Again, we believe the best way to do it is to allow us to do an IPO on the exchange. And that way, the market determines it. They so far have been reluctant to do that. So, we will engage in these discussions but it will be on a rational basis for coming up with a fair market value. Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC : Do you think that the $16 billion estimate that you've provided in January or February 2016 is a stale number now that copper markets have improved, and you've invested more in the asset. In other words, in your mind, is $16 billion too low now? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, the $16 billion number, just like in our 2016 transaction, was not a number that was based on the then-existing copper price. It was based on what people like Wood Mackenzie, sell-side guys like yourself what your outlook for copper prices were. So since that time, we have updated that valuation. It's part of private discussions with the government. You'd have to take into account we've produced a year-and-a-half of those values in our current operations and received cash for it. We've had some adjustments to our mine plans and the copper prices are what they are. So, we're at a number but in terms of what you're perceiving to be significantly higher, there are some things going in the other direction that affect that number as well. Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC : And I'm sorry, just one last quick one for me. So, let's assume that an IPO is ultimately not an option, therefore, it's about a negotiation and the bid/ask spread, it never closes. In other words, you can never come to an agreement. Would Freeport, and this might be too hypothetical to answer, but would Freeport be willing to accept an offer that is below what you deem to be fair market value in order to avoid the potential lose-lose scenario of arbitration. In other words, is there an opportunity cost to not getting it done even if you accept a price lower than you'd like. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Now, Chris, if you were in my shoes, would you answer that question? Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC : No. Hypothetical, sorry. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So, I'm not going to answer the question. And I'll also point out that the $16 billion number that we disclosed there was 100%, we own 90% of that value. Because the government already owns 9.36%. Okay. That's just a fact. Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC : Thank you for that. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS. Please go ahead. Andreas Bokkenheuser - UBS Securities LLC : Actually, all of my questions were answered. So, thank you very much. Appreciate the clarity. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Okay, Andrew (sic) [Andreas], thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Lucas Pipes with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Yes. Good morning, everybody. So, Richard, you drew a couple of parallels to negotiations that took place in 2016 which were all market-driven, in my opinion. So, would you say you have agreed with the government of Indonesia on the set of assumptions that go into fair market value? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Not yet. I mean, we've agreed on a concept of fair market value, but that's been part of the process of getting to where we are now. And so, the next stage is to deal with those parameters. Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Got it. That's helpful. And then, here we are kind of at the midpoint between the framework agreement in late August and the end of year. And what progress would you say has been made since the announcement of the framework agreement? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Let's see. Kathleen is going to kick me, but not as much as I'd hoped for. But I think the clarity of the government's desire, and sense of urgency for reaching a deal has \u2013 that was my hope when we announced the framework, and I think that is coming into play. We've made a good bit of progress on \u2013 and all of these things are incredibly complex, but we've made a good bit of progress on fixing the financial and the fiscal and legal terms for the extension. We're still having discussions on the form of that. We are working to get that documented in a contractual agreement between us and the government that gives us the ability to defend that and not be subject to future changes in laws and regulations. So, that's the place where we've made the most specific progress. We still have to firm up the form of that. But the big issues on divestment, the valuation issue we've made progress in dealing with this issue that was raised earlier about not considering reserves, I think Mike Gambardella raised in the first question the issue about whether it's to 2021 to 2041. All of those things we've made progress with the teams we're taking to with Indonesia. Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe a follow-up on the Rio point. So, if the Government of Indonesia were to buy Rio's stake hypothetically, would that satisfy your portion of the local ownership rules? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, there's kind of two aspects to that. I mean, there is a possibility that Rio could stay involved. In other words, they could continue to own 49% of their interest. They publicly commented on questioning whether they would do that or not and if they do decide to exit we would work with them to achieve their objectives and then work with the government to see how that would fit in to our overall divestment situation. Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Got it. Great. And then. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: I can't say more than that but that's part of the discussions. Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: And then I have a quick operational question as well. Last quarter, you mentioned some seismic activity in the DMLZ zone and I don't think it was mentioned at all this time, could you give us a quick update on where that stands? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Sure. We did alter our plans last quarter, as we mentioned, and this is one of the things, going back to Chris's question, about how this affects value. But we altered our plans and the effect of which was to slow down some of the near-term production in the Deep MLZ. And we have followed those plans, feel good about the progress we're making in terms of the plans and the ultimate resolution of that. But the reason is not highlighted in our report is that we've operated according to plan that we set out going into third quarter. And Mark Johnson, you're on the call. I think that summarized it but if you have anything to add, feel free to. Hey, Mark. Are you there? Operator : Mark's line is on mute. Mark, could you unmute your phone? Okay. I opened your line. Mark Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Okay. Yes. Richard, you're right. After the June event in Deep MLZ, we came out with a revised plan that had two months of undercutting, a focus on the undercutting. We're nearing the end of that undercutting activity. The mine's performed well. We haven't had any unexpected seismic activity. We expect in mid-November after we continue to assess the situation that we would initiate a period of production. So we're feeling confident that the changes that we made to the plan, that the mine's reacting well, and we're on schedule. Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: All right. Great. Well, thank you, everybody, and good luck. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thanks a lot. Appreciate that. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead. Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, Richard and Kathleen and thanks for taking the time to do the call from Indonesia. Just a quick follow-up on Grasberg. I think at some point we had seen a local media article that had suggested that Freeport might give up the right to international arbitration as part of the new framework. That seems very unlikely given your previous very clear comments on that issue. But could you just quickly comment on that? Thank you. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: No. That's part of our position when we use the term legal certainty in talking about the extension with fiscal and legal certainty that means defining taxes royalty in fiscal terms and legal enforceability which would include international arbitration. Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then just turning elsewhere, with copper back above $3 a pound, is there any \u2013 been given any consideration to resuming full mining rates at El Abra and what would be the cost of doing that? Thanks. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, at El Abra, it's really not really a significant cost in doing it. I mean, we have reduced mining rates, so there would be some incremental cost, but it's not significant. What's really factoring into that is the planning we're doing about the major project and when that might be commenced. We haven't \u2013 as I keep emphasizing, we haven't made that decision. We have a lot of work to do before we do that. But part of the mine rate decision is more coordinating that with the potential commencement of the major expansion project. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And, Alex, as you remember, we had cut back production at El Abra and also at Sierrita. We've been gradually bringing some of that back on and again doing it in a manner that would allow us to continue to preserve our operating cost position. And, also, part of the reason why we cut back was to defer capital spending. So, we are bringing some of it back on line, but we're doing it in a very careful manner so that we don't alter in any significant way our cost structure or capital spending plans. Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then, just very quick on Cerro Verde. If I remember right, Cerro Verde hasn't been paying a dividend to its shareholders for a while, given the expansion and the spending there. Is there any timing on when Cerro Verde is expected to resume paying cash dividends to shareholders? Thanks. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: That is under consideration. As you've seen, you know we did complete the expansion and we refinanced the loan at the Cerro Verde level, which allowed us to repay shareholder loans that were made from the shareholders to advance into Cerro Verde to fund some of that project. And so, we do believe we will be in a position to resume dividends at Cerro Verde, and that's under consideration as we review the outlook, you've probably seen in the press release the royalty matter which has created some uncertainty in terms of the timing of when any payments would have to be made in connection with that. But even after the royalty matter, we do believe we'll have flexibility to resume dividend payments at Cerro Verde. And so, we're currently assessing the timeframe and the extent of those dividends. Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And just on the royalty, I think in the slides, you said you paid $135 million so far. Is that against the total amount or against your net amount? Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: That's of the gross amount. So, that's the amount at Cerro Verde that's been paid. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And that's an accrual. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: But we have been paying \u2013 we've paid $135 million under the installment method towards that. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Okay. Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, Kathleen and Richard. Thank you again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : Hi. I'm thinking about dividends as I ask the question. In terms of the Kisanfu exploration project, the Serbian deep stuff, smelter in Indonesia, the heap leach at Lone Star, the sulfide mill at Lone Star or the sulfide mill at El Abra. Are all of those things likely to be 2020 or later outlays that really don't influence the decision as to how much of a dividend to pay in 2018? And could you just talk to the question of dividends. Happy days are here again. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, the answer is yes to your first question. Those are 2020 projects and beyond. The big issue on dividends rest with our success in reaching a resolution on this Indonesian question. And so, as we go forward, with success on that and with copper to markets which we believe will be positive, we'll be looking at debt levels with potential for capital spending. And we will be, what can I say, I'm confident our board will be very positive about paying dividends when the stars align. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : So, the bond rating agencies might be, in a way, pleased if a quarter or two is going to go where you just put all the cash to reducing debt while you're settling those affairs. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, I can tell you that the bond rating agencies are extraordinarily pleased with what we've done over the past almost two years now and in seeing where we are and the cash we're generating. And like you say, if we continue to reduce cash, we get Indonesia settled, we will be in good shape with the rating agencies even with beginning to pay a dividend. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : Thank you very much. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Okay, John. Thanks for your question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, Richard and Kathleen. A couple of questions from me. Just in terms of the export license that you've renewed until the end of 2017. Just curious on that, normally it's a six-month renewal, I think going back over the last couple of years. Was that your call or the government's call to try to just lock that in, and I assume that's to try to push the agenda along on settling this dispute. Is that how we rate it or how did that come about? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: That's exactly right, and it was a mutual decision. Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay. And then, you've touched on the Grasberg CapEx what you're spending now and then going forward only a couple of questions earlier. And it doesn't look like you've changed the guidance at all for that. But based on the 2Q presentation and the 3Q, there's a small adjustment down in 2019. It's only minor from 0.8 billion pounds down to 0.7 billion. Is that just around the edges or has there been any change, I guess, in the last three months to what you're actually spending on the underground or it is still like Kathleen said, about 25% down on the start of the year what you're expecting? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, we go through a process every quarter. We don't \u2013 here at Freeport, we don't have an annual planning process. We have a detailed review of capital allocation, capital spending every quarter. We meet with all of our mine managers and review results and outlooks. And we challenge people on capital spending, and we defer wherever we can. So, particularly in Indonesia, we want to \u2013 we're making efforts to reduce capital spending to the maximum level we can while achieving our objectives of moving forward these projects so that we could begin caving at the end of next year. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: But the production change you're talking about is just that. It's around the edges, rounding numbers change in 2019 and over the five-year period, there really wasn't a significant change in the overall copper or gold production or a significant change in spending. Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah. Understood. I recognize that moves around a little bit quarter-to-quarter and I think it's done that in the past. So, I was just trying to check whether the last, say, three months anything has moved on the underground. And then the last question I had just on Lone Star, the $850 million CapEx, do we think about that as being mainly spent in 2019, 2020 or into 2021 or what's the profile on that? Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well it depends on when we start it. But it's roughly three-plus years. And the bulk of it is for mining equipment and to start the pre-production and stripping. But you could spend roughly $800 million of the total in 2018, 2019, and 2020 ratably if we were to move forward in the next several months, but it's still under consideration at this point. Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's all for me. Thanks. Thanks, Kathleen, and thanks, Richard. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera with CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead. Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Hi, guys. Just in terms of the capital spend that you are deciding, whether Grasberg gets resolved or not, and it's good to see that there's other projects that could surface value within the company. Kathleen just mentioned 2018, 2019, and 2020 for CapEx in Lone Star, is that based on a go ahead or not go ahead decision in Grasberg? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: No. No. We're at the point now with our improvement in our debt levels in our balance sheet, that that's an independent decision. So, going forward on Lone Star is not dependent on having success with Grasberg. Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then \u2013 I'm sorry. Go ahead. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: No. I was just going to say it fits in with the timing of the declines in the Safford and how to best maximize the NPV of the project in connection with the expected production at Safford because what we're doing really is leveraging the existing infrastructure. And so, as long as that infrastructure is being used for already developed reserves, we're better off deferring the spending at Lone Star. But we're getting to the point now \u2013 and we've gotten the permits, et cetera. We're going to the point now where we can see line of sight in terms of when those two intersections will cross. And so, we are going to be considering with our board the timing of that project. Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: According to your 10-K the life in Safford ends in 2024, so you're saying that the new or the greater Lone Star are better than what you're currently mining? Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah. And it ends in 2024, but it has a \u2013 it will start falling off before then. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah. The oxides at Safford are nearing the end of their lives. This would be a whole different project if you had to build all these processing facilities and infrastructure to produce those reserves. But when you have those available to you with excess capacity to deal with it, that's what makes it so attractive. And for 200 million pounds of copper a year, with that kind of cost structure, the payback for this investment is pretty quick. Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Yeah. And I think I'm going to manage to ask another question without asking about Indonesia. So, on El Abra, you are holding a six to eight year of expected lead time. If a new government gets elected in Chile, do you think you can accelerate that process? And if so, Codelco has quoted $40 billion in expenditures over the next eight years? I'm assuming El Abra is not part of that. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: No. El Abra is not part of Codelco's capital spending there. I think most of you know, they are our 49% partner, but that would be funded within the company itself. The government issue I don't believe will have an impact on the process. While there may be a potentially more favorable outlook for the industry \u2013 like around the world, in Chile environmental concerns are significant and widely held. And so, I believe we'd go through the same permitting process regardless of the government. And this is a project, being a brownfield expansion in this mining region near Anapagasa (01:36:15), it's the kind of project that Chile will welcome regardless of the government. And regardless of the government, they would want to make sure that the planning and environmental management is handled in the right way. Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much and good luck with the approach in Indonesia. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thanks, Oscar. Good to hear your voice. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Brian MacArthur - Raymond James Ltd.: Good morning. I hate to go back to Indonesia again, but just one of the points you make all the time is how much benefits the government gets out of this. And on the slide, you talked about $40 billion through to 2041, and I'm just \u2013 there's been talk about changing taxes in Indonesia as part of this or whatever. I was just curious to the extent you can what you actually assume to get to $40 billion. Did you assume the current structure going forward? Is that your share? Does that include Rio, or what actually went in that? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: That's total for the project, and it includes the current contract tax and royalty provision. We \u2013 as part of our agreement, we are \u2013 we've agreed to increase royalties to the royalty levels that are currently applicable under the new mining law. And then, we're working on new fiscal terms so that the fiscal burden on our business would be equivalent to what it has been under the cap. Brian MacArthur - Raymond James Ltd.: Okay great. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So, the government would be receiving more benefits which has been one of their objectives. Those incremental benefits would come from higher royalties, but we're working together to reshuffle the cards somewhat on the taxes and other fees. But the objective would be that the burden for our business would be equivalent to what it has been. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And Brian, we've been paying the higher royalties since 2014. You'll remember that our royalty rates... Brian MacArthur - Raymond James Ltd.: Yeah. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: ...we're paying more than what's under our CAL today. So, we're not anticipating a material change in the aggregate of our fiscal terms. Brian MacArthur - Raymond James Ltd.: Right. And I assume \u2013 but you assume through to 2022, you sort of worked under the strip and everything the same and then switch to 60-40 there and spending, I mean, roughly, are you just going to kind of make it work it out, so it's neutral? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah. Well, the way it works now is PT-FI pays its taxes, Rio Tinto pays its taxes... Brian MacArthur - Raymond James Ltd.: Right. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: ...for this joint venture. So, I mean \u2013 you know this, but to remind everybody else, we have a 35% income tax rate, whereas the general tax rate in Indonesia is 25% and they're talking about potentially reducing it. We also pay a 10% withholding tax for dividends that are paid from Indonesia to FCX. So, there's a very substantial tax burden already in place on us which, as I said, is the highest of any country that we operate in. Brian MacArthur - Raymond James Ltd.: Great. Thanks very much, Richard. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: All right. Good to hear your voice, too. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with Virtual (sic) [Vertical] Research. Please go ahead. Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: That would be Vertical, and I'm sorry I have to \u2013 no Indonesia question here. Just interested, Richard, your thoughts on early part of the cycle. Are you getting some interesting (1:39:48) pressures from your vendors, equipment, labor, contractors? Is that something you've been able to push back? Or is that something we're going to see as we move forward as the cycle strengthens? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, it's just natural that you go from a period of very low levels of activities with vendors to an increased level. There is going to be a price impact with that. We are such a large customer with our vendors that we have a partnership with them, and so we work together to get to fair deals with them. But I see some of the analysts already commenting on some cost increases in the industry, and obviously as prices rise you can expect costs to rise. There is a correlation. One of the reasons we've never been attracted to hedging is there is a correlation between copper prices and many of our input costs. And so, that's just \u2013 that correlation is going to continue. Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.: I appreciate that. Thanks, Richard. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Then I will just complement, Red, Mark, Mike and their teams for the job that they do to find efficiencies in everything from truck usage to tires to engines, and we've done studies. We've had to do that because we got these low grade mines and our guys have done a great team. We've benchmarked our operations against other mining operations around the world. And when they show that to me, I get very proud of our team. They're just doing a great job. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Novid Rassouli with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Novid Rassouli - Cowen & Co. LLC: Hi, Richard and Kathleen. Thank you for all the color thus far. I was wondering if you could give your thoughts on the potential Chinese scrap import ban and if that is affecting or if you guys are seeing that affecting Chinese domestic buying behavior at all? Or any thoughts surrounding that would be greatly helpful. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, there's so many moving parts in China today with the issues related to scrap, with their focus on environmental management with \u2013 they are taking steps to deal with inefficiencies in their industry, and that carries over to the copper-processing industry. And then, their efforts to continue to stimulate their economy and build infrastructures, and now with the One Belt One Road initiative to devote spending to infrastructure development in other countries. You add all of that up and what you see in China is growth at a much lower absolute level of growth than in the past. But with the size of their economy which, by many measures, it's the largest economy in the world now and even lower growth with absolute levels, you end up with very significant amounts of copper demand. But what's happening too in our industry is whereas China, for many years, was the source of all the growth, today, growth from year-to-year is now coming from outside China with the recovery of economies in Europe and in the United States. Perhaps half of the growth now is coming from countries outside of China. And so, that's what is fundamentally good about our business. We're so correlated to general economic levels in developed countries. And then, when you have countries like China and other developing countries that are spending money, it creates good demand. I was counting today the building cranes outside my window near the hotel in Jakarta, and I counted 18 high-rise building cranes going up. And that's just one instance of growth in a Southeastern Asia economy and the demand for copper that that creates. Novid Rassouli - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. And then just one follow-up. Going back to slide 22 with respect to leverage, I just wanted to see longer term, what's your goal or what do you have in mind for maybe a long-term average kind of debt-to-EBITDA level that you'd be comfortable with, just so we can get a sense of kind of how things could trend and what type of bandwidth you might have for future investments? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So, we've never managed our business to have any kind of target of debt-to-EBITDA. We do a series of long-term forward cash flow analysis using different scenarios of copper prices and then we match capital spending to go with that and we manage our debt levels to be comfortable with that. I mean, we're at a debt level now that we would be comfortable with, living with for the long term. But because we're not prepared to commit to long-term capital right now and we have this overhang of the Indonesian situation, we're going to be using cash flows to continue to reduce debt. You may recall that in 2011, at the time we announced the oil and gas deal, our company had zero debt. And we were paying substantial dividends. So, we don't have a targeted debt level. It's all based on cash flow analysis and we'll continue to run it on that basis and make disciplined decisions about investing capital when that's warranted. Novid Rassouli - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks, Richard. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for your question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Piyush Sood with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Piyush Sood - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, Richard and Kathleen. Thanks for taking the question. First one, just want to understand the optionality you have at Grasberg, where you could advance mining of some higher grades in 2018 and 2019. So, can you give us some idea on what's the upside there? And if that could keep the open pit running longer than expected? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, we are going after the highest grades available and all of that is a function of the pit design. We're at the very bottom of this pit right now, and so Mark and his team are constantly looking for opportunities to get the highest grade available consistent with maintaining the integrity of the pit and the safety of the slopes. So, there's not a question of having opportunities to high grade. We're going after the very highest grade that we have. Now, we are \u2013 as we get to the bottom of this pit, we're looking for opportunities to maximize PV and that's an ongoing mine planning exercise. And so, that may well be that we can find some opportunities for temporarily extending the pit, but that's just going to be something at the margin. We are \u2013 and that would be a trade-off for what we could get through the pit and how much we could get from committing the block caving underground because to the extent we defer that then you're deferring the ramp-up, and so. But it's strictly a safety first exercise and then maximizing NPV for deciding where to access the ore. Piyush Sood - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And that's helpful. And switching gears to El Abra and I realize the project is in its early days. The technical study is a few years out. But just want to check if that's an operation for the world where copper is at $3 or is it maybe a project for a $3.50 or a $4 copper world? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: It's more in the range of $3. It's not a $4 project. No. We have reserves at $2, but we're not \u2013 we wouldn't run the mine plan on that, but it would require confidence that you got a $3 copper price to proceed with it. Piyush Sood - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, Richard. Thanks for the color. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And by the way, that's the industry we live in. I mean, we always look over all these analyst reports before our earnings call. I mean, Wood Mackenzie's long-term incentive price for copper is $3.30. That's just what it is. I'm not commenting on it one way or another other than saying that's what their analysis shows for the industry as a whole. Piyush Sood - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Now, we'll turn the call over to management for any closing remarks. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, those were good questions. Not unexpected questions, I would say. But we appreciate your participation, your good questions. We look forward to reporting our progress as we go forward. If you have any follow-up issues you'd like to get clarification on, please contact David Joint and he will arrange for us to respond to any questions or comments that you might have. So, thanks, everyone. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you and good morning, and welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today\u2019s call are available on our website. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet. Anyone may listen to the conference call by accessing our website homepage at fcx.com and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today\u2019s call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. On the call today are Richard Adkerson, our Chief Executive Officer. We have also have Red Conger here, Mark Johnson, and Mike Kendrick. I\u2019ll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be reviewing our performance and the slide presentation that included on our website. After the prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions. Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $1 billion, or $0.71 per share. The results include net gains of $291 million, or $0.20 per share, primarily related to tax benefits associated with U.S. tax reform totaling $393 million, partly offset by charges for adjustments to environmental obligations. The benefit from tax reform principally relates to the appeal of the AMT and a refund of our AMT credit carry-forward. After adjusting for these net charges, the fourth quarter 2017 adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $750 million, or $0.51 per share. For the year, our net income attributable to common stock totaled $1.8 billion, or $1.25 per share, compared to a net loss attributable to common stock of $4.2 billion, or $3.16 per share for the year 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2017, our adjusted earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization or EBITDA totaled $2.1 billion and $6 billion for the full-year. A reconciliation of our EBITDA calculation is available in our slide materials on Page 37. For the fourth quarter, FCX totaled 1 billion pounds of copper, 593,000 ounces of gold, and 24 million pounds of molybdenum. And for the full-year, we sold 3.7 billion pounds of copper, 1.6 million ounces of gold, and 95 million pounds of molybdenum. Our fourth quarter average realized copper price of $3.21 per pound was 29% above the year-ago quarter average price of $2.48 per pound. Our average unit net cash costs for copper was $1.04 per pound for the fourth quarter of 2017 and averaged $1.20 per pound for the full-year and that compared to $1.26 per pound for the full-year of 2016. We generated strong operating cash flows in the fourth quarter totaling $1.7 billion, which exceeded our capital expenditures of $390 million. For the full-year, our operating cash flow totaled $4.7 billion and capital expenditures for $1.4 billion. We used our strong cash flows to improve our balance sheet. During the fourth quarter, we repaid $1.7 billion in debt and that include \u2013 included the early redemption of $617 million of senior notes due 2020 and open-market repurchases of $74 million of notes due in 2018. At the end of 2017, our consolidated cash was $4.4 billion and consolidated debt totaled $13.1 billion. Our debt net of cash of $8.7 billion at the end of 2017 was $3.1 billion less than at the start of the year and $11.4 billion less than the level two years ago. We ended the year with no borrowings under our bank credit facility and approximately 300 \u2013 $3.5 billion available. I would now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be providing additional details on our results and our outlook. Richard Adkerson : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. 2017 results reflect really strong operating performance throughout our global operations, as Kathleen just described. It also reflects the success of our ongoing cost management and capital discipline efforts, strong cash flow generation, we restored our balance sheet strength, developed attractive organic growth options for the future, and we made important and positive progress for the long-term stability of our operations in Indonesia. Most of you have been here and watched our company for sometime, just think about where we were two years ago. We had just lived through as the industry had significant drops in commodity prices. The price of copper was just over $2 a pound. Many expected to drop below that. We had the issue of having $20 billion of debt following the misplaced oil and gas transaction that we did. We had restructured our Board, restructured our management team and were faced with deleveraging. At that Board call, one of you pressed us to say what do you expect your debt levels to be. We weren\u2019t sure at that time. We said, we hope to reduce our debt between $5 billion and $10 billion over the next two years. We are under $9 billion as we ended the year, this year. We were faced with the completion of our Cerro Verde project in Peru, which was a major project, which often are troublesome for the industry. We did not know what we\u2019re going to do with the oil and gas assets that time. There were no buyers in the marketplace in the first quarter, but we successfully exited that business. We thought we were going to have to hold all those assets for a period of time. Many who followed our company were skeptical of our ability to sell copper assets at reasonable prices and we\u2019re working with our partners, Sumitomo with \u2013 and Morenci, with China Moly, which turned out to be a great partner to deal within the Congo. We were able to get reasonable values at the time, great investments for those companies, because they recognize the long-term values and the values in the copper marketplace. We had to sell some equity, but we fought our way through that a year ago. In October 2016, I went back and looked at my notes from LME work. There was still people predicting a wall of copper supply, still predicting copper prices in October 2016 of $1.80 a pound. The price on the upside that we were above $2.50 a year ago, but we were blindsided by new regulations that it come out from the government of Indonesia that affected \u2013 raised questions about our contract there. They came out in January. Since that time, I\u2019ve spent as much time in Jakarta as I haven\u2019t been. Kathleen has been there on my last five trips. And we were pleased that after facing the prospects of very contentious arbitration proceeding, which we talked about publicly in the first quarter, we have reached a common grounds for moving forward with the government of Indonesia. We now mutually want to get this thing solved. We made a lot of progress now, give you a report on where we stand and answer your questions. But 2017, price of copper came back. So today, we have a company that has really great set of long-lived attractively cost \u2013 operating cost profile, assets and resources. I\u2019m so proud of our team. I have Red Conger here, who runs our business in the Americas; Mark Johnson, who runs our business in the Indonesia; Mike Kendrick, who runs our Molydenum business; Rick Coleman, who does our construction projects, who\u2019s traveling. But these guys and their teams just had an exceptional year this year and executing our plan and being focused on doing that, while we\u2019ve dealt with the issues associated over the last two years with balance sheet management dealing with Indonesia. We\u2019ve got a great team. And this team has executed extraordinarily well. You can go back to the early 2000s when we had to deal with a serious balance sheet issue. The successful integration and that repayment following the Phelps Dodge deal in 2007, where we successfully repaid all the debt that highly leveraged transactions within four years after managing ourselves through the financial crisis of 2008, 2009. By 2011, we had a company with no debt, had an integrated team that is the best copper operating team in the industry. Metrics are shown on Page 11 \u2013 on Page #4 \u2013 Page 4. So the key thing it jumps out is free cash flow generation here in 2017. First part of 2017 was tough in Indonesia. We were restricted on exports for a period of time. We had significant labor problems by midyear. We were exporting and continue to export, expect to be able to continue to export. Our labor relations issues have been really progressed. New union leadership in Indonesia, we signed a new two-year labor contract in December without any controversy or drama associated with it. But even with that issues at the start of the year, we generated over $3 billion of operating cash flows in excess of our capital expenditures. You can see our cost structure. We maintained our reserves. And as I mentioned, we have really reduced our balance sheet. As we look forward to our plan for next year, if copper prices remain at roughly the current levels, the debt level, when I say, next year, this year 2018, we should end the year if we use all of our cash flows to reduce debt at a debt level in the area of $5 billion. So $20 billion to $5 billion is a great progress. Copper market commentary is positive right now, as we\u2019ve seen. Demand is growing throughout the world. For a number of years, many years, China was the source \u2013 sole source of growth globally. The day China is continuing to grow, their economy is better than people expected, as you\u2019ve seen. They appear to have dealt with their banking issues that was a big concern, probably still a risk, but growth in Europe, growth in the United States, growth in Japan just tune into the comments at Davos that\u2019s going on right now. And you can hear the positive comments about the global economy and all that reflects into stronger copper demand. Supply side, the issues are still there. Analysts, consultants who follow this business are expecting 2018 to be the first year of lower copper production after providing for disruptions than the prior year, first time that\u2019s happened since 2011. The industry is \u2013 supplies, reflecting a very long period of under investments. And even as we speak today with higher prices, we don\u2019t see a wave of new investments being started immediately. So there\u2019s a real absence of major new project on the horizon declining production from existing mines, exchange stocks are low. So, what McKinsey is talking about having a need to balance the market of 5 million tons of new projects over the next decade with a long lead times, the few world-class opportunities with a new usage for copper, transportation and power generation and so forth. The outlook for copper is positive going into 2018 and very positive for the long-term. Now slide \u2013 the next \u2013 Slide 6 shows where we stand in the industry. Clearly, a leader. We operate all of the mines that we invested in. And if you were to look at the production of our partners and mines that we operate, we operate the leading amount of copper production in the world. Large scale, technical capabilities in all forms of copper mining, whether it\u2019s SX/EW open-pit, sulfide projects, underground mining, particularly block caving, where we\u2019ve been experiencing block caving since 1980s. We have the strong technical team, that\u2019s a huge, huge benefit for our company. And so, I \u2013 that\u2019s really strong competitive advantage. The supply situation, I think, is reflected on Page 7, where we have a listing of the largest copper mines in the world in terms of reserves and production. Notably, no \u2013 there are no mines on here that have been discovered in the last 10 years. In the last 20 years, the only two mines, Oyu Tolgoi and Las Bambas. Everything else is old ore bodies now, because we don\u2019t have new extent \u2013 new greenfield projects of size in the imminent outlook for copper demand, copper supply and makes it more significant these brownfield opportunities that we have with our ore bodies, and we\u2019ll talk more about those we have. Besides our technical capabilities, I think, the real strength of our company lies in our current resource space, our 2P reserves. So we\u2019re a big producer to about 4 billion pounds a year. But you look, we have proved and probable reserves of 87 billion pounds, mineralized material of another almost $100 billion pounds and potential of 150 billion pounds, altogether that\u2019s 335 billion pounds, now what does that mean? And by the way, of the total half of that\u2019s in North America. And today, in North America, with the power cost advantage that we have here in the United States, that\u2019s come about, because the shale revolution in natural gas and crude oil, with the improved regulatory situation that we\u2019re \u2013 that we now have, and with a very flexible work force, which allows us to deal with changes in our business, whether we\u2019re expanding or having to reallocate resources, the support we get from states, local communities, the big advantage of investing in the United States, which is still from a political risk standpoint, best country in the world. And now with this new tax bill, that \u2013 that\u2019s another advantage. Now, we are not like most trans national companies in the United States. We were already paying higher tax rate outside the United States than inside the United States. We also had a very large and we continue to have a very large loss carry-forwards for the oil and gas business. So we don\u2019t have the issue of repatriation. The taxes are much lower, current tax tax rates. But we do benefit from the fact that the AMT provisions were repealed, that\u2019s going to allow us to file for refunds over the next four years or so $400 million to $500 million of additional cash. The tax law retained a percentage depletion for mineral resources. So even looking out beyond the time that we have just a long period of time with these loss carry-forwards, the new tax law was a benefit to us long-term. So what we\u2019ve got these beyond our proved and probable reserves is really a great deal of optionality for the future. The strongest assets in the mining industry are long-lived assets. Long-lived assets, you don\u2019t face the investment risk. You don\u2019t have to have success, the Greenfield exploration. You don\u2019t have to make acquisitions when you have a resource base like the one that we have. And it\u2019s not limited to any single mine. We have a very large footprint with five operations in the United States that have very large sulfide resources that we\u2019ve identified. And over time, I\u2019m convinced that the world\u2019s going to need the copper out of those. South America, we have a really attractive project in Chile with our El Abra project, where we\u2019re partners with Codelco to develop a very large sulfide resource. Lots of capital, lots of studying be done. We\u2019re doing studies now. We haven\u2019t committed to spending capital on it, but we\u2019re preparing ourselves, too. We have a couple of attractive exploration projects. We had a exploration project in Serbia, where we entered into partnership with Nevsun, who is continuing to do drilling and they\u2019re looking to develop and \u2013 Upper Zone, the Lower Zone is of size, and we have a significant position in it. And while we sold our Tenke Fungurume project in the Congo, we still own an undeveloped resource that\u2019s in the area called Kisanfu. It\u2019s \u2013 we believe the largest undeveloped cobalt deposit in the world. It\u2019s permitted and we\u2019re looking at opportunities of developing it or entering into partnerships with other operators there. In the Congo, we have a lot of interest that people willing to buy that outright, but it gives us a lot of options to consider with this big resource. And in Grasberg district, while we have a clear cut plan of developing and operating. Through 2041, there\u2019s significant resources beyond that time, they will come into play. Looking at Americas, it was really strong performance. Congratulations, Red, and your team. In the fourth quarter, we sold 666 million pounds of copper in that quarter alone. I mentioned earlier, the Cerro Verde expansion, that concentrator averaged 374,000 tons per day in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s only 360,000 ton nameplate. I believe, it\u2019s the largest concentrator in the industry and is operating very effectively. We continue our focus on cost and CapEx management. Some factors are coming into increased cost at the margin. With the higher copper prices, our margins are growing, but we continue to be disciplined in the way we spend money. We are advancing these studies for looking for future growth. But you can just see what a great business this Americas business is. In the fourth quarter, we had $450 million, $500 million of cash flow after CapEx, and for the year over $2.5 billion. Still in our memory the time when it was said that Southwest copper district in U.S. was dead. Now it\u2019s profitable with major opportunities to invest capital, employ people. Our company supplies more than 40% of the copper to the U.S. district, and we\u2019re going to continue to take advantage of that. The sulfide projects in the Americas include five projects in the U.S. and the El Abra projects in Chile. These reserve numbers we\u2019re using is still based on a $2 copper mine plant, so there\u2019s significant upside at higher prices, both in our reserves and resources. But this is a \u2013 we\u2019re monitoring market conditions, going to be very disciplined in deciding when to go forward with it, but it\u2019s a strength of our company. One project we are moving forward with is the Lone Star oxide project. This has been a resource. It\u2019s been known for decades in the industry. It\u2019s located seven miles from our Safford mine, which is just across the mountains from Morenci and Eastern Arizona. We\u2019re going to start or we are starting with a project to mine an oxide cap to this big sulfide project. The current project has reserves of 4.4 billion pounds of copper. The capital would be $850 million spent over several years. We\u2019re commencing free stripping activities in the first quarter of this year. While this will serve to strip cover over the big sulfide resources going to be done in a very profitable way, because when you take that oxide material transport it to the Safford processing facilities, Safford is a mine, which is declining. It had a limited life, it has a big sulfide resource at depth. But now we\u2019re going to be able to use the facilities at Safford to mine this oxide or and have production of 200 million pounds of year for 20 years unit cost of $1.75 with over $1 billion of NPV at 350 copper. So it\u2019s a good project. But what it does, it gives us exposure to a sulfide deposit lying underneath the oxide deposit. It has 60 billion pounds of contained copper. Now this would involve ultimately the development of a big concentrator mill and so forth, but it\u2019s an attractive way to get exposure to that bigger resource. And we\u2019re showing the drilling that we\u2019ve done to date, that defines the resource and our 2017 drilling, which we spend a bit more money on than we had originally budgeted. But showed the extension of this sulfide resource, it was very positive. And as you\u2019ll note, you\u2019ve got some attractive grades that are in the current outline for the resource. But these deeper holes continue to encounter attractive grades going forward. So this is a great current and future opportunity for us. In Chile, the El Abra sulfide project is a good project. I mean, this is really a good project. It\u2019s a big project. It is in our inventory. We\u2019re working with our partners, who are working with other landowners in the region to see if we can cooperate with them. It\u2019s in an altitude if we acquire saltwater\u2026 Kathleen Quirk : Desalinization. Richard Adkerson : Desalinization project and transportation of that water of high. So it\u2019s going to be a big investment, but it\u2019s 2 billion pounds of 4 and 5 copper. Our correct expectation is that, it would involve the building of 240,000 tons per day concentrate somewhere to Cerro Verde could produce 750 million pounds a year. It\u2019s a six to eight lead-time and we\u2019re engaged in prefeasibility study and permitting panning now, so it\u2019s something that will develop over time. We\u2019re in no rush on this, but it\u2019s going to be a great project for Freeport in the future. And you can see the results of drilling that have been done to date. You can see the reserve pit that has been identified the mineralized material shale and the continuation of mineralization with our deeper drill holes as we go forward in Indonesia. So, Mark, I want to again, congratulate your team for meeting the challenges that we faced at job site, while we\u2019ve been dealing with this attention on the negotiations with government. I mentioned earlier, we had exports disrupted. We had labor problems. And the labor situation is so much better than they have been it\u2019s been since going back to 2010 timeframe. We\u2019ve had some security issues and that\u2019s Papua is always going to be a complicated place to operate. But in the last couple of months, we\u2019ve had some security issues. The thing that\u2019s encouraging now versus previous times is, we\u2019re getting great cooperation from the Indonesian authorities. The head of the police who had previously served in Papua is totally engaged. I\u2019ve got to know General Tito a number of years ago, he\u2019s very well regarded in the government, he understands it and he is committed to help us. There\u2019s a new head of the military and they\u2019re working together with the police. So you can see the results of that. And I know there\u2019s continued concern about the uncertainty about our contract and so forth. But the balancing deal we\u2019ve been working with is to progress the discussions with the government and take advantage of this high-grade ore that we have available to us as we mine the pit. My first trip there was 1988, when the second drill hole we drilled at Grasberg. I took a little picture of the exploration chat, where I took that picture to date. There is a pit, that\u2019s a kilometer deep and 2.5 kilometer across that \u2013 since that drilling has been developed, we\u2019re at the very final stages of mining to pit, very little waste material to move, very high-grades of the core of this ore body, and we\u2019ll be mining that for the next year or so. And so what that has generated for us this year, including negative impacts that we suffered at the first of the year is over $1.5 billion free cash flow, that\u2019s important to our company. Now, what is really important to our company is, getting the rights to operate through 2041. And I\u2019m pleased to report those negotiations are advancing in a mutually amicable way. We have very good working relationships with the ministers that have been assigned to represent the government on this. The negotiations are at times challenging as all negotiations are. But we have mutual respect, positive views about each other and a mutual objective of getting to this stability. Now, what we\u2019re pushing for is, having fiscal and legal certainty for our long-term mining operations, and that\u2019s through 2041. And that certainty means that, we end up with a agreement that gives us those rights reserved, so that they can\u2019t be changed by future laws and regulations. And the government has accepted that. We have agreed to provide mutual financial \u2013 provide financial benefits to the government that are in excess of those under our current contract, and that\u2019s principally by paying higher royalties, we redeploy higher royalties. We\u2019ve agreed to two things that the Indonesians have really described as being nonnegotiable from their perspective. One has to do with building new smelter capacity and we are looking, we are approaching this with a commitment to do it, we told the government that we would do it in conjunction with getting this extension. We are working now at looking at a partnership with a company called Amman, PT Amman which acquired Newmont mine in Zimbabwe, the Batu Hijau mine and it would make sense for us to do something together, so we\u2019re talking about that, but with any event we have committed that within five years of signing of definitive agreement, we will build this new smelter capacity and do it in as cost efficient way as we can. We\u2019ve also agreed and again this was a nonnegotiable point with the government of Indonesia that we would work to give the government of 51% interest in the project and the \u2013 what is actually a joint venture operations for the Grasberg operations between us and our joint venture partner. And we said we would do that so long as we have fair market value for any divestment and that fair market value would be based on valuations used internationally for resource assets and the government has agreed to that. We also said we would do it so long as Freeport we continue to have control over operations in the governance of the business. A very complicated business, we\u2019ve invested billions of dollars to date, we are going to be managing another multibillion dollars investments as we go forward. I\u2019m not stretching to say it\u2019s the most complicated mine in the world because of its physical location, it will be the largest underground mine ever developed, environmental issues are very challenging, community issues are challenging. We will work together as partners with the Indonesians and provide them a meaningful participation in it, but we need to make sure that it\u2019s run in the right way. That said, we\u2019re the best copper miner in the world, the governments state-owned business has some mining experience, but it\u2019s not anywhere near the scale of ours or with the complexity of ours and none within the copper business. So we have this mutual objective of completing the negotiations and going forward. Our temporary IUPK has been extended to June, our contract award today is in place, the government has agreed to that, we\u2019re exporting we expect to be about to continue to export and we are going forward. The government \u2013 we are aware that the government is engaged in discussions with our joint venture partner about the potential of acquiring their interest. In preparing for that they are going through a process of doing due diligence to build a record to show that they have \u2013 understand what they are doing. And we are cooperating with that providing them information, meeting with them and so we\u2019re helping to facilitate that transaction, that transaction would be the best outcome for all parties I believe, provided they can reach agreement on valuation. The valuation negotiations are between the government and our joint venture partner, that\u2019s a separate interest from ours, so we\u2019re facilitating the process, but that\u2019s part of the negotiations that we don\u2019t have control over. But all that\u2019s moving forward, as I said, a whole new attitude about getting there, allowing \u2013 the government recognizes we need to continue operating, they need the revenues in terms of their taxes and royalties, they need to have employment in Papua and all that translates to our, continue to generate cash flows. So really our Grasberg today is, we are completing mining the open pit. Development started in the early 90s in one of the great mining operations, most years we were moving 700,000 tons to a million tons a day and now it\u2019s coming to an end, but it\u2019s the same ore body that extends down to depths where it\u2019s more economical to mine underground and so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been focused on is the development of the Grasberg block cave. Now we are currently producing from an adjacent mineral system that we began mining in the early 1980s and we\u2019ve continued to mine at deeper horizons and expanding it and this mine currently that we\u2019re mining from is the DOZ, the new mine is the DMLZ which we began production in \u201815 or \u201816, in \u201816 and we continue to have the opportunity to expand this resource as we go forward. So add this altogether, we will \u2013 our plans call for us to process through our mill from the underground, ore at rates of about 240,000 tons per day, for the long term, continuing to 2041. And while \u2013 if you look at the next Slide 18, while all of this has been going on with the government and the labor and everything else, our team has just been plugging away at developing this Grasberg block cave infrastructure and we are virtually completed. We got access to the underground, we can\u2019t start developing the block caves until we complete mining from the pit, we are now completing the ore delivery system, there is actually a train involved with this and that will be done this year so that by the end of the year we\u2019ll be ready to turn the switch on, start mining from the pit, start mining from the over ground \u2013 underground. Now this has been a challenging high risk project and Mark and his team has done just a great job in focusing on that and getting that done and I will say that the risk of doing that are now behind us. Once we start managing the underground, we\u2019re going to be ramping up to where this mine will produce a billion pounds of copper a year. Very significant, a million ounces of gold a year on average and that will give it a really attractive cost structure. You know I don\u2019t do this very often, but just to put this in perspective of what we have here in the Grasberg underground, it\u2019s just under a billion tons of ore, with a copper equivalent approaching 1.5% when you add the gold into it. Las Bambas has just over a billion tons of ore, they have 0.8 copper equivalency. We would produce 31, over 30 billion pounds of copper equivalents, they have about 20. Cobre Panama, which is a great resource has over 3 million tons of ore, but a grade of 0.43 billion tons of ore, but 4, 0.45 copper equivalents. So compared with other great ore bodies around the world, this is certainly going to be one of them and one which we\u2019ll make a lot of money off of. So the key milestones that we\u2019ve completed to date shown on Slide 19, 220 kilometers of development, mine access, shaft, ventilation, rail connection, crushers, batch plant, and so we\u2019ve got work to do this year, but as I said, my view is the risk of development has been met. Now what does Indonesia get out of this? Well, it\u2019s a very attractive deal for the government on our existing cap. To date, they\u2019ve gotten almost 60% of the financial benefits of the total operations, we\u2019ve been there 50 years at Grasberg we discovered in the late 80s, since 1992 when our most recent contract came into place, we\u2019ve contributed $60 billion to their national GDP, the largest employer in Papua, one of the largest tax players in Indonesia. We\u2019ve contributed over $700 million since 1996 voluntarily to a Community Development Fund. And as we look forward for the government, future taxes, royalties and dividends through 2041 would exceed $40 billion, good deal for the government, good deal for our shareholders. 2018, our guidance continues the same at about 4 billion pounds of copper, 2.4 million ounces of gold, 90 million pounds of molybdenum, which by the way, is having a more positive price environment right now than we\u2019ve had in recent years. Attractive site production and delivery costs of $1.60 after byproduct credits about 90 \u2013 less than $1 a pound. And operating cash flows at $3.15, copper would exceed $5.8 billion highly leveraged copper prices each $0.10 is $360 million, just over \u2013 roughly $2 billion of CapEx, including $1 billion on the underground development in Indonesia and the development of the Lone Star project. And about $1 billion for other mining sustaining capital, some of which has been deferred in recent years, the clearly right cash margins over CapEx are unit cost. By area North America, South American and Indonesia are shown on Page 22, as well as our sales by region just make reference to that since I\u2019ve already talked about it. Our sales profile, as we look forward for the next two years, 2019 will be a transition year. We expect of moving from the open-pit at Grasberg to the underground. There is going to be as \u2013 while we\u2019re developing stockpiles and so forth, there will be a interim drop in production, which will build back up to a average over the next two years of approaching 4 billion pounds. And you can see that with our outlook for gold production. Quarterly sales are shown on Page 24 for the upcoming, for this year 2018. And then Page 25 shows a model that we show each year for the next two years, giving EBITDA and cash flow numbers. At $3.25 copper, we would have average $7.3, EBITDA of $5 billion of operating cash flows. 2018 will be higher than this average because of the transition year in 2019. And the sensitivities for our \u2013 the metals that we produce and the currencies presented on Page 26, capital expenditure outlook, which I referred to earlier, is \u2013 presented on Page 27, I\u2019ll just note that this does not include spending on the new smelter in Indonesia and we\u2019re looking at financing alternatives to finance that aggressively with project type financing for the smelter. So just going back to what we\u2019ve done with our balance sheet improvement over the last two years ending the year at $8.7 billion. And if we use all excess cash flow executed on our plan, realized these copper prices, you can see that our debt would drop. significantly during this upcoming year because of strong commodity prices. So in closing, we\u2019re really optimistic here about our company, about the outlook for copper and this long-term fundamentals. We like being the industry leader. We have a lot of Freeport people that listen to this call. And for all of you on the call in front of our investors and analysts, I just want to tell you how much I and our Board, being a Board and senior management team appreciate what everyone has done this past year. It\u2019s been a challenge. We\u2019ve had to support each other build our morale to come back. Two years ago, our \u2013 the market was telling us through the CDS trading that there was well over a 90% outlook that this company would default on its debt. That\u2019s two years ago. Now our credit default swap has gone from a high of 2,700 to below 150 basis points. We\u2019re going to get better. Our credit \u2013 I expect our credit rating to increase over time. But what I\u2019m really proud of is, what this team has done. We shown our metal. We continue to do that. I couldn\u2019t be more proud to be part of it and look forward to 2018 to be a year of ongoing and major progress and accomplishment. Kathleen Quirk : Operator, we can take questions now. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead. Alexander Hacking : Hi. Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. Kathleen Quirk : Good morning. Alexander Hacking : Regarding Grasberg and the potential that the government might buy the 40% stake from your JV partner, Rio Tinto, how likely do you think that outcome is? Is that now the most likely outcome in your view? Richard Adkerson : It\u2019s \u2013 at a stage of negotiation. So you don\u2019t want to get ahead of those negotiations. It appears to be the desire parties to do that. So I would characterize as a most likely outcome. Alexander Hacking : Okay. Thanks, Richard. And can you remind us of what Rio Tinto\u2019s CapEx commitment is to developing the underground? And would you expect that in the scenario, where the Indonesian government buys Rio Tinto stake that they would also assume that that share of CapEx commitment? Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Yes. We have an understanding within Indonesian government that \u2013 in the event that they do a deal with Rio Tinto Freeport\u2019s economics under the existing joint venture agreement would be preserved. Alex, you understand what I say? Am I saying clearly? Alexander Hacking : Yes, yes. Richard Adkerson : Okay. So\u2026 Alexander Hacking : Yes, I understand that clearly. Could you just remind us what Rio\u2019s commitments are? Richard Adkerson : All right. Well, it\u2019s complicated in that this joint venture agreement is relatively complicated, because under the agreement, which was signed in the mid-1990s, certain projects are designated as expansion projects and certain projects are designated as replacement capital. Rio Tinto placed 40% of the expansion projects and small amounts of the replacement capital projects, we\u2019ve agreed to share other projects 50-50. So there\u2019s not really an easy answer for that. But if you look from right now through 2022, when the conversion would be under the joint venture agreement to a straight 40%, after that, it\u2019s a 40-60 joint venture sharing straight up. Their projected cash flows\u2026 Kathleen Quirk : Pretty much offset the CapEx. Richard Adkerson : \u2026pretty much offset the CapEx, and those are going to be based on whatever copper prices there are. Alexander Hacking : Okay, thanks. That\u2019s clear. I\u2019ll let somebody else ask the question now and I\u2019ll hop back in the queue. But thank you very much. Richard Adkerson : Okay, Alex, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. David Francis Gagliano : Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just stepping back for a minute. Obviously, the balance sheet significantly better than it was. Stabilization in Indonesia, at least, seems to be heading in right direction. And it\u2019s like quite a bit of free cash flow generation potential. Way back when the management team, the Board did payout this free cash flow dividends, special dividends, pretty big one at points. And obviously, on this call, your opening remarks are really more focused on highlighting the project. So I have a high-class problem type of question. As we go through 2018 and 2019 is a preference to spend that cash on developing projects, or is there also thoughts towards giving some of that back to the shareholders? Richard Adkerson : These projects are very long-dated, Dave, I think, as you know. So we\u2019re not likely to be spending significant amounts of capital on these projects in 2018 and 2019. We\u2019re now building into our CapEx numbers this Lone Star project, which is a good project, but not huge. So with positive cash flows, my expectation was \u2013 is and we\u2019re \u2013 this is a Board decision and we\u2019re talking with the Board and this has emerged pretty quickly with the copper price coming back so quickly and so forth. But my expectations are that, we would be looking at our long-term tradition of returning cash to shareholders. David Francis Gagliano : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Richard Adkerson : And we\u2019re going to be very disciplined about all these projects. They\u2019re big, they\u2019re low risk. But we\u2019re \u2013 there\u2019s still risk to the global economy as we all know and we\u2019re going to keep our finger on it, see how it\u2019s progressing, how China is doing, how the rest of the world is doing. And \u2013 but my expectation is, we\u2019re going to be generating cash. And I believe, our Board will be predisposed to returning to shareholders when we can. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew James Korn : Hey, good morning, Richard and Kathleen. Thanks for taking my questions. At Grasberg, operational question, now given all the challenges in the last several quarters in the production side, maybe you can remind us if nothing would have changed from the current situation of the government? When would Rio\u2019s 40% stake kick in? Would that be 2022, 2023 now? And then once the whole Block Cave is ramping and you\u2019re deep into, maybe the next decade, everything is as it should be. What kind of production delivery cost that you expect once we\u2019re there and solidly on the ground? Richard Adkerson : Okay. So the answer to your first question is 2022 and sort of when in 2022 is at the margin could vary, but it\u2019s going to be expected to be then. And our net cash costs at $1,300 go and current levels of production is going to be in the neighborhood of\u2026 Kathleen Quirk : Low $0.50 a pound. Matthew James Korn : Okay. All right. Got it. And another thing that\u2019s come up as we talk to lot of companies is that the \u2013 now that there\u2019s no tailwind from currency, from oil other kinds of improvement, other kinds of help on the price or the cost side. People worried about wages, they worry about labor, they worry about capital goods. I\u2019m curious if \u2013 as you outlined your capital spending over the next couple of years, how much of that is on yellow goods? And how much of that would be exposed to, say, price that\u2019s not completely locked up, or PPI linked, or are you still don\u2019t have a complete visibility there? Kathleen Quirk : What we do have in our capital plans just maintenance and replacement of trucks. We tend to do a lot of truck rebuilds ourselves with our dealers on part. So there\u2019s in our sustaining capital a significant portion of that includes maintaining our equipment and replacing our equipment. We are seeing some past inflation. You can just watch the oil price and are seeing some cost inflation from oil-related prices. But our team is very focused on being very disciplined about spending money, both operating and capital and timing it in a way that that we\u2019re not in a rush to get the equipment. We\u2019ll do it in a smart way and be disciplined about, again, just trying to use what we have on hand and the new stuff that comes in just being disciplined about the timing of purchases of that equipment. But there is some cost inflation that\u2019s coming through both on operating and capital. Richard Adkerson : Yes, there\u2019s definitely some correlation between some of our input cost and copper price. I mean, that\u2019s just \u2013 I mean, we\u2019ve got trucks from Indonesia, in New Mexico right now and more on the way. Red, when is the last time we bought a new haul truck? Mark Johnson : 2008 was the last new haul truck. Richard Adkerson : New haul truck \u2013 last new haul truck we bought was 2008. So we\u2019re having great experience with this rebuild program. We\u2019re working on extending tire lives. I mean, it\u2019s a constant deal. We need as a senior management team with our mine operators the week before our earnings call. And this relentless effort these people have to try to find ways of offsetting cost increases with efficiency gains is really remarkable. I mean, we use a lot of diesel, but power for many of our operations comes from not from petroleum. And so, anyway, we\u2019re going to offset a good bit of that. But it\u2019s going to be a factor for the industry. I mean, we \u2013 lots of years we\u2019ve been Caterpillars biggest customer. I had a chance to glance over their earnings release early this morning. So I mean, you can just see what\u2019s going on that and labor issues will be an issue. And one of the things in terms of the industry is next year, there\u2019s a lot of labor contracts coming up in this year, I keep saying next year, 2018. Thanks, Red. This year, there are a lot of labor contracts in Chile and Peru coming up. And you can expect those negotiations to be challenging, it could be supportive from a supply standpoint. So Codelco has a real challenge in maintaining production. All these things are challenges for the industry, but they\u2019re supportive of supply. Matthew James Korn : Got it. Thanks for the comments. So good luck for everything. Richard Adkerson : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS. Please go ahead. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Yes. Thank you very much. Just a question on Grasberg there as well. You mention that the Indonesian government has agreed to pay fair market value or it considered the divestment at fair market value. It always seem that they did agree to fair market value, but their fair market value estimate was always much lower than yours. Would you say that effectively you have now agreed on a fair market value for the divestment, or are you still somewhat a part on that issue? That\u2019s the first question. Richard Adkerson : Let me answer that\u2026 Andreas Bokkenheuser : Yes, I\u2019m sorry, go ahead. Richard Adkerson : Let\u2019s go ahead and answer as you raised them. So one thing and those of you who are veterans of this know this. There are lots of things that come out in the Indonesian press that are comments about people either in government or in business who are not directly involved in the process. So be cautious in overreacting to things that you might see that are said. Now, we have not had a negotiation involving an exchange of values and so forth with the government of Indonesia on divestment values. What we have agreed to is a recognition that the standard for those negotiations would be as they are in all of the negotiations that we have standards related to way resources are valued in global markets. So this idea of limiting the valuation to 2021, when our primary term of our contract ends. Our saying, you don\u2019t take into account reserves and so forth. All of those things are not part of the discussion any longer. The government has appointed internationally known financial advisors to work with them in this process, and they are being engaged and it\u2019s being additive to the process. So while we have not negotiated value now, this issue with our joint venture partner really changes what the divestment obligation from Freeport would otherwise be. And so that negotiation is of much less significance to us than it would be if we were having to divest 51% of PT-FI. So all of that\u2019s in play. All of us had hoped that this would progress more by the end of 2017. But the government concluded they needed to go through a due diligence process and we\u2019re working very cooperatively with the government and its advisors on that process right now. So while I can\u2019t say that there has been this give-and-take or specifics on values, I do feel comfortable that the values that will be negotiated will be reasonable. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Thank you. That\u2019s very clear. And just a second question and I\u2019ll just talk about something other than just Grasberg. In your Americas operations, we did see a bit of a drop in lower grades and recovery rates as well, which is something you\u2019ve guided for before. Can you give us a sense of, is this mostly just one-off, or there sustainability to it on the operational side? Thank you very much. Harry \u201cRed\u201d Conger: Yes, Andreas, this is Red. We did have lower recovery primarily at Cerro Verde in the last quarter. We took or out of stockpiles in the area, in the where the material has been oxidized, but it didn\u2019t recover as well. We don\u2019t see that as an ongoing thing in the future. We\u2019ve also got some changes in mining rates in those kinds of things right now that are making the numbers jump around a little bit quarter-to-quarter, that\u2019s all going to even out as we go forward. Kathleen Quirk : As we look at the guidance going out for the Americas business, our numbers are relatively flat in terms of copper production that\u2019s sustainable over several years. Richard Adkerson : Over several years. I mean, we\u2019re brining \u2013 it\u2019s not a big numbers, but we\u2019re brining up Cerro mine and with higher moly prices. Its cost cost structure is attractive. And then I pointed out in El Abra, we are \u2013 where we curtailed production. We curtailed production in both of those operations when prices drop low. We\u2019re building those back up and then coming into play. Over time will be this Lone Star Project, which has cost structure that\u2019s right in the neighborhood of our current level of cost structures, so. Andreas Bokkenheuser : That\u2019s clear. Thank you very much. Richard Adkerson : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead. Christopher Mancini : Hi. Thanks a lot. Just first quick question is, just relative to this potential framework that you\u2019re talking about with Rio Tinto and the Indonesian interest having that 40% stake post 2022, just to be clear. So even if something were to be agreed to, say, in the next few months, Freeport would still have \u2013 would have 90% \u2013 would have the right to 90% or 90.5% of the economics of Grasberg until \u2013 until 2022, or whenever the Rio stake would kick in, right? Richard Adkerson : Yes. Now that is not a certain percent that varies because of this metal strip concept that was part of their original contract. But what I\u2019m saying is that, we have an understanding that we will maintain the economics for Freeport that\u2019s embedded in the current joint venture structure. Christopher Mancini : Okay. Richard Adkerson : And there are structures that that might change how that\u2019s done. But we reviewed that. We had very good discussions with the Indonesian, explained it to them, explained how important it is to us, because we\u2019ve worked all this time to take \u2013 to benefit from this period. And so they understand it and we have an understanding that our participation will not be diminished in the event of their acquisition of the Rio Tinto interest. Christopher Mancini : Okay, great. Thanks. And just a quick question about Lone Star. So you\u2019ve made the decision to proceed with the project $850 million and around $200 million pounds of copper a year. Could you just maybe describe your thought process relative to like how you think about approving certain projects relative to their the IRR, or the NPV of the project and what copper prices you use? And just generally speaking, how you evaluate it the decision to invest the capital in that project, and maybe how that might apply to, say, your next project like El Abra or something like that? Richard Adkerson : Well, it was a much easier decision. Let me just say with Lone Star then the next decisions will be. And that\u2019s because we had this unused underutilized processing facilities at the Safford mine that was nearby. So we didn\u2019t have to invest in a new SX/EW facility and so forth. So it was a pretty straightforward deal. I mean, this is near surface oxide material. You just need to determine how you mine it, how you transport it to the facilities. The rates returned very attractive. And it had the added benefit, as I said, of then exposing the sulfide or which would give us an option for future development of that. Around the world today, a lot of the newer deposits tend \u2013 most of the significant oxide projects have been developed. And so you\u2019re looking at sulfide deposits and frequently you\u2019re faced with a very large expense of stripping those to have that opportunity here. Our stripping is going to generate positive return for us. It\u2019s going to add volumes, attractive cost and serve for the stripping thing. So it was an easier decision. In looking at projects in general, we don\u2019t focus on any particular price. Now reserves are based on a $2 price. We talk about changing it. But that\u2019s kind of a regulatory disclosure issue and there\u2019s no sense in going through a huge internal exercise of raising the copper price $2.25 to $2.50. I mean, but when we come down to really thinking about investing in an El Abra, in a Lone Star sulfide or Bagdad sulfide or the next step at Morenci. We look at an array of prices and not just how that fits in with that project, but how it fits in with our overall portfolio. So that we think how would we manage this if things got tougher after we\u2019ve spent the capital. Can we deal with it? And then we won\u2019t \u2013 we have a positive long-term view of copper, so we want to take advantage of this. And so we have the optionality of having these big projects to participate in the long run. So it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m kind of like that add for the insurance company, the farmer\u2019s insurance company. I know a thing or two, because I\u2019ve seen a thing or two. And the \u2013 my experience has been, when companies get too formula-driven about hurdle rates and prices and things like that, there\u2019s another saying, I have around here is figures don\u2019t lie, but liars figure. And so, if you get too structured like that, people are going to play the games with you sometimes not intentionally, they come up with something that meets those formulas. So we go away from formulas. We work together. What I love about our team is, we\u2019re not negotiating between operators and corporate. Kathleen works with her team hand in hand with these \u2013with our team, as we\u2019re working and looking at this. And then we think about, okay, if we expose this capital, what risk are taken for the company going forward? How does it fit in with the rest of our assets? That\u2019s why we felt so good about the Tenke project. It was how risk, high return deal, when nobody else was going into the Congo. We didn\u2019t give any value to it when we bought Phelps Dodge. I wish, we still own it, but we did get almost $3 billion of value created. During \u2013 we started this in early 2008. So given the financial crisis and what\u2019s out with commodity prices, it was a good deal. But we recognize, it was a very high risk because of the political situation, the nature of the ore body and the mineralization, which was different than others. But \u2013 so that is much more of a\u2026 Christopher Mancini : Right, right. Richard Adkerson : \u2026interactive process we have been than something that\u2019s formula-driven. Christopher Mancini : Right. Kathleen Quirk : And the Ore Flow project fits right into our strength in terms of the geographic footprint, where we\u2019re already operating a lot of synergies of the Safford team with the Lone Star team. And one of the big things we look at in qualifying projects is the size of the resource and the life of the project. And just, because something has a high NPV, but if it has a short life, it\u2019s not something that we are excited about disposing dollars to it\u2019s more of multiples in NPV that you can get over a long period of time, so that\u2019s really\u2026 Christopher Mancini : Right. Kathleen Quirk : \u2026something that excites us. And looking at a range of copper prices like the Lone Star just for the oxide had a break-even up to 40 with an 8% return, with a lot of exposure to higher prices, but also exposure to the big resource that Richard talked about earlier. Christopher Mancini : Sure, okay. Right. So Lone Star really is just a little risk from a jurisdictional perspective, from a technical perspective, and it just provides you with lots of optionality to the upside. And so it just made sense to spend that capital. And then as these other projects kind of become available, you just have to weigh all of those different \u2013 all those different things in terms of the risk to completing it or a risk to operating at the optionality and what not. So I think I\u2026 Kathleen Quirk : Exactly. Richard Adkerson : You got it. Christopher Mancini : Okay. Okay, thanks a lot, guys. Richard Adkerson : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Gambardella : Yes, good morning, Richard and Kathleen. Richard Adkerson : Hey, Mike. Michael Gambardella : Couple of questions on Grasberg. But first, just congratulations on derisking of the balance sheet now work in the last couple of years has been significant. Richard Adkerson : All right. Thanks, Mike. Michael Gambardella : Looking back to the Grasberg, I just wanted to clarify, I think, what I heard you say before. So in terms of your agreement with the government right now, has the government formally agreed at if your stake were to go under 50% that you would still maintain operating control? Richard Adkerson : Yes. Well, Mike, I want to be clear about this. In some ways, I\u2019d like to just say, we\u2019re working on this and defer comments, but I know, we\u2019re just not in a position to do that. We\u2019re not in a position to do it with people who follow us and our shareholders, and the Indonesian government has to respond to the \u2013 they have to respond to their parliament. So we all have constituencies that we have to talk about these things when things aren\u2019t finally complete. I\u2019ve tried to use the word understandings, because while we did agree on a framework, we don\u2019t have formal agreements with the government yet. And there are still issues under discussion and we\u2019ve been very clear on our position. We believe we have gained the degree of understanding from the government. But there are different views within the government\u2019s team, the government itself. So this issue of control is one that\u2019s very important to us just because of the factors that I mentioned earlier, the nature of the project, and the importance of having a disciplined investment in this underground. If you \u2013 without having a disciplined approach to the underground investment, the value of this asset dissipates. I mean, because this is \u2013 as you know well, Mike, when you\u2019re dealing with these big projects and particularly Block Cave projects, you have to follow a plan and stick to it and deal with the long-term. So that\u2019s one thing that \u2013 the main thing that we\u2019re saying is, we have to be able to sustain that approach to investing and running this business. It is unusual, but not \u2013 but there are other limited cases of where investors own more than 50% of an asset economically and control is transferred to a minority owner. That\u2019s complicated, and all of that hasn\u2019t been worked out yet. But that \u2013 so I don\u2019t want to say that, we have a formal agreement with the government on that. And again, you\u2019ll see comments on that in the press that talk about that. We are committed to have a very successful partnership with the government, with their state-owned company. We\u2019ve pointed to them what good partners Freeport has been in all of our operations, whether it\u2019s our multi-project partnership with Sumitomo, with our partnership with Lundin that we had in the Congo, with the various partners we have in Cero Verde, with a partnership with Codelco in Chile. I mean, we do a lot of work with Rio Tinto. We\u2019ve had an excellent partnership with Rio Tinto. And the government really recognizes our operating capabilities and the need to have us to continue. So there\u2019s no question about that. It\u2019s this issue of how we work together in developing corporate policies and capital allocation, financial policy, purchasing policies, environmental, all those things that are so important to success in the operations. So, Mike, that will be part of the final agreement, and that\u2019s where we stand right now and that\u2019s what our position is. Michael Gambardella : From an economic standpoint, say, let\u2019s just assume, Rio Tinto signs a deal with the government, is your understanding that from an economic perspective aside from smelter, aside from that, is your understanding the economics of your agreement same as they are today there\u2019s no change or is there anything else that would? Richard Adkerson : Yes, that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve had \u2013 we have had good discussions. We spent time explaining this and so forth. So that the acquisition of Rio Tinto interest would not change our economics. Now, in the framework for reaching the long-term agreement, we have said that, we would agree that the government\u2019s financial benefits from the project will increase. These things may be reshuffled and reorganized in certain ways. But at the end of day, there would be \u2013 the government will be able to say to the people of Indonesia, they\u2019ve negotiated a larger participation. And that larger participation would come through the fact that we are paying higher royalties than under the cap. And in fact, we\u2019ve already been paying these high royalties since mid-2014. But the royalties would be, they use the term more than we do, but the royalties would be nailed down. In other words, we\u2019ll agree on the royalties today and that would be the royalties for the remainder of the project. We agree on tax elements now and we made a lot of progress in defining them. We agree on local taxes and fees, all that would be nailed down. Michael Gambardella : The final question on Grassberg. But the Board, could someone give us the feel for after tax situation. Right now, I thought you [Technical Difficulty] your entity? Richard Adkerson : No. Well, so Mike, you were fading out. So I don\u2019t cover your question. Come back and ask me to fill in. So the way that our tax situation has been structured, I mean, we\u2019re \u2013 FCX is a U.S. company then we operate in these countries where we have mines through entities in those countries. And those entities are subject to taxes and royalties in those countries. Then, under the previous tax law you would consolidate all of that into a U.S. company and you\u2019d have a consolidated tax calculation, but you would get foreign tax credits for taxes that you pay internationally. And then, and so, and there was limitations on that, there was this alternative minimum tax calculation that would come into play, but then you would calculate a U.S. tax on the base of that consolidated results. Now to the new tax laws, they\u2019ve gone to a territorial system and so now the, in large part the U.S. taxes will be based on the taxes for the income you generate within the U.S., the U.S. And within the U.S. we have a very large loss carry forward. We also have the benefit of percentage depletion which was left in the law and the AMT was repealed. So, we will have no taxes for as far as you can see in the U.S. We will continue to pay the taxes in these individual countries based on their own tax laws and our stabilization agreements and so forth. Michael Gambardella : Fine, thank you, Richard. Richard Adkerson : Did that cover Mike? Michael Gambardella : Yeah and that covers it, thanks. Richard Adkerson : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead. Lucas Pipes : Hey good morning everybody and congrats on the progress in Indonesia. I was unfortunately on another call early on, this may have been addressed, but I wanted to touch on it, the net sum, I remember that there were export royalties in place while you were negotiating the new structure in Indonesia and I wondered to what extent is that currently being covered in the negotiations and Kathleen when you gave the $0.50 per pound cost guidance for I think 2022, would that include all of those royalty costs, in case they are even applicable? Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Yes, we are paying duties currently, export duties currently and those will face out once the smelter gets to a certain percentage, so post 2022 we have the new smelter completed in that timeframe, all of the concentrates will be treated domestically and there won\u2019t be a need to export concentrates and there will be no duty, but we do have duties in our current guidance for 2018 and 2019. Lucas Pipes : And could you remind me about approximately what amount per pound those duties are? Kathleen Quirk : You can see, we are paying roughly on the \u2013 just on the export volumes, we are paying roughly 5% currently and you can see in our \u2013 and I\u2019ll let David to follow up on the exact numbers, but in our operating summary we paid $0.34 and that included royalties and export duties, so it will get you to breakout. Lucas Pipes : Alright. Richard Adkerson : Lucas, you may understand this, but just to be clear for everybody, roughly 40% of our production at Grasberg is processed at the PT smelting facility at Gresik that we built in the mid-90s in partnership with Mitsubishi and other Japanese investors. There is no export duty on that. It\u2019s only own exports. And in your question you were talking about royalties and export fees, I mean we do have a royalty that\u2019s assessed on all of the production, it\u2019s unrelated to exports and then there is, we call it an export duty which has been the item of controversy that we\u2019ve had over the last three and half years. Kathleen Quirk : But the export duty, I guess in those export duty that\u2019s in our numbers or for PT-FI is just under $200 million for 2018. Lucas Pipes : Very helpful, thank you. And then maybe just to tie up some loose ends, I recall that was a $350 million Cerro Verde royalty dispute, has that been settled, could you give us an update on that? Kathleen Quirk : There is really no update from our fourth quarter release, I mean from our third quarter release. We are continuing to work with the government officials to \u2013 on a settlement that would waive penalties and interests associated with that dispute and those discussions are ongoing, but there is no updated at this time. Lucas Pipes : Alright, well, I\u2019ll leave it here. Thank you very much and good luck. Richard Adkerson : And Lucas that $200 million would reduce our taxable income, so that\u2019s a pre-tax number. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Michael Dudas : Thank you very much. Richard, just wanted to follow-up on your thoughts on the transition from the pit to underground, you seemed much more confident about that in de-risking. What are some of the absolutes that you achieved and what are some that we may look for as we look in for the fourth quarter of 2018 and for the first half of 2019 on the progress and the flow? Richard Adkerson : Alright, so that\u2019s why we added the slide, I think it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve used it. What was the slide number? Kathleen Quirk : On the milestone? Richard Adkerson : Yeah, on the milestone. Kathleen Quirk : Slide 19. Richard Adkerson : If you look at Slide 19, Mark, do you want to? Mark Johnson : Yes, a lot of the challenge in the Grasberg block cave, the ore body system as Richard indicated, the rail systems there to be finishing, the conveyors that will, the crusher is already placed. The conveyers would be complete all of the way up to the mill in May, so we\u2019ll have six months there where we\u2019ll be able to just convey development mark, which is significant, we\u2019re mining about 6,000 to 7,000 tons a day right now just in developing drifts. The access to the ore body is extensive in the undercut extraction level we\u2019ve got the service level, the ventilation is in place, so there is \u2013 all the pieces are there, what we are going to start doing in the late fourth quarter is that we\u2019ll start glassing in the undercut. And then in the beginning of 2019 we\u2019ll start taking draw bells and actually start pulling the material. The cave should develop very quickly, the area in which we\u2019re initially developing the ore body is in a very cave-able portion of the deposit. And at that point when we start that and the pit will be essentially done, there is a little bit of an overlap right now that we\u2019ve reviewed with our consultants, we feel that that can be like a three-month overlap of ongoing pit operations while the block cave, some of this blasting, some of this very \u2013 the initial starting of the block cave can go on without any impacts. We\u2019ve got a very good plan for managing the water from the pit. We been able to demonstrate that we can get the water out of the pit before the cave starts up. So there is a whole network or there is a whole list of things that we\u2019ve been checking off over the last year and a lot of it\u2019s been really just getting these meters of development. We did over 30 kilometers of development last year, that drops down little bit this year as we get the ore body developed, so we\u2019ll be doing about 2200 meters a month and all of that just is moving along very well. Kathleen Quirk : And the big deal in 2018 will be the installation of the ore flow and the scale. Mark Johnson : That\u2019s right, the shaft is commissioned, we were using that for people and so all these projects are all just starting to come together, the big one will be the ore flow system getting that and we\u2019re doing that a little earlier than what we originally planned and it\u2019s just to get the congestion out of the underground, it will be a much more efficient way of getting development muck out and getting men and materials in. Michael Dudas : Right, that\u2019s very encouraging, thank you for the update and my follow-up Richard is, I think we will on the corner, hoping some day these conference calls will be little less detailed in negotiations with Indonesia et cetera. If something comes together, however comes together and how do you think it\u2019s going to be announced? And what\u2019s the timeframe from, say, if there was \u2013 if it was announced tomorrow, how long it would take to get everything cleaned up and were there certain deadlines, et cetera? How long of a process and how clean of a process you think it will be if you can speculate towards that \u2013 towards the conclusion of this derisking? Richard Adkerson : Sure. And Michael, you\u2019re talk about milestones. I have two personal milestones, I\u2019ll share with you. Michael Dudas : Please. Richard Adkerson : One is, when we start paying dividend \u2013 when Freeport starts paying a dividend again; and two is, when I can take a group of analysts and shareholders back out to Grasberg to see the place. This underground mine, Mike, I can\u2019t tell you if you remember a trip we had a number of years ago out there, but this underground mine is really spectacular. I mean, it is not like anything you would think of as an underground mine. But it\u2019s like a major manufacturing facility to see. And so anyway, I just \u2013 Michael, I just want to say, but okay\u2026 Michael Dudas : Those are great milestones. Richard Adkerson : Yes. So what \u2013 actually, given the authority that the President has given to these ministers, reach an agreement is the key and documenting of things we\u2019ve already worked on. I mean, we\u2019ve gotten the form of the IUPK, where we\u2019re working on. There\u2019s an attachment. There\u2019s \u2013 coming up with the structure to assure us that it can\u2019t be changed by future laws and regulations. So there\u2019s not going to be, this is something that the government is authorized to do under current laws. So it will not require changes to their laws or the involvement in the parliament in changing laws. The parliament will be informed and involved from that standpoint. But once the agreement is reached, the process of getting it documented is, it will be straightforward and not time consuming. Michael Dudas : Excellent. Look forward to those dividends. Thank you, Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Novid Rassouli with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Novid Rassouli : Hi, Richard and Kathleen, thanks for taking my questions. Just two for you first on Indonesia. The ongoing due diligence related to Indonesia potentially purchasing your JV partner share, does that have the ability to potentially delay Freeport\u2019s goal of having an agreement here on the longer-term contract in the first-half of 2018? Richard Adkerson : No, the timeframe or the first-half, which is \u2013 has really been set more by the government is to allow for that due diligence. So, we had all hoped to have more formal agreements reached by the end of the year. But there was a decision that having the need for this due diligence and that\u2019s why the target of midyear has been put in place to allow for that due diligence. Novid Rassouli : Got it, make sense. And then my second question, I think, anybody has really talked or asked about the broader copper market. So I\u2019m going to go ahead and do that now. So based on the lack of investments over the past few years, as you highlighted in the past few calls, what do you expect the copper market to reach kind of peak tightness or deficits, I mean, in the coming years before maybe reaching an inflection point? As you said, we\u2019re kind of getting close to that 3.25 that you said is necessary for people that have the incentive to start investing, haven\u2019t really seen anything incredibly material yet. So just wanted to get a sense of how you\u2019re seeing the next two years and when we reach that inflection point? Thanks, Richard. Richard Adkerson : All right. Well, thank you, Novid. The \u2013 you tell me what global growth is going to be. You tell me what China\u2019s going to be, because my view is the supply side of this subject to the uncertainty about disruptions, which could only be supportive of supply. They\u2019re not going to add supply, but they could take it away, is pretty clear cut at this point. Surprises will be on the negative side. You\u2019re not going to see somebody say in the near-term, we\u2019ve got significant amounts of new production that nobody knew about. People will work to \u2013 at the margin increase production, but it\u2019s just going to be at the margin. And you know, you look at the long-term projects that are out there, whether they\u2019re \u2013 whether it\u2019s resolution Olympic dam, our big projects that we\u2019re talking about El Abra and others, there\u2019ll be more copper coming out of Africa, I believe, based on our experience there. But that\u2019s going to unfold over a number of years because of the nature of the mineralization and how it has to be mined. You look at the experience of Oyu Tolgoi, it\u2019s a great resource, great ore body. But the number of years that it\u2019s taken to ramp up and the continuing issues they face with border crossings and power and the government. I mean, that\u2019s just fundamental to all these big projects. So I think, you can your arms around supply outlook relatively easy. And then you plug in your own view about what you think the global economy is going to do. I just went back to Houston this week to give a luncheon address, not to a mining group, but to a general business group. And of course, it took me back after living in Houston for so long. And back in my earlier career one of my first clients was Mitchell Energy, which kind of kicked off the shale industry in the mid-1980. In the oil and gas, people were asking me, is there anything like share for the copper business? Because nobody expected the U.S. to bypass Saudi Arabia and Russia and to produce 12 million barrels of oil a day. I mean, back in the 1980\u2019s, we were thinking of importing 75% of the oil production dropping to 4 million barrels. But the great thing about copper and you take it with a grain of salt, because my feelings on this, which have been the same basically since of I became CEO in 2003 is, its uses are just built into the economy in such a way that it\u2019s really hard to replace for its basic usage, you can do it for plumbing and things like that. But when you look at the way the world\u2019s going with the electrical \u2013 electronics everybody talks about electric vehicles and that could be a big deal. Alternative energy development could be a big deal. But just how much electronics are increasingly built into our lives, whether it\u2019s communications or control systems, power delivery systems, the development of the world for basic things like refrigerators and air conditioners, maybe I shouldn\u2019t say washing machines. But in any event, it\u2019s just a commodity, I think, that is so well situated for how cheesed in the economy. And \u2013 but \u2013 so you\u2019re subject to the risk of the economy of China on the global economy. But supply side, there\u2019s no shale copper coming on stream. People are talking about mining in the ocean or on asteroids and things like that. But we should \u2013 we\u2019re just seeing in terms of basic production, the new projects are a major less quality than the old projects were. They have much lower grades. You have to do a lot more stripping, building infrastructure, getting water, getting power, all of these things make the supply side of copper, I think, extraordinary well supported. I tell people today, we can increase price of copper to $6 a pound overnight, and we have what I just show 300 billion pounds of undeveloped copper resources. We could not bring them on stream to five to 10 years from now, even with $6 copper. So it\u2019s a great commodity and that\u2019s why I like where our company is so on. Novid Rassouli : Thanks, Richard. Richard Adkerson : Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Operator, are there anymore questions? Hello? Richard Adkerson : We can\u2019t seem to get to the operator. So I don\u2019t know if everyone else is still on the line, but\u2026 Operator : This is Lucie [ph]. Can you hear me? Kathleen Quirk : Yes, we can. Operator : Okay. We had an issue in a call center, I do apologize. Our next question will come from the line of Piyush Sood with Morgan Stanley. Piyush Sood : Hi, Richard and Kathleen, thanks for taking the questions. First one, at Grasberg, it seems like total CapEx to be spent over the next five years may have declined to about $900 million to $1 billion. I just wanted to understand if that\u2019s surrounding it, or is there something else over there? Kathleen Quirk : No, there really wasn\u2019t anything. It was just the time period of five years that we will, incurred last quarter versus this quarter and the way the rounding fell. So no material differences in our plans. Piyush Sood : All right. And staying with Grasberg, labor relations at Grasberg seem to have improved. So could you comment on maybe worker productivity, how you\u2019re taking care of expectations around employment as you move underground? And when we could expect the new labor contract? Richard Adkerson : Okay. So we signed a new labor contract in December, that\u2019s for two years, under Indonesian law, we have to do a new one every two years. So we have signed it. Mark make some comment \u2013 I\u2019ll let you make some comments, because you live with this thing. Mark Johnson : Yes. Well, 2017 was a very dramatic year on the labor. In February, we had 32,000 employees and has combination of employees and contractors. With the export ban, we had some cost reductions, it was kicked off with a 10% employee hurdle program. After we started that program, we had a number of employees that went on an informal strike, it was not a legal strike, it started missing work. And with the labor laws in Indonesia, they essentially resigned their positions. And that resulted in about 5,000 employees leaving. Recent to that, it\u2019s back about 4,000 contractors, so we went from 32,000 to 24,000. And now we\u2019re back up to around 28,000. The PT-FI component of that is under 8,000 employees now, it was 12,000. The contractors that we hired in have been very cooperative, have been very energetic. We\u2019ve had a very good response. As kind of a byproduct with the new guy coming in, our PT-FI work forces also picked up the efficiencies and we\u2019re seeing a much improved morale, our safety. With all of that transition, we have the lowest incident rates for our reportable accidents that we\u2019ve ever had since the beginning of the project. So we feel good about the status of our labor force, the composition of contractors and internally employees, and really the effectiveness of our supervisors with under a new \u2013 kind of a new composition of labor. As Richard said, there was a lot of transition within the labor unions that we\u2019ve dealt with their leader had been removed. He had some legal issues. He\u2019s out of the picture. The new team has come in has worked very closely with us. There\u2019s a second union that we\u2019re dealing with, that was kind of a new component of our negotiations this year, but all of that worked out. We went on a little bit longer. But we didn\u2019t have any threats of strikes. We didn\u2019t have any concerns that the workforce is going to \u2013 have any sort of a walkout. So during that whole period of negotiation, we didn\u2019t see an interruption in our production, and it allowed us to focus on safety and bringing these guys on and focusing on the project. So we saw some benefits in there, for instance, in the Grasberg pit. Our unit rates went down by about 30% in the fourth quarter to what they\u2019ve been in the first part of the year. So we\u2019ve seen efficiencies. We\u2019re getting more out of each worker, and that\u2019s also run into on the development side and then into the capital projects. So we feel well-positioned in 2018 with the group that we have. Richard Adkerson : And for years, we\u2019ve been planning for this transition, because it is new skills, new work requirements and so forth in the underground from the open pit without the drivers for the all trucks and the big electric shovels and so forth. But we\u2019ve been doing that and it\u2019s much more mechanized. So anyway, that\u2019s all progressed very well. Piyush Sood : Great. That\u2019s helpful. And Kathleen, you did comment on the long-term prospect for Grasberg at about $0.50. But just want to understand as we go into a transition year in 2019, is there kind of a step down coming in your total cost over there or would cost kind of lag \u2013 the decline in total cost lag while maybe production also \u2013 so should we kind of expect cost to go up drastically on a per pound basis or do you have some control around that? Kathleen Quirk : In terms of absolute cost, we are not anticipating any significant changes on a unit basis, on a metal basis you know it will depend on the volumes and the grades that we\u2019re mining, so in 2019 as we get into a lower year, we will have higher costs than what we had in 2018, but it is still very, very attractive on a unit basis although it\u2019s cost mine in the company. So, as we go forward, we start to improve on the volumes after 2019 and the cost position goes down as a result on a metal basis per unit, but in terms of absolute costs, we are not expecting to have major changes in the absolute total costs of the operations. Richard Adkerson : You know generally our costs are fixed, there are some things that vary, so when definitely some of that cost going up is unit cost going up, absolute cost we\u2019ll continue to manage to keep as low as we have, but for most part that\u2019s fixed. Piyush Sood : That\u2019s very helpful, thanks so much for the color. Richard Adkerson : Alright thank you, so let\u2019s have our last question and appreciate, I think it was, Michael was saying he looks forward to when we don\u2019t have to talk so much and nobody looks more forward to that than me. Operator : Okay, our final question will come from the line of Karl Blunden with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Karl Blunden : Hey guys thanks for taking the question, all the questions today. I think you had alluded to this a bit in the call, a question back on Grasberg. So it sounds like potentially if the government is looking to get a 51% stake in the asset that Rio\u2019s stake would count towards that, is it clear that you\u2019d be able to I guess get away with a much smaller divestiture than initially thought about? Richard Adkerson : Well, I would not use the term get away with, you know, but you know if Rio Tinto wants to sell they would reach agreement and they buy, it means that there will be a much lower level of divestment that would come to PT-FI. So the government currently owns 9.36% of \u2013 in effect the long-term 60% interest, so that\u2019s 5% plus. Rio Tinto has 40% and so our remaining divestment obligation would be roughly 10% of PT-FI which would be another net 5% plus, so that\u2019s the way the math would work and it\u2019s all contingent on everybody reaching an agreement on that transaction. That\u2019s the best outcome considering that Rio \u2013 it\u2019s up to Rio Tinto, they have been great partners, so anyway, but then their negotiations are with the government, we\u2019re facilitating them, but they have direct negotiation with the governments, so it would ought to be an elegant outcome. Karl Blunden : That\u2019s very helpful. And then you mentioned earlier credit ratings momentum certainly been positive, what are the next steps we should look at or what are the gating factors on further upward momentum for you guys when you discuss this with the agencies? Kathleen Quirk : Well, I think you know if you just look at our credit statistics and our balance sheet and cash flow generations, and really the portfolio of the assets that we have in the company I think our credit metric signals high ratings, but won\u2019t continue to review these with the agencies as we go forward. Richard Adkerson : Look, we\u2019re focused on getting this Indonesian thing resolved and recognizes and until we do, you know that\u2019s going to be a factor for credit ratings, stock valuation, share valuation and everything, so we know what we need to do and we are focused on getting it done. So, let\u2019s see. Kathleen Quirk : Are there any more questions? Okay. Richard Adkerson : Okay listen, thanks for all of you who stuck around to the end of this and we appreciate your interest. If you have follow-up questions contact David Joint, thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for joining.

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today\u2019s call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet. And anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today\u2019s call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Red Conger is here, Mark Johnson is on the line, Mike Kendrick is here as well. I\u2019ll start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will review our recent performance and outlook. As usual, after our remarks, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions. Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of 692 million for the first quarter of 2018 or $0.47 per share. That included net credits of 13 million or $0.01 per share in the first quarter. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation for the first quarter of 2018 totaled 1.93 billion. There is a reconciliation of the EBITDA in the back of our slide deck on slide 27.  As summarized on page, Roman numeral 7 of the press release, our EBITDA was reduced by 135 million in the first quarter associated with the impact of the decline in copper prices during the period from $3.28 at the start of the year to $3.04 per pound at the end of the first quarter. The adjustment relates to sales that were provisionally priced at year end that were marked to actuals during the first quarter and sales that were open at the end of the first quarter and those were marked at $3.04, which was the forward price at the time of our quarter end. Our provisionally priced sales are mark to market until final settlements occur. Our copper sales during the quarter were 993 million pounds, gold sales were 610,000 ounces and we sold 24 million pounds of molybdenum. Gold sales were above the year ago quarter by a significant margin, but we're about 10% below our guidance of 675,000 ounces because of maintenance on the ore flow systems in Indonesia. Our first quarter 2018 average realized copper price was $3.11 that was above the year ago quarter average of $2.67 and gold prices averaged 1,312 per ounce in the first quarter of 2018. That was also higher than the $1,229 per ounce level in the first quarter of 2017. Our unit cash cost, net of byproduct credits, for our consolidated operations, averaged $0.98 per pound in the first quarter of 2018. We generated strong cash flows above our capital expenditures. Our cash flows from operations in the first quarter totaled 1.4 billion and that exceeded our capital expenditures of 400 million. We continued to strengthen our balance sheet. During the first quarter, we repaid borrowings totaling 1.5 billion and in April, in the second quarter in April 2018, we repaid 454 million in debt associated with the early redemption of higher coupon notes. We ended the quarter with consolidated cash of 3.7 billion and our consolidated debt totaled 11.6 billion. So, our debt, net of cash, was below $8 billion at quarter end. We had no borrowings and 3.5 billion available under our revolving credit facility at the end of the quarter. We reported earlier this week that we have entered into a new $3.5 billion five year revolving credit facility to replace the existing facility, which was scheduled to mature in May of 2019.  We\u2019re pleased with the outcome of the new arrangement, which is substantially similar in structure in terms to the prior facility. Also during the quarter, our board of directors reinstated a cash dividend on our common stock, which we\u2019ll talk more about financial policy, but the first quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share will be paid -- has been declared and will be paid on May 1.  I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Richard who will be commenting on our slide presentation, which is located on our website. Richard Adkerson : Good morning, everyone. Refer to slide 3. Today, we're actually mailing out our annual report for 2017. You see a picture on the cover and some comments that are summary comments from the annual report. It reflects our leadership position in the copper industry. We operate \u2013 we\u2019re the largest operator of copper mines in the world. We operate all the mines that we have interest in. We have a set of high quality assets that would be very difficult to replicate in today's world and a very experienced team of mine developers and operators that are well respected and have had great success in developing and operating mines and our company has a focused strategy as we go forward. With respect to financial policy, on the next slide, we have a balanced approach. Over the past two years, we've been very successful in taking our debt down from unsustainable levels to below our targeted levels actually. And as we look forward, we will be generating substantial cash flows in excess of our capital spending and we will use those cash flows to further reduce debt. We're assessing future investments and we have a number of alternatives that we are pursuing and we\u2019ll move forward with in a disciplined way and we started paying a dividend now and so we're focused on returning cash to shareholders over time. We'll continue to delever. We will invest in a disciplined way. We will look to increase the dividend either as regular dividends or as special dividends, we go forward in the future. In the first quarter, we maintained our focus on productivity cost management, cash discipline and as Kathleen said, our operating cash flows exceeded our CapEx by about $1 billion. Our unit net cash costs were below $1, significantly lower than the year ago quarter. We repaid $2 billion of debt and our net debt is below $8 billion and we're working hard to advance planning for our development activities. Copper markets, every quarter, I get a one page report from our marketing team about copper markets and I'm just going to read the headlines of the report I received yesterday. Copper demand steady after a quiet spot market in the US, positive sentiment in China, European cathode consumption, improving as scrap is driving up, Japanese copper sectors are positive. That tells the story about where we are and today Steve Higgins sent me a note saying that we're getting a great start off into the second quarter. We supply about 40% or so of the copper used downstream in the US market from our mines in the US.  And right now, we're actually having to purchase cathode in the marketplace to meet the demands of our customers. The long term fundamentals for copper are increasingly strong, was down at Cisco and that was a common theme, you hear from everyone. Deficits appear inevitable, absent turmoil and downturn. In China, the global economic situation and with the low carbon environment is very positive for copper with electric vehicles and alternative energy generation. We have significant leverage to copper prices and we're positioned to take strong advantage of this. In Indonesia, you're aware that in 2017, we reached a framework for our long term resolution to provide that stability. And that\u2019s our key to have stability through 2041, the term of our existing contract with fiscal terms and legal terms that would be stabilized and not subject to future changes. We made continued progress. We have motivated parties to this on our side, on the government side. I met with the finance minister in Washington next week where she was there for the -- in Washington last week where she was there for the World Bank meetings and did a presentation and she reaffirmed the government -- the president's objective of getting this resolved and was optimistic about it.  We're working to complete negotiations and the required documentation as quickly as possible. Where we stand now, the government is in negotiations with our joint venture partner about the potential acquisition of that joint venture interest. That would be very positive for us where negotiation of shareholders' agreement to deal with the issue of managing the business, it's important for us that we continue to have control over the way the business is managed and its financial policy. We're working on the form of the stability agreement. Both parties recognize the objective of stability and we need to have this in a form that is satisfactory.  And we're dealing with some new environmental claims that have come out of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. These were really shocking and disappointing to us and they don't really deal with the technicalities of environmental management, but the new position really expresses a fundamental view about the way the tailing system is managed. Back in the 1990s, in a transparent and comprehensive process, we, our joint venture partner and the government reached a conclusion to deal with the real complicated challenges of managing tailings at the Grasberg with its high elevation, high ranged ball and extraordinary large volumes.  We all agreed at that time that we would use a river system that was designated to transport the tailings [indiscernible] and the tailings would be a positive out there, positive there with a portion going ultimately into the Air Force C. That was concluded to be the best system then. We\u2019ve now operated it for 20 years. The good news is it has operated as it was designed with no unanticipated, with no unanticipated impacts. Our tailings fortunately have chemistry that makes them benign. There have been no human health issues or impacts on the environment that wasn't anticipated.  It was always controversial, but it was a decision that was basically said, are you going to develop this mine in this location or not. And it was agreed to, we followed it, we're going to work with the government. In a complicated system like this, there are always technical and environmental issues to deal with. We have and we will continue to work cooperatively to deal with that. But you simply can't say 20 years later, we're going to change the whole structure of what we're doing, you can't put the genie back in the bottle. And so it -- we're surprised others in the government are surprised and it's just something that we'll have to work with. I'll tell you this, it has no impact on our view of the value of our asset. Now, we did have a very positive development with the government. Just last week, we had had had an ongoing dispute with the province, over the province\u2019s imposition of a surface water tax that was contrary to our contract of work. I want to say at the very outset is that we want to support the province. Since 1996, roughly 20 years ago, we've contributed over $700 million voluntarily to a fund to support the local community and we continue to devote 1% of our revenues to support that fund. Under the new agreement, we're working with the government in terms of taxes and royalties of greater percentage of those payments to the central government will go to the province. We're very supportive of that. So it's not a question of Freeport not supporting the province, it was a large assessment that the province made arbitrarily contrary to our cal, our total exposure was on the order of $500 million. We were disappointed that the Tax Court did not rule in our favor, but the Supreme Court did and the good news about it in the Supreme Court's finding, they pointed out that our contract was approved by the government in 1991 that it\u2019s binding on the government and on the regional government that the contract is specific in nature, Lex specialis, which means that it is a law that overrides general law and it governs the operations with the parties.  The contract, provides it should be carried out in good faith. It was a very positive decision by the Supreme Court and we congratulate the government in this step in establishing the rule of law, which will encourage further investment in Indonesia. So we are encouraged -- we're continuing to work with the government. The next step is completing the divestiture process. Grasberg Block Cave had significant progress in the first quarter. We actually commissioned the train and track that to keep part of the system while delivering over to our mill from there. We also commissioned a major uploading station. Significant work has been done to develop this high grade large scale mine. This is the same ore body that we're mining from the pit. We're just simply using block cave mining rather than surface mining.  It is a major resource, almost 1 billion tonnes of ore that's over 1% copper and over 0.72 grams of gold over the life. It makes it very profitable with a very low cost, just in going forward. As we look at what this is, it really, as we complete mining from the pit, which we expect to do by the end of this year, there will be a ramp up period like a new project because we can't mine underground until we're out of the pit because of the subsidence of the surface underground and so this is really like starting up a new mine and there will be a period of time of ramp up, beginning in 2019 and within a three year period or so, we'll be up to full production from that.  The good news is, we're ready to go with it. I mean, the basic system is in place. That's a big step. It\u2019s like completing the mine at Cerro Verde. I mean, if you looked at this project over a number of years, there were risks associated with it and we said that we needed those risks. I want to address the deep MLZ mine. This is a separate ore system, which report begin mining underground in the early 1980s and it has successfully extended that ore body separate from the Grasberg ore body at deeper levels and the deep MLZ is the most recent extension that started with a near surface mine and went to an intermediate mine, the DOZ mine and here we are now. Now, it is a distinct post rock situation from the Grasberg Block Cave. The rock here is much more competent, hard. It has substantially more \u2013 is substantially lower from the surface and so it has a different rock characteristics and pressure environment. We have been ramping this mine and we began to encounter mining and used seismic activities. This is not earthquakes or natural systems, but as we create the Block Cave, it has created seismic events that has caused us to slow down the development to manage this safely. Our first priority is to keep our people safe and we're doing that.  We had some new events in the first quarter and so we're not able to meet the schedule that we had planned going into the quarter. But our team and we've got a world class team of outside experts that\u2019s meeting with us continually on this. I had a report from this past week and we have got a plan to help deal with this safely over time. We do not expect this and are confident that it will not affect our longer term mine plans, our ultimate reserve recovery. In fact, our new adjustment for our five year plan from the underground, we have higher volumes coming over the next five years than we did going into the quarter. But near term, we are modifying our mine plans and we're continuing to review it and it's just one of those things about mining that you have to deal with. And as I said, we're being cautious because we want our people to be safe, but we're confident we can deal with this. So talk about another project, the Lone Star Oxide development project that we reported on previously, reserve of 4.4 billion pounds of copper. We have a project in place to invest $850 million and we will be able to use the production infrastructure and facilities that we have at the adjacent Safford mine, which is a mine that began production 11, 12 years ago and now has available capacity to take this new oxide or we began pre-stripping in the first quarter. It will be a very profitable high return project, 200 million pounds of copper a year with a 20-year mine life, cash cost of $1.75, over $1 billion NPV plus $3 copper and -- but importantly, it will strip this oxide and waste layer from this area, exposing an increasingly attractive sulfide deposit. And to show what that is, on slide 11, we show recent intercepts of our exploration drilling, which we have done some in the past and we're initiating a new program and it\u2019s some very attractive intercepts in this area, in this environment. You can see the last two intercepts or drilling that's been done this year, we're continuing to drill. This is pointing towards a mineral system that could well be consistent with a nearby Morenci mine. It could be that large and so it's a great indication of the future of our company right here where we have existing operations in a community that's supporting of us and it could be very, very large and this is new information for us in terms of the extent of it. Page 12, I won\u2019t go with this because we review it every quarter, shows just the number of opportunities we have to develop our reserves. Our 2P reserves are over 60 billion pounds of copper. And then at $2 copper, this is in the Americas, in the US and in South America and we have huge volumes of mineralized material and potential associated with this. This is low risk development, extension of our existing operations. We're doing tradeoff studies now to see where our first step will be in developing this resources. In my personal view, this is a key asset of our company. Our outlook for 2018 is presented on slide 13. It's consistent with our previous guidance and we will be generating, at today's copper prices, substantial cash flows well above our capital expenditures, which will allow us to progress our financial policy, our sales profile numbers is shown on page 14. 2019 reflects the completion of the mining of the open pit at Grasberg and the beginning of the ramp up of the underground mine there. The adjustments that you see there of about 150 million pounds reflects the issue that we have with the Deep MLZ and that reflects also, you can see the 2019 goal and we will again emphasize that this is not lost resource. This is a question of the timing of when we access to it. We're going to access it as quickly as we can, consistent with maintaining the safety of our people and our operations. Our standard slide on EBITDA and cash flow is presented on page 15. Average EBITDA at $3 to $3.50 copper is roughly 6 billion to 7.5 billion. This is a three year average from 2019, 2020, 2021. Average operating cash flows from $3 to $3.50 is 4 billion to 5.5 billion. Capital expenditures are roughly in line with our previous guidance. The major projects include the continuing Grasberg underground development and Lone Star. We have been very aggressively, for years, constraining our stay in business, our sustaining capital and now we're having to spend some money to deal with the deferrals that we had in previous years, but we will be very disciplined the way we spend capital and generate lots of cash flows. A slide we're all proud of here at Freeport is on page 17. We went into 2016, $20 billion of debt, lots of uncertainties. That time a year ago, on this call, I said we would try to reduce our debt by $5 billion to $10 billion over a two year period. We\u2019re now less than 8 billion and as we look forward to the end of the year, we will have this debt down with copper prices on the order to roughly $5 billion to $6 billion. So great success story. Reference slides included there, so I want you to quickly go through those slides to give us time for questions.  And operator, we will open the call for questions now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Korn : So you've taken down, looking at your slide deck, you\u2019ve taken out 2019 expectations pretty substantially, making it even more of a transition year. With the DMLZ the main factor it appears, are there any other changes or reductions across the regions embedded in that 2019 number? And then is there any flex available across the other assets that could make up any of that production to the upside? Richard Adkerson : The answer to your first question is no, there's -- I mean every quarter, I think you all know we don't have an annual planning exercise. We update our plans every quarter. If you had seen Red's team in here last week, and this is just the normal ups and downs for the rest of our operations. Outside of Grasberg, outside of PT-FI, there's really no magic bullet we can do in the short run. We have a mantra of pushing safe production and we do that continually and we\u2019ll continue to do that. We are working to progress the Grasberg Block Cave mine and we're making some progress in seeing how to maximize that as we go forward. Interesting time for the remainder of 2019 in the pit as we -- 2018 in the pit as we finish mining in the pit and try to get as much out of that as we can. So this is really a factor of having these seismic -- mining and do seismic events that were not anticipated, not in our original plans and so this is one of the things you deal with in mining and that's what's causing this impact. Matthew Korn : Got it. Now let me ask more in the immediate than. Could you tell us a little bit more about what prompted \u2013 what looked like to be the unexpected maintenance activities here at Grasberg, what the status is there and then when you're thinking about today, looking through the rest of the year, what are the main risks you think the output reaching your expectations there at that mine. Richard Adkerson : Okay. So, the Grasberg development is now 20 years old. I mean, we began production of the expanded facilities in January 1998. That was when we built our big sag mill and the ball mill systems. We completed the overflow system using these ore passage ways and developed a system of ore delivery from the passageways to the middle. So the truth is these things have [indiscernible] and we've had a system of maintenance. In doing a current review of that, these problems were really in some ways a function of the times we've gone through in recent years of where our production has been interrupted by export bans, labor issues and so forth. And so now that we're operating in a normal fashion and our mill, our mine rates, our labor situation has been very good and we return to a more normal function. As we ramped up, we found that we had these ore delivery system maintenance issues. We realigned resources in Indonesia, but we also marshalled resources from our global team and have sent them out there to rectify the situation. And so we are dealing with it. This will be something that is important to us as we have the high grades from the pit in the remainder of 2018 and then as we ramp up the underground, it is important that we have the ore delivery systems operating effectively. We've also had, along with that, some issues related to our -- the ore that we're feeding into the mill and that is a point in time issue. We're not mining waste -- we're mining ore and some of that ore, as we mined it, has been placed in the bottom of the pit, which you know the conditions out there are very wet and that's created some of this ore having a stickiness to a clay like situation to it, which is complicated, both overdelivery through our ore passes and the feed into the mill. So there's some special point in time operating issues related to where we are in the pit and we're addressing those and then we're addressing these maintenance issues to not only allow us to operate effectively for the rest of the year, but also to then have the systems ready for the ramp up of the underground ore from the Grasberg block cave that's going to start very early in 2019. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley FBR. Lucas Pipes : I wanted to follow up a little bit on the situation in Indonesia. Richard, last quarter, you were pretty outspoken in terms of the likelihood of a resolution. How do you see things, where do you see things standing today? How quickly do you think you can look towards a resolution at this time? Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Okay. Thanks. I've retained my optimism. The reality is the government late in 2017 concluded that they needed to do a due diligence process. I mentioned this last time, they hired an internationally known investment bank, a major accounting firm, international lawyers and a mining due diligence firm out of Australia to assist them with that. That process took longer than I expected. This is a government entity with a lot of players involved that are experienced in doing things like this. So it's not surprising, but it took long. It appears and these parties will speak for themselves because we're facilitating negotiations, but not participating in the negotiations, the negotiations between our current partner and our future partner.  So it's a sensitive matter for us. And those negotiations have started. You have an apparent willing seller, certainly a motivated buyer, indications are that the President of Indonesia remains focused on seeing this deal through. That was -- been expressed to me by government officials and while the process, because of the due diligence thing is taking longer, is still on track. This environmental decree and I'm concerned that behind it was political motivations rather it\u2019s certainly not technical motivations. They're setting in the decree standards that don't apply to us as we speak, but set a timetable of six months that just can't be achieved.  We had an agreement with the government that over the life of the mine, we would retain 50% of the tailings own land. They are now saying it should be 95%, which just cannot be done. They set suspended solid standards that are actually lower than natural sediment standards that would go through the river system. I mean it's 200 versus an agreement that we've had for 20 years of 18,000. So this is not good news, but it's so out of bounds that I'm very confident we will get this done. It's just -- it's taken some work to do it, but it's not something that I've got you on a technical issue, it is a revisit of the whole system and you can't revisit a system that was agreed to 20 years ago and have been operating effectively over 20 years with no unexpected environmental consequences.  Benign tailings are being deposited in an area where they can be reclaimed. We grow agriculture projects there, the system needs drinking water standards. There's no impact on marine life. There's a thriving mud crab industry in the area, people fish offshore where we are and so this is a distraction, but you all know over time we have to deal with political issues and this is one of them. Lucas Pipes : Thank you very much for that and I noticed there's a Presidential election about 12 months from now. Do you think there's a risk that negotiations will continue to drag on and potentially reach a point where it just makes more sense to conclude them after a new President is elected? Richard Adkerson : Well, the presidential elections are -- will occur in 2019. There's regional elections that occur this year by the second half of this year. It will be in full swing campaigning and you have to say that that's a potential risk. It appears that the President would like to get this resolved before that. He's very popular. I mean, his favorable ratings are on the order of two-thirds. And he's done a good job in managing Indonesia, such a large diverse population and economy in a complicated world. So, but realistically, you have to say that that is a risk. We don't see anything to interfere with our operations.  The government needs and desires now to make sure that we operate and they collect their taxes in all of these and our positions about the long term are very clear. With where we are, it's important for us to continue to operate the rest of this year when we have such a favorable ore to process and profit from altogether and it's not just us, but it's the government also. It's a reality and a potential factor that we'll have to bring into play. We want to move this as quickly as possible and I know there are those in government who do as well. Lucas Pipes : Thank you very much, Richard and maybe one last one to squeeze in and to change the topic. You\u2019ve always been very focused on the Indonesia situation, but more recently, thinking a little bit more about growth and then restarting the dividend, from here on out, where do you think would you, outside of Indonesia kind of spend your focus, what is most important to you and to what extent does M&A also factor into those considerations? Thank you. Richard Adkerson : So you're correct about focus. I mean 2016 was a focus on de-leveraging, 2017 was a focus on Indonesia. By the fall, I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time with Red and his team who've been working all through this period in running our operations and looking at the future. And so I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in, when I was in Santiago talking with other companies about their plans, how people are sizing this up, what projects they have, when are they proceeding with them and so we are doing tradeoffs about basically two large projects right now and we have a series of others that will follow, but it's looking at the El Abra opportunity in Chile, which would be a major Cerro Verde type project with the added requirement for a salt water desalination plant and pipeline to take the water up to highs and we are 51% owner with Codelco. We met with Codelco people there.  They are positive about the project. They're going through changes right now with the change in government. And then our Bagdad mine in northwest Arizona is, read my winces, a more straightforward project because it's a basically mill expansion but we have to deal with tailings area and water, which we worked on for years. And so those are the two that we're teeing up and so what am I looking forward to is announcing the new projects, announcing, last time I said I was looking forward to increasing the dividend. The board did that right after our call and initiating the dividend and we are -- it's great to see a future of where we can build shareholder value out of these resources where we're not getting value today. We know we need to convert those resources in to cash flows.  We will get value. I'm very confident about the future of the copper business. That confidence is shared by my peers in the industry and so we feel a little great about it, we don't have to do anything right now. I mean, it's still a question with all these trade issues floating around. We need to see how those sort out. We're not, as a company, directly affected by. The copper is correlated to economic activity and these trade things affect economic activity. That's a factor. So feel really great about where we are, great about our company, our assets, our people and the direction we're going in and we'll always have issues to deal with like the Deep MLZ stuff and the best mine. I mean, you go back and look at all of big mines around the world that had times to deal with this, the great news is the resources there were a long term business and that resource is going to create value for our shareholders. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Company. Chris Mancini : First question is, just relative to your -- to the costs in North America and South America specifically, it looks like they're -- they crept up a little bit from last year and -- but it seems like there's some of it which should be somewhat temporary in terms of either lower grades or higher maintenance and repair costs. The big picture question is to what extent are you seeing kind of general mining inflation, to what extent is this temporary and then also to what extent is this like you were saying Richard catching up from not spending on maintenance capital in the past and if that is the case, how long would you expect to have to continue to kind of catch up. Richard Adkerson : Okay. So you start with the fact that a significant portion of our input costs are correlated with copper prices. That does make sense. You know you think about things that drive energy cost and steel cost and contractor cost and all those sorts of things, so our job is to find ways of mitigating these inherent increases by being more efficient. Red made a presentation about that at the Cisco conference in Santiago, go to that website and you can see what we're doing. We haven't bought, I mean, Caterpillar had great results today and it's always a key indicator for us. They are kind of an index on infrastructure spending around the world. But we haven't built a new truck. We haven\u2019t bought a new truck at Freeport since the financial crisis. We are rebuilding trucks. We're taking frames and component parts. We\u2019re extending the life of our tires. We're using all these sensors on all of our equipment that\u2019s feeding all this data in to systems that make us better able to control what operators are doing and how we do this. So you have this dynamic of input cost increasing, efficiencies have an impact on mitigating that and then the issues you pointed out about graves and so forth and that's going to go up and down within a relatively narrow range over time. Red Conger : In the short term, we're also increasing the mining and the production rate, those are kind of front end loaded cost wise before we really start to see the pounds coming out later in the year. So that's part of it. Richard Adkerson : That\u2019s right. El Abra was constrained, when prices were down. Sierrita was. Those mines are making money now and so we\u2019re having to spend some money to take advantage of that. Chris Mancini : So like so you're doing more shipping \u2013 Kathleen Quirk : And I was just going to say, we\u2019re not showing significant changes in our cash cost trajectory going forward. During 2015 and 2016, we took a lot of steps to maximize cash flows and we do have some catch up that we're doing, but we're operating now in more of a normal situation and so we don't -- we're not seeing a lot of cost increases or decreases in the near term, except for the kinds of things Richard talked about, the things that would be correlated with energy prices or other currencies or other movements that are correlated to the copper price. Richard Adkerson : And our current outlook for sustaining capital I think is a good longer term outlook. It\u2019s not something that's going to be increasing that, but we can't keep it at 500 million for an operation like this. It\u2019s going to be more in order of $1 billion a year. Chris Mancini : And then the second question is for Grasberg, on slide 23 of the presentation, you have your production outlook. How much will you need to be mining from the underground in order to achieve that guidance and how much are you mining now from the underground and so like I guess my question is what's your expected ramp rate from the underground and what are the real inherent risks to getting there and achieving this guidance. Kathleen Quirk : As Richard said, at the end of 2018, we expect to see some mining in the open pit. We will have some stockpiles that will mine, but those aren\u2019t anything of great significance for the long term. So really all of our production will start to come from the underground mines for operating the DOZ mine currently and the forecasts include roughly 40,000 tonnes a day from DOZ. Our Deep MLZ ramp up, we expect to ultimately get to 80,000 tonnes a day from that mine and right now our projection is we\u2019ll get there in the 2021, 2022 timeframe. And in the Grasberg block cave, we will be ramping that up and we expect to get to roughly 100,000 tonnes a day from that mine in 2022 and the ultimate production from that mine we expect to be in the 130,000 to 160,000 tonnes per day range.  But in terms of the Deep MLZ and the Grasberg block cave combined by 2020, from those two mines, we would expect to average about 70,000 to 75,000 pounds a day combined in 2020 on average versus in capacity, which will be 80 plus 130. So something on the order of 200. We do have and Mark Johnson is on the line and he can comment about this. We do have, in the Grasberg block cave, access to higher grade material in the earlier years. So even though we're in a ramp up period, we still will have the benefit of accessing some higher grade material from that orebody. As Richard said, it\u2019s the same orebody as our Grasberg open pit, just a different mining method. But Mark, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to the comments about the ramp up? Mark Johnson : Yeah. Fortunately, the highest grade ore in these ore bodies is also the most capable. So it makes sense that we start there from both an economic and a mining method approach. As Kathleen said, in the early years of Grasberg, it\u2019s well above the ore body average. We're well above 1.1% copper and one gram, 1.2 grams for much of that ramp up period. The same for the Deep MLZ, we have exceptional grades, we start off in 1.6 copper and about 1.6 gram per tonne gold. So both of those are -- offset the lower tonnes as we wrap up and then as we get up to a steady state on the production rate over about a 5 or 6 year period at the Grasberg and we expect the same with the deep MLZ after we get the seismic event or seismic situation resolved.  These ramp up rates are what we were able to do in the DOZ 10 years ago as we ramped up. So a lot of the ramp up is based on how quickly you can advance the undercut. You concurrently develop the extraction level, which is the drop bells and sequencing of the mine over the long term. So these are things that we've done in the past with the DOZ and we're applying. We've got better construction techniques now. As far as the overflow systems, going forward, Richard mentioned that a lot of the infrastructure that we have now is dated as we shut down the pit, much of that older system is mothballed and will be relying on, the majority of the ore flow system will be brand new systems that we built for both Deep MLZ and GBC.  So we'll be starting fresh with new infrastructure that's all been done at a very high standard. So we're very optimistic on the ramp up of both of those mines, both the Deep MLZ and GBC. Big Gossan also, smaller mine but very high grade. It's about 2.5% copper equivalent and we're ramping it up also, it has the potential about 100 million pounds a year and about 60,000 ounces, not a large mine for PT-FI, but still a very significant contributor to what we're doing in the future in the underground. Chris Mancini : Okay. Got it. Okay. So in 2020, because of the higher grades, you only have to do 70,000 tonnes per day from the DMLZ and the Grasberg block cave combined and then as you ramp up the throughput from the underground to 2021 and 2022, the grades will decline and that allows you to achieve the -- and then eventually even 2023, you should even see a bigger increase in -- or as you progress in 2023 and beyond, a bigger increase in throughput. And should production increase in 2023 and beyond or will grades like continue to decline because it's fairly steady? Mark Johnson : It's fairly steady. We get up to that 200 plus 200,000 tonne plus range that Kathleen mentioned. And then the grades in the Grasberg steady for quite a while. We end up with a little bit higher grade towards the end again. So it's somewhat variable, but we've got a long term outlook that shows, as you know, very much over 1 billion tonnes a year and gold very. We've got slides I know that we\u2019ve shown in the past that show the underground era and it's in that 1.5 million ounce range longer term. Kathleen Quirk : Yeah. And that\u2019s 100%. So we would have 50% of that. Richard Adkerson : So, our reference slides have that. I mean we\u2019re just casually mentioning an underground operation feeding 200,000, to 240,000 tonnes per day of ore to a mill. I mean, I thought that others in the industry and people are just, they're just amazed by -- it's the infrastructure there is truly amazing. So first time ever and we're very confident with it. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Oscar Cabrera with CIBC. Oscar Cabrera : I'm just going to start with your development projects. I must admit that until you started focusing on Lone Star and realize that the resource grade was 0.61%. So as you're looking at the future of the company, with El Abra and Lone Star, could you comment on what do you think is, you look at the projects and what's more favorable to you? Is it all of the advantages that they have in the US or is it, if it's really now with requirements for this on that, so like taken on the list. Richard Adkerson : Well, that's what we're trying to decide. I mean, it's in some ways comparable. 11 years ago, when we bought Phelps Dodge and we looked at El Abra, all we could see was the oxide project and a sulfide project and that was it. We drilled these core holes, found this enormous resource and now we're working to take advantage of it. People have known about Lone Star going back to the 1960s. And now we're drilling it and we're getting real stars in our eyes about how really big this thing could be. I mean, we're talking about something that might could well be over the years another Morenci type deposit. But that's going to take some time.  We're going to evaluate that. We have, as I said, a much more straightforward expansion project available to us at Bagdad and that's where the tradeoffs that you're talking about really come into place, lower energy costs in the US, no labor unions, much flexible ability to adjust the work force, communities that provide education, healthcare, housing for people as opposed to our having to do all that, workers driving their forward trucks to work with a lunch pail, it is -- all of those things add up to making investment in the US relatively more attractive than it's ever been. And so that's what we\u2019re doing those tradeoffs for and the Lone Star deal is more of a bigger picture longer timeframe type asset, but it is going to create a lot of value for Freeport shareholders. Oscar Cabrera : Thanks, Richard. And then before I ask you the next question, it might be worthwhile just starting like a cross section of the Lone Star sulfite just to get context and then lastly just a clarification on your comments on your discussions with the Indonesia Ministry of Environment, are they expecting changes in six months? Is that the part of the discussion, because I don't -- this is not realistic and as you said, might be politically motivated, but can you provide a little bit more context on those discussions? Richard Adkerson : Well I am as perplexed as you are and we're having dialog, we\u2019ll continue to have dialog, not only with the environmental and forestry ministry, but with the ministers that are working directly with us on our contract situation. So this is -- we were not expecting these decrees. I had to tell you about them because they cannot be put in place. It\u2019s not just Freeport, nobody can mine this one body in consistency with these two decrees. You just physically can't do it. So it's some of the noise that happens from time to time and we\u2019re going to deal with this in a constructive dialog to explain. I've already -- we've already doing that, to explain the situation and talk about what realistically is do or not. It's addressing a problem that isn't there. There's no problem here. Oscar Cabrera : Well, that's what it sounds like. Richard Adkerson : Benign tailings that are being managed as we said we would and nobody can identify impacts of significance that weren't anticipated. It all almost goes back to the issue, are you going to develop the mine or not, because there was no way to store tailings up in those mountains and we look at every conceivable alternative. I mean, we had experts from Indonesia and around the world. It\u2019s a public process. The Indonesian environment minister at the time said, it was the most comprehensive environmental study ever done in Indonesia and we all said okay, this is the way we're going to do it, this is the way we've done it. So anyway, I had to tell you about it, I'm confident that this is going to be dealt with. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Alex Hacking : Sorry to keep harping on Indonesia, but a couple of questions if I may. You talked about the Ministry there trying to impose new environmental standards, but there's also been reports in the local press about them making a very substantial claim for damages. I think it's been reported around $13 billion, something like that. Are those press reports accurate? And is that an official claim from that ministry, legal claim or is this just? Richard Adkerson : No. This came about because of governmental audit group that\u2019s in some ways not totally like our GAO. It was a centralized audit group that came in and that claim is based on degradation to the tailings deposition area. Their take is a large area of land and they say that area was degradated by environmental impact. Of course, it was. I mean we had over 2.5 billion tonnes of ore to process, take the concentrate out, deposit of tailings somewhere and that's where we did it. Now to come back and say, okay, you've got to pay some financial form for doing something that the government approved, it is outrageous. Kathleen Quirk : They haven\u2019t presented any kind of claim. It\u2019s in their report to these government ministries of what a number of what and potential environmental damage can be, so it\u2019s just a number, it\u2019s not a \u2013 Richard Adkerson : An academic group did a theoretical study to say what happened with this tailings deposition and they used some approaches to measure environmental damage that\u2019s huge around the world, but it's not something that is outside of what was approved. It\u2019s strictly in this designated deposition area, where we built dikes to cordon it off and agreed that\u2019s what we're going to put, these millions of tonnes of tailings and that's what we're doing. Alex Hacking : Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s very clear and very helpful. And then just a follow up on the deep MLZ, are you considering any impact there of the slowdown beyond 2019 and I noticed when you look at the guidance, you expect to make up for the slowdown beyond 2019, but I guess at a practical level, how is that going to happen, because it's \u2013 Richard Adkerson : Deep MLZ, some of the makeup is from what Mark was talking to you about with the Grasberg block cave. So you're looking at the total production, which includes Deep MLZ and the Grasberg block cave and to a smaller degree the Big Gossan. Now, the unfortunate thing about this unexpected occurrence was the Deep MLZ, because of what Mark said having this 1.6% copper grades available to us, when we look back couple of years ago and saw this coming, we said will this previously expected fall off in 2019, it was earlier years then, which is going to be offset by this ore from Deep MLZ. Now, we've had the seismic events and that's been pushed back. So we have to be candid. We're dealing with this, there's some uncertainty as to how long it's going to take to get this block cave operating in a way of where the seismic events are not of the nature that they create risk to our people. We have a plan, we're going to report to you how that plan goes over time, but it's all dependent on the timing for that and you can appreciate, we're being very conservative with it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Novid Rassouli with Cowen & Company. Novid Rassouli : So touching on kind of what you were just stating, the deep MLZ, you guys took down your mining profile out to like 2022 if we look at kind of what you guys had last quarter. Is that just the mining, the seismic activity, bringing down all the out years as well or what's the driver of that? Kathleen Quirk : Well if you look at the slide for the five years of slide 23, the actual total production over that period net to PT-FI\u2019s interest is 5.4 billion pounds of copper, which is similar to what we had. I think we had 5.3 in our last plan over that period of time. And gold is similar to what we had in the last quarterly update. But what we're seeing is a shift out of 2019 and the outer years are higher than what our plan was because Deep MLZ is shifted out, as Mark said, that the beginning of the year, beginning production ramp up of Deep MLZ has higher grade. So that shift would just continue to shift it out and then also with the progress that we've made on the Grasberg Block Cave and the position we\u2019re in in terms of the commencement of the cave in early 2019, those two factors combined bring us to where we've got better, over the long term, it's essentially the same as where we were before, but we do have this impact in 2019 that at this point, our mine plans don't show being able to make up and we're going to continue to work on that. Novid Rassouli : Got it. That makes sense. And then looking at your CapEx, it looks like you reduced your spend for the long term PT-FI investments plans to 0.8 billion from 0.9. However, net to PT-FI remained at 0.7 billion. Would you mind us running through why the net to PT-FI number doesn't change despite the CapEx number decreasing? Thanks. Richard Adkerson : Some of this is rounding. In other words, we give numbers that are rounded. Kathleen Quirk : Yeah. We did reduce -- over the five years, we did reduce 100% Grasberg CapEx by about 300 million associated with the timing of power requirements and as Richard said, in terms of the sharing mechanisms that\u2019s going to be in the large part rounding, but some of the projects we share differently than others, so we can talk to you offline if you want more over the top into it. Richard Adkerson : I mean we have this ongoing process of where all -- our whole team is looking at this question, I\u2019m saying that there are ways to do it cheaper better, do we have to do it now, can we defer it, it's all part of maximizing the economics of the operation and that\u2019s ongoing. Fundamentally, nothing that\u2019s changed. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Maybe one last one on Indonesia hopefully, but just going back to that Ministry of Environment and Forestry issue. So just to clarify, so obviously, you\u2019re mentioning it could very well be political, you're saying that technologically it may not be feasible. Within that, are we basically saying here that even if, I mean, that the statement was saying that it has to be a six month transitional period, even if the government came out and said, you know what, we\u2019ll give you 24 months of 30 months or whatever. Your space is still saying that it could be done. Does that mean that theoretically worst case scenario that production line to a halt or does it mean that production potentially is going to come down 50% of what, what is the kind of the operational outcome in the worst case scenario here? Richard Adkerson : I want to clarify something you just said. You said may not be achievable, I want to be clear. It is not achievable. There's no may about it. It cannot be done within six months, 24 months, 5 years. This is so far out of bounce. It cannot be done. And as I said, it's addressing a problem that doesn't exist. It's -- the reason I say politically, it's a revisit of the decision that was made back in the 1990s, are you going to develop this mine. I mean, we look at pipelines, we look at sea disposal, we look to build a pipeline on the other side of the mountain, we cannot store these tailings in the mountains.  And the question of this stopping operations, it's not going to happen. Indonesia is looking to relying on the financial benefits that\u2019s coming out of this mine to deal with this budgetary issues. The taxes, the royalties that they are receiving is on the order of $40 billion I think over the life of the mine and the province needs this economic impact. This is a province that doesn't have a lot of jobs, that won't have economic development. We are 95% of the economy of the Regency of Mimika.  And so this is not going to stop our operations. It's a matter of education. I'm proud of the way we run this environmental thing. I expressed that to the ministers in Washington last week. We don't need to be defensive about this. We are managing these environmental issues in an admirable way, so we can show that it can be reclaimed, we can show that we're meeting drinking water standards that were -- we have land that was appropriate fertilizer can ultimately become crop land. And so there's nothing to be defensive about. There's no possibility that this is something that is going to disrupt our operations. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. David Gagliano : A lot of mine have already been answered, but one different question I had. Year-end 2018, kind of I guess a nitpicky question, net debt targets for year-end 2018 eighteen increased, it was 4.8 billion previously, now, it\u2019s 5.5 billion. If I look at the differences, I think dividend working capital changes account for about 200 million of that increase, lower CapEx is about 100 million swing in the other direction. So I\u2019m just trying to reconcile what caused the other increase of about 600 million to the targeted net debt figure for 2018. Kathleen Quirk : Which case you're looking at Dave. David Gagliano : I'm comparing the 4Q slide on net debt target by year end 2018. Kathleen Quirk : But which price sale. David Gagliano : To the page 17 on this slide deck year end \u2013 Kathleen Quirk : So part of it is we didn't get 325 all year, right, I mean, we\u2019ve already through part of the year and we\u2019re less than that. Also the previous slide was before we did our dividend. So this is net of the dividend. The other differences are the differences in the operating cash flow changes that we, that are on a previous slide. So we can walk you through it, but the main thing -- the main difference from what case you're looking at is we didn't get 325. This includes actual to the first quarter and estimates for the balance of the year based on these prices. And then we didn't have a dividend in the last case. Richard Adkerson : So Dave, David Joint will call you and walk you through analysis on that, but there is nothing there other than what we just talked about for the rest of the group. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Michael Dudas : I'll try to make it brief. Good morning. Just two quick questions first. Now that the environmental issues that you discussed during the call are out in the open, what can we look for as a milestone or timing to figure out how things are working out just on that issue specifically and how it\u2019s licensed to the overall discussion regarding the potential transactions? Richard Adkerson : So I've expressed a concern that these environmental issues represent a distraction from going forward with a plan we\u2019re working on. And so we have to deal with that. And at this point, the milestone will be making sure that the ministers we're doing with on the broader issue understand what this is and what this isn\u2019t and so we're engaged in that education process right now. I mean we\u2019ve presented written, had meetings and I'm reaching out to meet with the environmental minister to deal with this. I just have to tell you, this just came up. I mean, when was it, it was last week. Yeah. Mid-April. So you're getting this as we've got and we've got to respond to it. So I just want to keep coming back, it's addressing a problem that doesn't exist. Michael Dudas : That's very helpful. And just my final call Richard. When you think about the planned Freeport 2.0 once Indonesia gets resolved, is there going to be acceleration on the plans you're talking about in Latin America and North America from a capital growth standpoint or you do need to wait to resolve Indonesia to really get yourselves set to track those plans or is it better just to harvest things before if you get some clarity on the other hand. Thank you. Richard Adkerson : I will say this. I don't think given the improvement we have in our balance sheet and given where we are with Indonesia, that it's a factor, but it's not a major constraint and what we decide to do going forward. We certainly have the financial capability of doing it. Quite frankly, we're not out looking for partners in this thing. We already have a partner at Codelco, Codelco and El Abra. We are -- there's nothing compelling us to act quickly. But as we get the clarity that I think we need to have is on the global economic situation and this trade issue was a curveball for everybody and that's obviously every day -- debated every day in the paper about whether that's going to be a negotiating strategy to deal with some obvious issues in China for competition or is it going to lead to a tit for tat deal that's going to have a significant global impact.  But to me, that's the big issue. You scrape that away and look at the underlying numbers, China grew at 6.8%, business in the US is really good, our customers feel good, Europe and even Japan is growing. I mean that's first time we've had this and I feel people in the industry that never seen, I've been around this industry now for a very long time. I\u2019ve been CEO for 15 years. I've never seen a more positive outlook going into a year as we had in 2018 and then we get this trade deal that's got people scratching their heads. It clearly had an impact on investor flows and that affects prices at any point in time, but there's nothing in the underlying economies that changes.  Nothing has changed the supply situation. There's -- and even these projects that people are considering are so long term and they're just going to be needed because we can\u2019t talk about having a need for 4.5 million tonnes of copper capacity over the next ten years and when you \u2013 and that's about the size of the top ten copper mines in the world and so the world's going to need this copper and increasingly every day, you read about people wanting to move more towards electric vehicles and alternative energy sources, electric vehicles three four times more copper, alternative energy sources is four times more copper than conventional power generation and then you've got all the support that goes on with that. I mean this is a good outlook for demand and the best thing about copper is there is supply constraint. You\u2019ve got Codelco facing challenges to maintaining production. [indiscernible] I'm a believer and I think there is consensus now. Richard Adkerson : Thank you all of you. We appreciate it and we look forward to reporting on this -- on our progress and milestones as we go forward. Appreciate your interest in our company. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slide materials for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the conference call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2017 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. On the call today, Richard Adkerson, our Chief Executive Officer; Red Conger, who heads up our Americas business; Mark Johnson, who oversees our Indonesian operations; Mike Kendrick, who heads up our molybdenum business. I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be reviewing our recent performance and outlook using the slide materials on our website. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for questions. Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $869 million or $0.59 per share for the second quarter of 2018. Excluding net credits of $16 million recorded in the quarter or $0.01 per share, our adjusted net income totaled $853 million or $0.58 per share. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was just above $2.1 billion, and we've got a reconciliation of the EBITDA calculations on page 29 of our slide materials. We sold copper in the quarter of 989 million pounds, our gold volumes were 676,000 ounces and molybdenum sales totaled 24 million pounds. They were higher than our estimates in terms of copper that primarily reflected higher mining and milling rates and higher ore grades in Indonesia. Gold sales were slightly lower than our estimate, primarily because of quarter end timing of shipments in Indonesia, but they were substantially higher than the 2017 sales of 432,000 ounces, reflecting the high grades of ore that we're mining at Grasberg. At the second quarter 2018, average realized price for copper was $3.08 per pound. That was 16% above the year ago quarter average price. And gold prices averaged $1,274 per ounce. Those were also above the year ago period average price of $1,243 per ounce. Our average net unit cash costs for the quarter, and that's net of byproduct credits on a consolidated basis, was $0.96 per pound of copper for the quarter. That reflected strong performance from our global operations and continued focus on productivity and cost management. During the quarter, we generated $1.3 billion of operating cash flows. Those were cash flows net of taxes, net of interest costs. And those exceeded our capital expenditures, which were just below $500 million. We continued to strengthen our balance sheet during the quarter. Our consolidated cash totaled $3.9 billion at June 30 and our consolidated debt totaled $11.1 billion. That total debt number is down $2 billion since the start of the year. Net debt at June 30, approximately $7.3 billion, and that was over $1 billion less than at the beginning of the year. As you saw in the first quarter, our board reinstated a cash dividend on common stock and we declared a dividend of $0.05 per share under this new policy that will be paid on August 1. I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be reviewing our results and outlook and referring to the slide presentation materials on our website. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. I'm briefly going to go through this overview material and then address your questions. The positive second quarter results that Kathleen referred to reflected our team's focus on productivity, cost management, capital discipline, well ahead of last year's quarter when we were affected by regulatory issues from the government on exports and labor issues, but we basically met our targets. We would have exceeded them, but for some weather delays and shipping concentrate out of PT-FI, which happens to us from time to time. Kathleen noted our positive debt reduction activities. You may recall that 18 months ago, we set a target to reduce our $20 billion plus debt at that time by $5 billion to $10 billion by the end of 2018 and now, we're at $7.3 billion. We previously announced this Heads of Agreement that we've entered into with the state-owned company in Indonesia, Inalum, and Rio Tinto on July 12, which establishes a way forward to resolve our issues related to the long-term stability of operations in Indonesia. And we're going to talk about the advancement we're making with our Lone Star project here in Arizona. First, couple of comments about copper markets. Sentiment in mid-June turned significantly negative for commodities including copper, all tied into this trade issues that we're dealing with internationally now. Copper is down 14% since June 15 after rising, many other commodities are also down. As we sit here today, there is an anomaly between market sentiment and fundamentals in the marketplace. We're continuing to see real demand being very positive for our global business, including our business in China. The physical markets are broadly balanced globally. Exchange stocks are actually down since mid-June, and supply growth continues to be muted. Wood Mackenzie said today's copper price is 15% below the real price that's needed from an incentive basis to develop new production, so we're likely continue to see underinvestment continuing, which this continues to build this long, mid-term positive outlook for copper. And increasingly, it's clear that future copper demand is going to benefit significantly from the development of renewable energy projects being undertaken all around the world and the development of electric vehicles. All of this is in a context of declining ore grades from producing mines and a real lack of actionable projects expected to be contained in the \u2013 for future supply. So absent having some sort of global recession or major setback in China, market deficits in the copper appear to be inevitable. And I'll just make a quick note on China's actions in the last few days to loosen its fiscal situation in this country to continue to support continued investment. We don't do this very often, but I'm going to give a call out to Wood Mackenzie on their June 2018 report. It is excellent. I mean it sounds like I'm talking in an echo chamber when I read this thing, so I refer that to you and just answer any questions that I might be able to offer to any questions you might have. We previously announced this Heads of Agreement on July 12. It points to a new long-term positive partnership between our company and the government of Indonesia and that's a long time coming. It does not represent a final resolution in that we have to have a consummation of a series of agreements. But all of this is envisioned by the agreements, understandings that we've reached in the Heads of Agreement. From our standpoint, it would achieve our long-term, our goal for long-term stability for our Grasberg operations with stabilized fiscal and legal terms that would be legally enforceable, and importantly with the way this thing has developed over the past year, this structure allows us as FCX to retain our current existing economics. It preserves our share of cash flows and our net asset values, is not diluted to FCX shareholders. You may recall last August, we were looking at a situation where we're going to have to divest a significant part of our interest with Rio Tinto's decision to exit. This allows us to avoid that, and it will allow us to continue to manage the operations. This is something that I'm really looking forward to. It would create a strong alignment of interest between the Indonesian government, through this state-owned enterprise, Inalum, the local governments in Papua, and our company. So going forward, we'd all be working together. Now what does that mean? Regulatory issues are likely to be much less of a barrier, issues dealing with local communities are likely to improve, issues related to security, to regulatory changes, to all the things that have been distractions, sometimes barriers to us, and it would be positive for all the parties. We're working on definitive agreements. We'll say expect it to close in the second half of 2018. Indonesian government officials are talking about a quicker closing. Our operations were really exceptional. Our team in Papua has just done a great job in dealing with all the issues there. Our mill rate was 188,000 tons per day with plus 1% copper and 1.77% gold which shows you the quality of this ore body. We are \u2013 while we're continuing the construction of this underground infrastructure to allow us to move forward beyond the Grasberg open pit, we've had really strong reduction, the second quarter unit net cash cost was a negative $0.77. That means the gold component of our concentrate more than funded our total operating cost and we paid $1.6 billion \u2013 PT-FI paid $1.6 billion of dividend. Now, we have some mine plan adjustments that are reflected in the numbers we'll be talking about. Part of this has to do with our efforts to deal with the seismic events in our Deep MLZ mine, which we commenced last year. We've run into some harder, more competent rock there that's led to these mining into seismic events. We're being very cautious with these about safety, and so we're undertaking a remedial program to be able to mine this resource in a safe way. And our current plan calls for us, and we're underway with this right now, to drill holes to allow us to use water to frac this competent material, which our plan indicates would lead to the initiation of caving in a normal way. It's going to take some time, and so we have reflected that in our plans. But we've got a global team working with us. We're confident this will be done. It's been done in South America successfully. And so it's not affecting the resource itself. It's just a question of starting it up and ramping it up. In light of that, we undertook a study of our open pit operations and we're announcing today that we're going to extend operations from the open pit through the first half of next year 2019, attractive economics and allows us to accelerate production that otherwise would have gone through the Grasberg Block Cave. I want to make sure that everyone understands that this Deep MLZ mine is a separate mine from the Grasberg Block Cave. The Grasberg Block Cave is an extension of the same ore body we've been mining from the surface that we now will be mining underground in block cave. We know that ore body very well and its rock characteristics are similar to what we've dealt with in the open pit and will not be the same as this competent rock we're operating with the Deep MLZ mine. The Deep MLZ mine is an extension of underground mineralization that we started mining into, and there's a schematic on page 23, that we began mining in the early 1980s actually, but now it's at significant depth. The Deep MLZ mine is at 1,500 meters to 1,800 meters underground. The Grasberg Block Cave is 300 meters to 400 meters underground because of the pit being taken out of it. And we just run into some harder rock. It's going to take us longer to ramp it up. Think of it this way. We're basically completing a mine, Grasberg open pit, and now we're starting like a new development with the underground ore bodies that we have at the Deep MLZ and the Grasberg Block Cave. Over a five-year period, the amount of copper and gold that we'll recover is virtually the same, but it will delay the start-up of the Deep MLZ. The bulk of the capital will be spent in developing new infrastructure during this time period, and so this is where we are on page 7. You see that we will have a transition years in 2019 and 2020, and ramp up beginning at the end of 2020, so that by 2022, we would be in full production from our underground mining system with over 200,000 tons a day through the mill. Volumes are high this year as we complete mining in the open pit going into next year. And after transition years by 2022, we will be up to sustainable rates that would last through 2041 with little capital to be spent on infrastructure development, and the only capital then would be in the ongoing development of the underground caves. Now, we're going to be talking more in the future about the resources that our company has available to it outside Indonesia. Understandably, investor focus has been on the issues in Indonesia because of the size of that asset and the situation we've had with the government. But we want to make sure everyone understands just how great this company has in resources in the Americas, and the level of profitable production we're having now, and also the future that we have for our development in North America and South America. We are currently engaged as we've previously talked about in developing a oxide resource at the Lone Star deposit, adjacent to our Safford mining infrastructure and very near our big Morenci mine in Eastern Arizona. We have 4.4 billion pounds of copper reserves, only oxide. We're spending capital over time that will aggregate $850 million. We commenced pre-stripping earlier this year and this stripping is going to provide us exposure to a very large sulfide deposit that lies underneath this oxide deposit, very low execution risk. It's basically almost like strip mining, stripping of a resource, but it's going to be profitable and that oxide ore can be taken to our facilities that are in existence and underutilized at Safford and we'll make money out of it as you can see on page 8. Now, we have continued to drill the sulfide resource underneath this oxide deposit that we're developing. We have six rigs going there now. You can see the results of core holes that we had during the second quarter. And this is very attractive mineralization for this area and for North America in general. This resource continues to get larger. It has the potential over time of becoming another Morenci. I don't say that with anything other than seriousness and we are very excited about this. It will take time to get to it, but in terms of looking at what's ahead for our company to have this opportunity right in the midst of our existing operations in Arizona with a favorable regulatory environment that we have here in our established positive relationships with the local communities and the Native American community, this is a real positive for our company. Outside of Lone Star in North America at Bagdad our Chino/Cobre operations in New Mexico. The Morenci mine itself and at Sierrita, we have significant undeveloped resources and we're evaluating those for future development. In South America, we're focused on a tremendous opportunity we have with our partner, Codelco, at our El Abra mine where we have again a very large sulfide resource to look at. We have this large footprint at Cerro Verde. In our meeting last week, you guys gave me an exciting piece of core from Cerro Verde as we do in drilling there. We're studying this now. We have no plans to commence a major project in the current environment, but we're preparing for that and we have a very large portfolio within the company with many options to consider what's going to be our future steps for expanding the company's resources. Turning to Slide 11. Our sales outlook for copper, gold, molybdenum are unchanged. Our unit cost are essentially in order in line with what we had predicted earlier, what we forecast earlier, and our operating cash flows at $2.75 copper would be $4.3 billion if we meet our plan. Obviously, this is affected by what we reported last quarter at $3.15 copper. We're very levered. I mean that leverage goes both ways. It's for each $0.10 change in copper price for the remainder of this year to $185 million of operating cash flow to this. Capital expenditures are unchanged. Page 12 shows our profile for our copper and gold sales. For the year, you can see, 2019 will be a transition year as will 2020. And at the end of that, our plans call for us to be in full productive mode as we go forward. Page 13 shows the EBITDA and cash flow slide that we show each year. We've done something a little different each quarter. We've done something a little different this quarter. In the first block, we show what those numbers, EBITDA and cash flow numbers, would be at different copper prices, ranging from $3 to $3.50. That's in line with the current forward sales prices, and showing what the average would be for 2019 and 2020. And then showing what the average would be as we transition to the ramp up of our underground mines in 2021 and 2022, and you can see the significant difference that that makes. But we want to make sure you saw the full range of this at varying copper prices and $1,250 gold and $11 molybdenum. Capital expenditures are shown on the left, slide 14. They are not changed from previous quarter. Our financial policy is still focused on strengthening our balance sheet. As I mentioned, we've made significant \u2013 more than significant progress over the past 18 months. And we believe we'll be in positive markets going forward and we continue to improve our balance sheet. We have a disciplined approach to invest in attractive growth projects. We're going to be driven by value. I mean we're not growing just for the sake of growing. That makes no sense. But we have the chance to invest over time in a way that will add value to our company. These resources receive very little value in today's stock prices. As we are successful in finding ways to invest in a disciplined way in low cost expansion projects, that's going to create cash flows and values for our company. We really have a strong team to execute this strategy. We're focused on all aspects of the copper business. And our team has proven itself throughout the world in being able to develop and operate resources in challenging circumstances across the breadth of investments and operations in the copper business. We're going to be driven by returns to shareholder. Our board and management team is totally focused on creating value for shareholders, and I want to emphasize this, in a disciplined way. The industry has learned a lot of lessons in recent years and that discipline extends across the industry, and all of that does is add for more support for future supplies. So we reinstated a dividend. We expect to be in a position over time to increase that dividend. We have to see what these trade issues mean for the world's economy. My hope and the hope, I think, of a lot of people throughout American industry is that it's a strategy to deal with specific issues and it doesn't result in an all-out trade wars that results in serious implications to the economy, but we have to see what happens with that. It's uncertain. We view this financial policy at every board meeting. There's a number of reference slides here that are available for your future review. We may use some of them in answering questions. But with that, Regina, I'd like to turn the call over to questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question will come from the line of Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew Korn - Goldman Sachs : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Hey, Matthew. Matthew Korn - Goldman Sachs : So we noticed in the guidance changes here in Grasberg, we noticed a little bit of a pushback tilting away from 2021 or from 2019 and 2020, a little bit towards 2022. Is that largely DMLZ? Are there other challenges? Is this essentially tied to the slide 7, where you look through and you're showing us the changes in the ore milled per day? How does that all fit together? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: It's Deep MLZ. I mean, if you go back for several years now, we've been developing this Deep MLZ with the expectation that it would be ramping up actually in 2016, 2017, and it has very high grades available to us. And as we got into mining that ore body, we encountered unexpectedly harder rock than we had experienced as we've mined the same ore mineralization area for years. And the original mine, Mark, was the GBT and the Intermediate Ore Zone, the Deep Ore Zone, and now the Deep MLZ. We got the Deep MLZ. It's much further underground and the rock is harder, and we started running into these seismic events, which happen other places in the industry. It causes us to be cautious. We've got a plan now to use water to frac this ore body to prepare it for caving. And so that whole thing is driven by that one factor. Everything else is going fine, everything else. But as we saw this being pushed out now to 2021, as always, we start looking at ways to mitigate that. And we found a step to mitigate that by extending the life of the Grasberg open pit, mining some very high-grade ore into the first half of next year, and what you see is the net effect of that. A deferral of the Deep MLZ and a continuation of mining from the open pit and the numbers you see are the net of those two. And I want to just keep coming back and emphasizing this because I read articles in the press as we all do and we want to make sure that people understand that this is a different rock environment, different rock characteristics than the rock it will be mining in the Grasberg Block Cave. As I said, that's just an extension of the same ore body that we've been mining since the early 1990s and we've drilled, Mark, thousands of holes into it? Mark J. Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And so we really understand that and don't expect this problem that we have in the Deep MLZ to be experienced in the Grasberg Block Cave. Matthew Korn - Goldman Sachs : Got it. I appreciate the clarity because we saw, when you listed your near-term objectives there in the block cave over the next year, all that seemed like that had held in place. Let me ask you... Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah, I just... Matthew Korn - Goldman Sachs : Yeah. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Let me just mention one thing. We've had a series of milestones in the development of Grasberg Block Cave including this week. This week for the first time we've delivered ore from that block cave through our ore delivery system that is using a train system, first time we've done that and we've actually this week delivered ore from the block cave to the mill. So through all of this stuff with export bans and negotiations with the government and all these other things, this team has just been relentless in developing this infrastructure and has achieved milestone after milestone. So we're ready to go. And like I said, it's like finishing up. It happens to be mined in the same mineral district. But this is like totally finishing up one mine and starting up a new one. And that ramp up is just like people face in starting up new mines in Mongolia or in Arizona or anywhere else. So it's \u2013 you need to think of it in that context. Matthew Korn - Goldman Sachs : All right. Got it. That's very clear. Let me then ask in context of all that's been negotiated with the Indonesian government, still needs to be finalized, how does this work with the aim to maintain the cash flows through and over the next five-year period as they were under the existing JV. For example, if there's more issue with the Deep MLZ, you're still working through, you're still developing the mine plan. If there's more slippage and some of these mined areas that are part of the plan you don't get to until 2023, is there a risk that you would lose some of that attributable copper or would it still be based on, no, we're not in the mining sections yet in which the additional stream under the JV would activate if that makes sense? Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Matthew, this is Kathleen. The economics of the Rio Tinto deal, joint venture will carry forward under the new structure. So there's a certain quantity of metal as you know that is 100% for PT-FI's interest and then the increment produced above that is shared 60-40 between PT-FI and Rio Tinto. And so that would continue that PT-FI, the existing shareholders of PT-FI would continue to have the 100% of specific volumes whenever they're produced. And currently that's expected to be produced by the end of 2022. So we're not expecting a change in this new structure and we're working with our new partner to make sure that those cash flows go to the existing PT-FI shareholders. And then the new shares that they'll get, they'll have 40% after a certain period of time. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So let me \u2013 thanks, Kathleen. Let me tell you how we're doing that. With Rio Tinto, there was a joint venture that was going to continue 2041. Rio Tinto never owned shares in PT-FI, never talked about owning shares in PT-FI. The government wants to own shares in PT-FI. And so in a step to cooperating with the government achieving its interest, we agree to convert that to 2041 \u2013 I mean to shares, but there would be a dividend agreement that we will receive dividends with respect to those shares until this Rio Tinto cutoff date would have been reached. Matthew Korn - Goldman Sachs : Got it. Thanks very much, folks. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead. Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everybody. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Hey, Lucas. Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: I wanted to follow-up a little bit more. I know you spoke about this both in your prepared remarks and just in the previous question, but can you maybe elaborate a little bit on what's driving the increase in 2022 from that $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion on the gold side? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: It's just the \u2013 it's the ramp up. It's the ramp up and whether that ramp up was going to start earlier, it's going to start now. It's very high grades of copper and gold in this Deep MLZ, and so we just shifted the ramp up time. It's nothing more than that. Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: And then so \u2013 but can you explain to me what's driving the specific, the increase from 2022 out, should it continue to operate at this higher level or is it really kind of a one-year balance in 2022? Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, we show a five-year estimate on that ramp up slide, so you can see what the next five years look like on an aggregate basis, and you can see it's pretty similar. In 2022, we reached 103,000 tons a day average for the Grasberg Block Cave. That'll increase to the 130,000 ton to 160,000 ton range. So the Grasberg Block Cave will become the largest part of our production profile after that. But really what you're seeing in terms of this shift to 2022 has to do with what Richard just said that we have higher grades at Deep MLZ earlier on and those have been shifted from 2020 to 2021, 2022 and then Grasberg Block Cave kicks in and will start increasing. That's why you see on a five-year average after 2022, it remains very similar. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: But in the aggregate, there's not any spike here. There is not a spike here like you suggested. We build up to full production level, 200,000 plus tons through the mill that essentially extends through 2041 and with very high grades of copper and gold and all of this will now be within PT-FI. We'll have 50% of the shares of PT-FI. So half of it is ours, half of it is government. Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: That's very helpful. Thank you for that. And maybe one more follow-up. When I look at the transition year 2019 3.3 billion pounds and then that kind of ramping up, on an average 2020 through 2022, to 4 billion pounds, could you maybe disaggregate a little bit, I know you break down the Grasberg production in greater detail in the later slides of the presentation, but from an aggregate production level, would it be possible to break down 2020, 2021 and 2022 in a little bit more detail. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: 2021 and 2022 are similar, and this is PT-FI, this is FCX consolidated under the current scheme at about 4.2 billion pounds and 2021 at this stage, I mean 2020 at this stage is 3.5 billion pounds. Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Got it. I very much appreciate it and best of luck. Thank you. Operator : Our next question... Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So just to give you a quick flavor on that. The Deep MLZ in 2020 should be around 300 million pounds of copper and more than doubling that the next two years, the Grasberg Block Cave would be 200 million pounds in 2020, and by 2022, it would be over 800 million pounds. So that's the \u2013 we got two ramp ups going here... Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Got it. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: ...with the Deep MLZ and the Grasberg Block Cave which is going to be the cornerstone of our future. Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Got it. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead. Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah, good morning and thanks for the call. My question is also around the Deep MLZ, the hydraulic fracking technique. Is this something that Freeport is currently familiar with? I know a couple of other mines, block caves that are doing the hydraulic fracking, but I wasn't sure if it's something that you're already doing at Grasberg? And then the second part of the question, if I may, how confident are you that this is going to resolve the seismic issues and I guess how concerned are you overall about the Deep MLZ and the risk that there is a significant problem there rather than a minor problem? Thanks. Mark J. Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: This is Mark Johnson. As far as the hydro fracking, it's not something that we've ever applied to an ore body before. We've had the equipment for, since the end of 2017. In the first half of the year, we've been doing testing that was required to calibrate the density of drilling that we would need. So we've had a period of time where we've gotten familiar with the equipment, the geologic setting. Our drill crews have been trained and we've had vendors and we've met with various consultants. We also collaborated with others in the industry that have been using it for some time. So we feel very confident that we have the crews, the equipment, and understanding of the geologic setting, and the density in which we need to drill it. So it's new to us. It's not new to the industry. Codelco has used it. Newcrest has used it, and it's been very effective in their setting. The consultants that have worked with Newcrest and Codelco are the same consultants that are working with us. So we have a high level of confidence in their judgment and their guidance, the modeling that they're doing on how it's going to affect and allow us to advance the cave and the Deep MLZ. To us, it's not a matter of if the Deep MLZ is going to cave, it's how do we cave it safely, how do we cave it in a controlled manner, and that's essentially what we're doing. We still have some unknowns. As we drill these holes, we'll be starting, as Richard mentioned, we've already started drilling wells. We'll begin fracking within the next couple weeks and it's not really a very complicated technology. It's fairly simple equipment. It's high pressure pumps. It's packing. It's been used in the \u2013 it's a much different type of application in the oil industry, but from a pumping standpoint, it's not that different. So we feel very confident that we're taking the right next step. And as Kathleen mentioned, we've given ourselves some time. We've built in some contingency in our schedule for some of the unknowns. And I'd say that three months from now, we'll be able to give you much more accurate estimate as to how that cave is going to start up. Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So our company's had experience with fracking and oil and gas business and so we spent a lot of time talking about the differences. This is fracking over a much narrower area and so forth and is so much simpler. But a lot of that fracking technology is \u2013 has been developed extensively in the oil business. So I think Mark's point was it's not a question of if, it's a question of when, safely. Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, Mark and Richard, very helpful. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Two questions. First of all, I was wondering your revised mine plan here for Grasberg, I mean how aggressive do you think this ramp-up schedule is now when I look at the ore milled in terms of throughput? And I'm just curious if you see potential more downside risk to that in terms of the level of the ramp up, where your comfort level is? And then the second question just had to do with Richard's comments in the press release about the company willing to adjust \"your plans\" if necessary to respond to market conditions. I was hoping you could maybe elaborate about what you mean by that and whether that implies potential production cuts or what in terms of \u2013 if copper prices weaken? Thank you. Mark J. Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: This is Mark again. As far as the ramp up of the GBC, we feel very confident of the geologic setting, what we call the hydraulic radius, that's required for us to cave. The Grasberg Block Cave is very similar to what it was in the DOZ. It's around a number of 30. We feel that we took a central estimate on our ramping up of the GBC. We've got much better access to the ore body. We have a lot more flexibility than we had in the DOZ. We feel very confident in the ramp up and that there's, like I said, a central estimate. There's, obviously, some downside and we also see some balancing upside. So that is a much different, it's much similar to what we've seen in the previous caves, in the Deep MLZ, IOZ area. The one thing that we have to manage there, and we've got a very good start on, is the managing of the water going from the pit to the underground. And we've got extensive efforts there to ensure that we don't build up any inventory of water before we start the block cave. Having access in the pit, we've got extensive monitoring much more than we've ever had in the past. And I just believe our caving knowledge as a result of some of the issues that we've had in the Deep MLZ that we've learned a lot globally on how to cave. It's also lent itself to more confidence and more robust GBC plan. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Sorry. Does that imply that you expect to reach full kind of nameplate throughput in 2023 based on the 2022 level? Mark J. Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah. We'll be ramping up, obviously, from zero, starting at the beginning of 2019. We have essentially two DOZ-sized mines that we're establishing in the Grasberg. And we're going to be ramping those up to 130,000 tons, 140,000 tons level in that timeframe up to 2022, 2023. Grasberg by itself will be in the 130,000-plus range. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, in terms of... Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So, Orest, that comment was kind of stating the obvious. I mean, here we've \u2013 mid-June for the past month, we've seen the price of copper go from $3.20, $3.25 to $2.75 and we got all these uncertainties overhanging the world's economy because of the trade talk and the trade actions. And we're showing operating cost numbers that are based on this current situation and we really haven't taken the steps that we would take if the global economy gets disrupted or China turns down. We've got a great track record. All you have to do is look back at what we did in 2008, 2009 and then what we did again in 2014. We have the flexibility to adjust to a lower price environment if we have to. A lot of our input costs are correlated to the price of copper. So we just want to make sure the obvious was there. We're not locked into this cost structure. If prices deteriorate, we have and would again adjust our operations to make sure that all of our mines are cash flow positive. We would defer expenditures. We would adjust operating cost as well as deferring capital expenditures and we'd hunker down again, for a period of time, and our company would continue to be cash flow positive. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Great. Appreciate the color. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And that's strictly a contingency plan. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera with CIBC. Please go ahead. Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Hello, Oscar. Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Sure. Just getting verification (00:47:59) on Mark's last statement in terms of reaching the Grasberg Block Caving capacity of 140,000 tons, was that 2022 or 2023? Mark J. Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: 2023, and our current plans were at 130,000 tons. Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. Mark J. Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And we have a potential of going up to 160,000 tons. Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. So the nominal capacity of the mill is 240,000 tons per day, so is that still the case or are you running that a little bit higher or could you? Mark J. Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah. Well, as it's shown there in that one slide that Kathleen referred to... Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: 215,000 tons. Mark J. Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: ... we're 215,000 tons in 2022. Between now and then, we put about $300 million of capital into the mill. One of the things that we have to do is add additional horsepower into the mill to get up to that capacity. One of the benefits that we lose when we move away from the Grasberg pit is that we currently drop the rock down, these 600-meter high ore passes. That has an impact on breaking the rock. We essentially fill that capacity up by adding more horsepower in the mill, but we do have plans in place of what would be required to get the mill back up to a 240,000 tons based on the rock types that we'll be mining in the future, the grinding capacity that we would need to get the recoveries. And that's all part of our long-term mill expansion plan. Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much. And then, if you could \u2013 like, I mean, it seems like there's still a lot of really good grade on the Grasberg open pit. If I remember correctly, you said that once the block caving starts, then you cannot have access to that. So would it be possible to just mine some of that 2% copper equivalent grade at a later date or is this something that is just going to be left there for eternity? Mark J. Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: No, it's the \u2013 what we leave behind in the pit gets picked up very quickly in the block cave. I wish it was as easy, and what we're doing with this pit extension is about two-thirds our way down the pit along the ramp, we have the opportunity to re-mine the lower portion of that ramp. It's a relatively minor volume. It's about 5 million tons, but a very good grade, and it makes an impact, as Richard mentioned, this pit extension. We've had further modeling from our geotechnical experts that indicate that we can have six months of concurrent block cave development along with this re-mining of the ramp. We have some additional opportunity, if for whatever reason that the interaction didn't happen as quickly. We have some capability of continuing on for several months, but it's not a long-term pit extension. We would have to really go up to the top, mine through extensive waste stripping. That's a much bigger multi-year commitment. That's not what we're embarking on right here. It's relatively simple, relatively straightforward, the re-mining of a ramp. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: That just wouldn't be economic. I mean we've known that since the 1990s to continue to widen and deal with it. Mark, correct me, but, Oscar, it's not you leave that there forever. That ore is going to cave into the block cave, it's just going to be diluted with lower grade material. Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Lower grade, yeah. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So from the pit, we can get directly to the access. All that ore is going to come down, get mined, but it's going to be mixed with lower grade material and ultimately processed. Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: I think regardless, it's pretty impressive, guys. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Right. And Oscar, also we want to just keep in mind, even though we're talking about these transition years at Grasberg, we're still going to have very low cost. Grasberg will continue to be a low cost mine in the portfolio even during the transition years and then getting to 2021, 2022. By 2022, we're back into a net credit position from a unit cost standpoint. So even during the transition years given the high grades of copper and gold in the ore that we're mining, our net cost will still be our lowest cost and then we'll have significant improvements as we get to 2021 and 2022 with the volume increase. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And while I've made a comparison to completing one mine and starting another, Mark just said something, we're going to be able to develop these new mines by investing $300 million in the mill. And you all know how much new mills cost these days. So we're going to benefit from all this infrastructure that's been developed since going way back, but especially during the 1990s to be able to achieve these levels of volumes. Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much guys and good luck. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thanks, Oscar. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC : Hey, good morning, Richard. Thank you for taking my question. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Sure, Chris. Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC : If we look at your unit production costs in North America, South America and Indonesia, the production delivery costs in North America have been steadily and somewhat materially increasing. I think over the last year, unit costs were up around 30%, whereas in South America, they've been more flat, and Indonesia has been pretty good as well. So the first question is, why have you experienced this pretty significant steady cost inflation in the U.S.? And then the second question is, how should we expect that to trend over time? Where do these assets sit in the cost curve in five years' time? Obviously, if the Grasberg Indonesia deals get done, you'll be relatively less exposed to the Indonesian asset and more exposed to the North American and South American assets. I think they'll become more of a focus, just trying to understand the competitive positioning in those assets, longer-term. That would be my first question. Thanks. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: The \u2013 Red can add to this. But the big change we've had in North America has been more driven by ore grades changes during that period that you referenced and also an increase in our mining rates. During the downturn, we did take steps to park trucks and do what we could to reduce costs as much as possible and mine different shapes. Now we're mining more in a sustainable sequence. We're not showing in our numbers any step change in North American costs from where we are now. We have experienced here in recent months some inflation dealing with energy prices, freight cost, sulfuric acid cost. But in terms of the big change, that was more volume ore grade related and an increase in our mining costs to give us a sustainable level of future production and ensure capacity going forward. But if you project out our cash costs leaving commodity inputs flat today, we're not showing any significant changes in our North American cash costs from where we are now. Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC : That's very helpful. Thank you. Harry M. \u201cRed\u201d Conger IV - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah, one other thing I would add, North America is very sensitive to moly prices, so movements in moly prices change North America quite a bit as well. Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC : Right, yeah, I guess I was looking more at the production delivery cost before netting out to byproducts and I know that part of the reason for that cost inflation obviously lower grades also higher input costs, higher copper price as well, but I was a little bit concerned about second quarter cost being somewhat materially higher than first quarter even though the copper price fell a little bit from first quarter to second quarter, so it just sounds like it's a function of grades and maybe just some inherent industry wide inflation. Is that right? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: That's correct. And I'll just comment, it's still a very profitable, profitable business for us, high volumes with cost with good margins. The industry, I mentioned earlier, a lot of input costs are correlated to copper prices. Now, we've had this unusual situation over the last month where we were at $3.20 and now $2.75. So it's really kind of a distorted situation currently. But at the end of the day, whatever economics globally results from what's going on right now is going to affect all commodities. And so our cost will track what happens with copper prices. We think our price is going to go back up. We have to fight this increased cost of energy and transportation and things like sulfur. I mean we just had a meeting last week as we do the week before every earnings call where we had 65 of our mine managers in and all we were doing is harping on this issue of fighting this \u2013 fight to maintain our margins, fight to maintain \u2013 how can we be more efficient, how can we use \u2013 we're using all this data analysis now. We're putting sensors on all of our trucks and trying to get more and more efficient and we're making progress there. But that's an everyday fight in our business, every day. Christopher LaFemina - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Co. Please go ahead. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Co.: Hi, thanks guys. Quick question on \u2013 a couple of questions on Grasberg. In terms of the CapEx, is it around $1 billion per year until the end of 2022 when the underground is mostly developed and then should it \u2013 should the sustaining capital at that point drop down below that $1 billion level? Just trying to get a sense for CapEx going forward. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yes, we're spending on the order of $800 million a year over the five-year period and that's $700 million net to PT-FI. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Co.: Okay. All right. Great. And then I assume, right, it should drop down to a sustaining level which should be materially below that once it's all fully developed? Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah, we'll have another mine called the Kucing Liar mine that is currently contemplated to be developed. We'll have to look at the economics on that one as we get closer to it. But as Richard said earlier, the infrastructure, all the money that we've invested today is largely in place. We've got some mill enhancements to make, but going forward, it's more the development that you do over time in the block caves. So, in terms of the infrastructure cost, those are largely behind us. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Co.: Okay. Okay, great. And then also, Kathleen, you're talking about the mine continuing to be a low unit cost mine during this kind of ramp up period in 2019 and 2020. Is that \u2013 so I mean, can we assume then that the total operating cost at Grasberg will decline as you're mining less ore, mining and processing less ore there, so meaning that it seems like the production costs at Grasberg are somewhere around $1.8 billion a year now and should we assume that in 2019 and 2020, those production costs will decline as I guess as the open pit labor \u2013 I mean labor in the open pit declines and you're spending more on capital than on operating costs? Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah., and the mill rate will also go down in 2019 and 2020 from where we are today. So we will have lower absolute costs than we have currently. And then what I was referring to is really looking at our net unit cash costs after the gold credits, will still be our lowest cost operation in the portfolio, and then get to this net credit position that we're enjoying in 2018. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Co.: Right. Okay. I mean, and could you give us a sense as to what you expect the cost to be once you're fully ramped at Grasberg in the, say, in the 2023 to 2027 time period? Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah, well, we've given a number before being less than $0.60 a pound. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Co.: Okay. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: In these earlier years, it'll likely be less than that. Like I was saying in 2022 currently, we're projecting it to be a net credit. So that was the less than $0.60 a pound was more of a life of mine, but in this period, you're talking about it's likely to be lower than that. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Co.: Okay. All right, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning, everyone. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Good morning. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I hope you don't mind if I change the subject real quick. But wanted to know if you could provide us any color on the Cerro Verde labor negotiations, you note in the release that's coming up for a decision by the end of August. Harry M. \u201cRed\u201d Conger IV - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah, Timna, we're working closely with the union leadership there. Discussions are ongoing all under early negotiation parameters. So we're cautiously optimistic that all of that is going to come together. But right now, discussions are ongoing and going well. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: But it hasn't been settled. Harry M. \u201cRed\u201d Conger IV - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: It has not been. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: It has not been settled and there's a lot of labor contracts in South America, and so far, we haven't had the sort of disruptions that potentially were there, but we've got some big contracts including ours that are still up in the air. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got you. Is it fair to say that if Escondida is delayed or hits a snag that that could have a knock-on effect on the Cerro Verde negotiations or do you think those are separate? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, I've always said strikes are contagious diseases. So it's clearly union people communicate, watch what's going on. So it's \u2013 we don't have an answer to that question, but clearly, there is a relationship. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. And then my other question is just if you wouldn't mind helping us understand maybe the parameters around the next move in the dividend. I know you mentioned that that's something that could be revisited certainly with strong cash flows, but \u2013 any sense of how the board is thinking about priorities or what the parameters might be for further increase? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, we have expectations and we're looking forward to further increases, but we're going to have to get past this current uncertainty with the global economy from all these trade talks, see how that goes. So right now that's deferred depending on that situation. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And the copper price being at a higher level is what you mean by that? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: That's correct. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Got it. Okay. I'll let it go there. Thanks very much. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah. You got right through the bottom of it, so. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Richard, just quick on Lone Star, where do you stand relative to equipment orders? How much is first copper produced in 2020 first half, second half and have you hired EPCM to look at the sulfide and the potential there or any help on like pre-feasibility on that type of investment. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So that's divided between the two. The oxide project is now underway. We're actually, I mean, it actually looks like a mine now. Beginning earlier this year, we began transporting material. So that's underway. There's not really (01:05:25) any real significant equipment to go. We still have... Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Mainly trucks and shovels. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And we've got that. Mark J. Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Which we own. We didn't have to go buy a new one. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Right. And so we expect first copper there by 2020. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: By year end 2020. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: By year end 2020. And so then you turn to the sulfide and right now, it's understanding what it is. I mean, we're \u2013 like I said, we got six exploration core oil rigs working out there now. We're analyzing these recent results of our drilling we've done to-date. We're defining \u2013 the ore body keeps being extended, east and west and in depth. And so, right now, we're in that stage of understanding what it is and our development team is beginning to think about what this would be, how large would the initial development be, and how you stage that in terms of making sure you have access to the total resource. So it's in the early stage of definition. Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And Kathleen, how much of the growth capital that's budgeted for 2019 is allocated here at Lone Star, approximate. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: I don't have the number right in front of me, but it's probably on the order of $300 plus million. Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Excellent. Thank you very much. Good luck, everyone. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: All right. Appreciate it. Operator : We'll now turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: All right. Thanks everybody for participating and for your interest and we look forward to speaking with you as we go forward. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we want to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We want to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2017 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. Richard Adkerson is on the call today, as well as Red Conger, Mark Johnson, and Mike Kendrick. I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results, and then turn the call over to Richard, who'll be referring to our prepared slides for today's call. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for questions. Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $556 million, or $0.38 per share, for the third quarter of 2018. The results included net gains of $42 million, or $0.03 per share, which primarily reflected adjustments to assets held for sale and the fair value of potential contingent consideration, partly offset by non-recurring charges associated with a new three-year collective labor agreement at Cerro Verde. After adjusting for these net gains, our adjusted net income totaled $514 million, or $0.35 per share. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the third quarter totaled $1.8 billion, and there's a reconciliation of the EBITDA calculation on page 27 of our slide deck. We reported strong sales during the quarter. Our copper sales exceeded 1 billion pounds of copper, gold sales totaled 837,000 ounces, and molybdenum sales were 22 million pounds in the third quarter. These sales \u2013 the copper sales were 8% higher than our previous guidance and gold sales were 20% higher, and this principally reflects higher ore grades and operating rates in Indonesia as we mine the final phases of the Grasberg open pit. In addition, we are confirming in all material respects our operational outlook guidance in the coming years. Our third quarter average copper price realized was $2.80 per pound. That was below last year's third quarter average of $2.94 per pound. And our gold average realization was $1,191 per quarter, and that was also below last year's third quarter of $1,290 per ounce. For the third quarter, our average unit net cash costs for our mines averaged $0.93 per pound. That reflects a strong performance from our global operations and the continued focus on productivity and cost management. The $0.93 also includes $0.07 per pound of copper associated with nonrecurring charges for the Cerro Verde three-year labor agreement that I mentioned previously. We generated strong operating cash flows in the third quarter, which totaled $1.25 billion, and those exceeded capital expenditures of $500 million during the quarter. We ended the quarter with consolidated cash of $4.6 billion and consolidated debt of $11.1 billion. Our net debt at the end of September was $6.6 billion, and that continues with our deleveraging that we've had over the last several quarters. We ended the period with a strong liquidity position. In addition to our cash position, we also have a $3.5 billion revolving credit facility and have no borrowings under that facility. Our board also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share under the new policy that was established earlier this year, and that dividend will be paid \u2013 that quarterly dividend will be paid on November 1. I'll now turn the call over to Richard, who will be providing additional details and referring to our slide presentation materials. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. As we'll be talking about, as I do review these highlights, it's been a very active quarter for us here at FCX. Results from our global mining operations have been solid, our teams continue to execute our plans in a very effective way. In Indonesia, we had an important milestone in progressing our efforts to reach stabilization of our business there in terms of our negotiations with the government with the signing of definitive divestment agreements on September 27. Operations, current operations in Papua have been strong, and we've made important progress in transitioning the Grasberg ore body mining from open pit to underground, so we'll talk about that. We are continuing our sharp focus on the important things about our business to build shareholder value. Our unit net costs are at $0.93 a pound, significantly below last year and in line with our plans, it does reflect for the nine months $0.02 as a result of the successful settlement of our labor situation in Cerro Verde and Peru, so that was very good. Operating cash flows exceeded CapEx in the third quarter by $740 million [ph], $2.5 billion to-date. Net debt, as Kathleen mentioned, is down $2 billion from the start of the year. And this agreement with Inalum is really important. It establishes the path to reaching long-term stability and de-risk our operations over the long-term in Indonesia. We're going to talk about Lone Star. I mean, we're very excited about it in terms of the future of our company, and this is a ore body that's been identified for decades, but we're doing a lot of core drilling and the more we drill, the more optimistic we get about this ore body becoming a world-class mining operation in the future. It's growing now, has the potential to grow in the future. Slide 4 [ph], copper market, it's a paradox. To be frank with you, it's a paradox right now. Physical markets are tight. Fundamental drivers remain very positive and yet sentiment about the commodity and about companies like ours in the investor marketplace is what it is and you know their concerns about global growth in China and so forth. But when you look at the fundamentals and look at this drop in global copper exchange stocks, and to see the copper price in that slide parallel to each other is very unusual in our industry typically when inventory stocks drop and they're also dropping at our customers, that indicates higher copper prices, but that's not what we experienced since June. But when you look at the fundamentals, U.S. constructions and manufacturing remained positive, Europe is steady and positive, large Chinese fabricators are running at higher rates. Our customers have strong order books for us in the United States and business in China is good. Cathode availability is tight globally. There's issues with smelters disruptions in Chile and elsewhere in India. China is constraining scrap. Global stocks are down 40%, since the copper price was well over $3, almost $3.30 in early June, and this is a multi-year low stocks. But speculators are bearish on sentiment and macro drivers, and this is having a significant impact on price. The long-term fundamentals are becoming increasingly strong. Deficits are inevitable absent a significant downturn in China and the global economy, and a lot of positives are happening in terms of alternative energy generations, electric vehicles, and so forth for our project. Now, what's this doing to us? This uncertainty is causing us certainly to slow down our long-term plans to develop our resources. I mean, we're going to defer those investment decisions until there is clarity in the marketplace. We're continuing to work on them, do preparation for them. We're optimistic about them, but this situation is causing us to defer and I believe it will cause other companies to defer, and that will add to this impending supply gap situation for the industry. So, as I said, it's a paradox. I was in London for LME Week and most industry executives I talked to there and on the business roundtable believe that this trade situation will get resolved in a way that doesn't disrupt the global economy. But investors are skeptical and that's what we have to deal with in terms of the current situation. A slide that we commonly show or have shown for many years is on page 5, and it makes an important information here. It's very difficult to replicate a world-class resource. The industry is supply constrained; discoveries are rare. There is 7- to 10-year lead times to develop new projects. And when you go down this list of the day's major copper mines in terms of reserves and production, you see Escondida and Grasberg in the 1980s, Las Bambas in 2000s, and then other mines are 100 years old or more. And with all the activity that's gone on since the super cycle started in 2003, there haven't been new additions to these charts. We think Lone Star is going to be on this chart at some point, but it's important for our industry to note this issue of supply challenges. And that points to the strength of our company with our strong current production levels and our future resources. So operations update on page 6. As I talk about, we're focused on productivity and cost management. We've had some success with that. There's some cost inflation, but we've largely been able to offset that through efficiency moves and you can see that in our numbers. Our production and cost outlook is stabilizing as we see going forward. In 2016, 2017, because of the low copper prices and some degree because of the situation of our company, we cut back costs. We constrained maintenance capital. We were focused on costs principally. Now we're looking to \u2013 and you see this in our numbers in 2018 in Americas, we're looking to maintain our production volumes going forward. We cut mining rates and now we're increasing mining rates, and that involves some costs inherently. But now as we look far with our plans, we think our costs are stabilized. And we do think we're going to be able to manage cost inflation in an effective way, so that's an important part of what we're doing in operation. We'll talk more about Lone Star, but beyond that we're evaluating our project pipeline to consider alternatives, rank them, make decisions about what we might do in the future. We're going to remain disciplined and we have the chance, the opportunities to do low risk capital expansions when the market is right for doing that. So, in Indonesia, you can see we had really strong performance in the third quarter and year-to-date in 2018. After an extended period of time of issues associated with our workforce, some of our operating systems, and with security issues, we are now operating in a very effective way safe operation, strong production, making progress on the things that we need to address. We're mining the final phase of the Grasberg open pit in the fourth quarter of this year. I was there when we were drilling the core holes in 1988 and it's amazing to think about here we are finishing the pit. We're going to extend operations in the pit into 2019 by mining. Our guys came out with a great idea. We had some haul truck ramps that have some high grade ore in it, and so we were originally just going to abandon those and mine that ore from the underground. Now we're going to go back in in the first half of the year and access some of those high grade sections of the haul roads and mine that. By mid-2019 we'll be complete in the pit, and it'll be significantly winding down now and going forward. At the Deep MLZ mine, which is an important mine for our future, it's separate from the Grasberg Block Cave mine, which really has the bulk of our reserves over the remaining terms of our operating rights to 2041. This Deep MLZ is a great mine. It's a separate mineralization area that started with the Ertsberg pit years ago and we began block caving that mineralization area in the early 1980s actually. And as we commenced this in 2016/2017, we started experiencing, for the first time in our operation, these mining-induced seismic events. To address that, we are using a procedure of using hydraulic fracturing of the rock to manage seismicity and pre-condition the cave. This is done in South America and Chile. It's not complicated technology. It's established and we've begun that process, and today it's been effective in doing what we wanted to do. So it's giving us increased confidence, de-risk our plans for the mid-2019 startup of caving in the Deep MLZ. With the Grasberg Block Cave, after years of investment plans, our infrastructure is now in place. We're successfully testing a new underground rail system and ore flow system. We're conducting initial blast for undercutting during the third quarter. Rock testing confirms that this rock is suitable. It's the same ore that we've been mining since 1990 in the Grasberg open pit, and it's suitable for a really effective block cave mining. And our company is the world's leader in underground mining because of all the experience we have. In terms of scale, this is going to be the largest underground operation ever done. But in terms of the technical challenges is things we've worked with for years and we're very comfortable in doing it. So Lone Star, those of you who follow us know that this Lone Star resource is located in Eastern Arizona adjacent to our Safford mine, which began operations \u2013 was beginning operations 11 years ago when we acquired Phelps Dodge, and now the Safford oxide ore is declining production. And so we have excess processing facilities that we are going to use in mining oxide ore from Lone Star. We're stripping this. You can see the pictures of the progress we've made by stripping it. Year end 2017 reserves were 4.4 billion pounds of copper; only oxides. It's $850 million project. We're well into it and it's got 200 million pounds annually of production for 20 years. Now, as we drill this ore body, the oxide resources are expanding, and this has given us some opportunities. And then we had previously drilled an underlying, what appears to be, very large sulfide resource. And our current drilling is confirming this and extending the sulfide resource. So what we're doing now with the oxide project is in essence stripping this material to expose what could be a world-class sulfide resource. Morenci is just over the mountains, very nearby. This has the potential of being a Morenci-type ore body in the future. And it's going to be a key part of FCX's future going forward. So returning back to PT-FI and Indonesia, here's where we stand. As Kathleen said, there are no significant changes today to our previous outlook. Activities during this quarter have, in our view, de-risked to a significant degree our ability to achieve this. But we will have \u2013 as we complete any mining activities from the pit in mid-2019, we'll have two transition years in terms of achieving production rates for the Deep MLZ and ramping up the Grasberg Block Cave. And when I say ramping up, you see the rust red part of the slide showing the Block Cave ramping up. The purple slots above that showing the Deep MLZ mine ramping up, and that's supplemented by the existing DOZ mine, which is above the Deep MLZ mine, which is in its decline phase. So, we will have a very significant copper and gold this year. We'll have a couple of years. And you can see all the numbers here shown for you below this chart. And then, we'll be reaching the levels that we will have for our long-term mine operations when all this is fully developed and operating as planned. And that extends through 2041 and this will be one of the world's largest copper mines, big gold mine, very attractive economics because of mixture of both, long-term, low cost operations. So, the agreement with Inalum, the agreement with Inalum that we signed on September 27, in my view, is very important and it's very positive outcome for all parties. And when I say all parties that includes the government, its state-owned company Inalum, achieving objectives that they had clearly communicated to us over the years. Our joint venture partner Rio Tinto is achieving \u2013 will be achieving its objective of exiting this asset. They were facing divestment in any event. They have negotiated a valuation that's acceptable both to them and to the government. And then to our shareholders, I will tell you this, I'm much more pleased about where we are today than what I expected to be last year when we signed the framework agreement. And the reason for that was \u2013 the key to this being so positive for all the partners actually was Rio Tinto's decision to sell. The government is acquiring Rio Tinto's interest, which will ultimately be a 40% interest. We're only having to divest an effective just over 5% interest in the property. A year ago, we thought we might have to invest 27%. So that avoided a very difficult valuation negotiation and so forth. At the end of the day, PT-FI, the Indonesian subsidiary, will get bigger. Previously, it was a joint venture partner with Rio Tinto, and now Rio Tinto's interest will come into PT-FI. PT-FI will then have the total operations. The shareholder own \u2013 and it will continue as an entity. The shareholder ownership interest will be 51% Inalum, 49% FCX. We have agreed on a shareholder arrangement that protects the economics that FCX had under the Rio Tinto joint venture agreement. So we will be getting substantially all of the production through 2022. We've agreed on a corporate governance operating structure, where we will be partners with Inalum in terms of the corporate structure, but there will be a shareholders' agreement that will grant FCX control over an operating committee to ensure that operations are run in a consistent way with what we've done now and consistent with the long-term mine plan that we've agreed to. We will have extension of rights through 2041, with assured fiscal and legal terms and legal enforceability. And there are no significant changes in those terms from our contract work. So, all of this comes together that gives us a very positive deal. Now, one thing that I believe is very important is by having Inalum as a 51% partner and they seem to be on the verge of commencing the activities of raising the bond financing to finance this acquisition from Rio Tinto is that we'll now have an alignment of interest between the government and the Indonesian Freeport. They will want to see the operations run with stability, because they'll need cash flows to fund this significant debt they're taking on. And the markets being very positive \u2013 appears to be very positive in terms of being receptive to this bond offering, and so they'll want to see the operation run smoothly, to generate cash flows, to service their debt, and generate dividends. So, I believe firmly that this will create a better overall environment for operations than what we've experienced in recent years because of the divergence of opinions and views about what we should be doing now. I think we're all going to be together aligned, and that will be helpful. So we have a very diversified global set of assets. We're in a leadership position. The core feature of our company is we operate all the assets that we own interest in. That gives us significant operational synergy, shared resources. We can allocate capital in a way that's prudent and effective. Large long-term production capacity with long-term expansion. Three-quarters of our reserves and resources are located in North America and South America. In today's world, that's a positive. We've got a great team, experienced in operations, project development, execution, innovation, leadership in the industry. And in the United States, we benefit from the improved regulatory environment, but also across the tax situation. One consequence of the oil and gas deal was a very large tax loss carryforward, which means we're not going to pay taxes in the United States for many years. And the recent Tax Reform Act actually drops the effective tax rate for our company absent the NOL to around 10%. That's a big difference from what you face internationally. So, that's going to be very positive for us in terms of looking at Indonesia. Now, market valuations \u2013 market valuation \u2013 I've been around long enough to know that's just what it is. But the one thing the way we've looked at this recently to think about, talks about the valuation of our asset is recognizing going back to that chart of the major mines where we have three of today's major mines that the portfolio that FCX have is very difficult to replicate. Our copper equivalent capacity to our equity share is about 4.5 billion pounds of copper a year. When we look through projects around the world that we're looking at and others are looking at, we see it's $8 to $10 a pound to develop capacity. And that means on that simple high-level metric that the implied replacement cost for our current capacity is on the order of plus or minus $40 billion. Just a thought for you guys to look at, but that's where we are. Okay, so 2018 outlook is unchanged from previous guidance : copper at 3.8 billion pounds; gold's a bit higher at 2.45 million (sic) ounces; molybdenum, 95 million pounds; site production costs reflecting this $0.02 special item at Cerro Verde for the labor settlements in line with where we're before; after by-product credits just over $1; operating cash flows at $2.85 for copper for the fourth quarter, it would be (sic) $4.2 billion. We are going to have some... Unverified Participant : Dollars. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: ...dollars. $4.2 billion. We are going to have some tax \u2013 essentially tax-related working capital usage totaling about $500 million in the fourth quarter. And we of course very highly leverage copper prices for the fourth quarter of $0.10 means just over $100 million to us. No real changes in our capital expenditures from previous guidance. And so we're basically confirming the guidance we've given you previously. Sales profiles are presented on the slide 12. We've essentially brought forward some copper from the fourth quarter into the third quarter this year. We always try to do that. We'll try to do it in the fourth quarter. But for the year, our \u2013 we were up in the third quarter keeping our year guidance consistent with where we are. And you can see how the outlook goes for copper, gold and molybdenum. When we look at the cash flow generating capacity of our company on slide 13, we are showing this to show the transition years, 2019 and 2020, and then the average for the years after transition (sic) 2021 and 2022... Unverified Participant : 2021, 2022. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: 2021, 2022. And EBITDA would be $4.3 billion at $3 copper, $7.1 billion for 2021, 2022 at (31:52) $3 copper, operating cash flows just over $3 billion to $4.7 billion, and the $3.50, that grows significantly to EBITDA of $5.9 billion for the transition years, over $9 billion for the subsequent years with cash flows $4.3 billion to $6.4 billion. So, our company is characterized by the ability to generate very strong cash flows from our existing productive facilities. Capital expenditures, really no changes from what we've talked about. We had a plan, we're sticking with it. Financial policy, Kathleen talked about net debt being at $6.6 billion at the end of September. In early 2016, we had set a plan to reduce our $20 billion of debt at that time by $5 billion to $10 billion over two years. We've already done $13.6 billion. And so we've really come a long way in addressing Freeport's balance sheet issue and we have a strong financial situation now after the strong deleveraging over the past two years. And so, we are \u2013 as I said, looking forward continue to strengthen our balance sheet. We reinstated the dividend. We're looking forward to the time of paying higher dividends. We've got growth opportunities. We're going to be very disciplined about when we undertake those. We're going to need to see clarity in the marketplace, some of these uncertainties resolved, and we'll continue to review this financial policy as we go forward. But I'm really pleased with the way our company is really set up for future success. With our global portfolio of copper assets, copper is very attractive. When you look at its long-term fundamental market outlook, that's something you hear from a lot of others in the industry. With our company, we have strong margins and cash flows, long-lived reserves, good development opportunities, geographically diversed with 75% of our future P&D (34:23) come from the Americas. And we've got a great organization that's experienced and had success. Now, we've addressed our balance sheet, I believe the Indonesian overhang issue has been addressed, I will say we're no longer debating issues in Indonesia. We do have to complete some documentations of our agreements prior to closing. We expect closing to occur, if not at the end of 2018, in very early 2019. And today, I would suggest that our attraction \u2013 our value attraction is \u2013 valuation is attractive in light of all these other factors. And we are looking forward to outperforming and committed to that. So, I will open the line for questions. I look forward to responding to any questions you may have. Operator : Our first question will come from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, Richard and Kathleen, thanks for taking my questions. First one I had is just on the capital allocation decision going forward. I think you'd mentioned previously that you wanted to get net debt below $5 billion as your target. So, can you just talk through where you want the balance sheet to be at? And then leading on from that, if you believe in copper, you've talked about the fundamentals and how you see it playing going forward, will you invest in new projects and potentially look at M&A et cetera if the sentiment remains bearish, i.e., will you continue down the path that you see is the right way to add value even if investment sentiment isn't in the market for the next year or so? Thanks. That's the first question. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Chris, I'll take the first part of that, and let Richard address the second part. Our net debt target has been reached. We had set out to get that net debt to $10 billion. And we reached that last year. And so, now we're just continuing to strengthen the balance sheet. We've initiated the dividend to shareholders, we'll continue to look at capital allocation and return to shareholders, but we feel good about the net debt that we currently have, and that is below our target. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So, Chris, with respect to your second question, we're going to prepare ourselves for future investments. We've got a number of alternatives and we're going through a ranking process to decide sort of which one to focus in on first, and we'll do that. I would say, in thinking about what you said; to me, this is not a question of investor sentiment, but it's really a question is, where is this world heading. On one hand, if \u2013 and this is the consensus view of business people I talk to that all of this issues between the U.S. and China today is a posture in creating a lever to try to address some fundamental industrial policy issues in China, and many people believe that there will be a resolution of that similar to what we just went through with NAFTA and so forth that it's a question of style and strategy to reach a settlement. And that's one thing, because if that's reached, then \u2013 the underlying economies are still really strong in China and globally, and particularly in the United States. On the other hand, if this goes in a different direction and results in a significant impact in China, there are those who say that China has the ability to address a weakening of its export manufacturing economy by investing in infrastructure, in this Belt and Road Initiative and so forth. But all of that, it's a question of what really is result of all of this. If that has an impact on copper demand in China so important, then we're going to wait to see how that sorts out. So, we're not going to be bullheaded about this, we're not going to be overly confident about our ability to predict it. We're going to prepare. We're not going to start investments until we have clarity about the ultimate outcome of all these current uncertainties that are weighing so heavily on investors' minds today. We're going to focus on internal opportunities and increasing shareholder returns. If we get a favorable outcome of all of this and copper price recovers, we'll be making a lot of money. We have the chance to invest internally and increase our dividends. We're going to be out there observing everything that goes on in the marketplace. I can assure you we get contacted by companies and bankers about opportunities all the time. And we're going to be open to those. But it's a high hurdle for an outside opportunity to compete with our internal opportunities because we have no value for those right now. We also have no taxes to pay on future operations in Indonesia and wherever else, I mean, in the U.S. Indonesia, we'll pay strong taxes. But here in the U.S. \u2013 and that's a huge advantage when you're looking at comparing after-tax rates of returns because resources are taxed heavily wherever they are in the world. You have investment certainty in the U.S. that is stronger than anywhere else. So, anyway, that's where we are, Chris. And it's not \u2013 I see it more as a fundamental question as opposed to an investor sentiment question. Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Thanks for the color there. And my second question is just around Grasberg specifically. I assume you'll give guidance or you'll zoom in on the full year results in February. But can you talk just a little bit more about 1Q and 2Q? I guess you've given guidance that the open pit will be complete by the end of \u2013 or the middle of 2019. Which is, I guess, the highest risk period in 1Q or 2Q, how do you see those two quarters playing out specifically? Thanks. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, the open pit will continue through the first half, and we're not expecting at this point for Deep MLZ to start caving. So most of the production that we're expecting in the first half is coming from established production either the open pit or DOZ in the first half. We have in our estimates for Deep MLZ incorporated some contingency plans and at this point in time, we still believe that the mid-2019 startup is appropriate. We do have the chance to potentially accelerate that. And as we always do, we always look for ways to accelerate metal. But we will begin \u2013 as Richard said, we've got the Grasberg Block Cave infrastructure prepared, and we will begin activities in the Grasberg Block Cave in the first half in parallel with completing the open pit. So, the Deep MLZ, as Richard said, is a very small portion of our 2019 production, it's less than 10% of our ore through the mill. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And, Chris, just refer back page 8, and you can see that Deep MLZ and the Grasberg Block Cave are both small parts of the annual production in 2019 growing in 2020, and the pit is completed in first half of 2019, DOZ is there. So you can see from that really where we're doing and that starts emerging in the second half of the year when we're out of the pit altogether. Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. I'll leave it there. Thank you. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew Korn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, everyone. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Good morning. Matthew Korn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Congratulations on a good solid operational quarter there. Question on Indonesia, in the context of the agreement, if you could help us understand a little bit more where we are regarding the environmental issues. I think it's an element I find investors are still somewhat unclear. So, first, have there been any changes so far as to what's actually been requested of Freeport? Second, what part of the government are you interacting with and what's your read on what they want? And then again at the end, at the end of the day, do you expect that this is going to result in any kind of real material change to the operations there? Thanks. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Matthew. Good to hear from you. So, the government is working in a coordinated fashion across the ministries. Energy and Mines Ministry, which administers our basic operations; the Finance Ministry; the state-owned enterprise industry which manages our new partner, Inalum, and the Ministry of Environmental and Forestry, which deals with the environmental issues. We have been given assurances that environmental issues will be resolved in a way that will not disrupt our operations or add significant additional cost to our operations. And, in fact, there is today and recently articles in the Indonesian press to that effect. We are working with the Environmental Ministry to document how to deal with these new decrees that came out and announced in our first quarter earnings call. And so, the objective is to come up with ways to amend those decrees to achieve that objective of not disrupting our operations or adding additional costs. All of us are working together that \u2013 as you can imagine, this is a significant matter for Inalum and its financing activities. And we've been working with their banks and lawyers in terms of understanding that and working with the Environmental Ministry to achieve that goal. So, everybody is working with the same goal. We have to get documentation for it. It's necessary to have that done before we close the deal. We also have some wording in the new license agreement to complete. We're working on some agreements to give us international arbitration rights to enforce our rights going forward. All of those things, as I said earlier \u2013 issues are not being debated. Work is coming together to get documentation of what we've agreed to. Matthew Korn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. I appreciate all that color. Very helpful. Second one is simpler, yeah, we saw the one-time charge for Cerro Verde that had been the big pending labor agreement for you all. Cost-wise, what should we think \u2013 how should the effect be in terms of P&D costs going forward for that region as a result? Thanks. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Matthew, this is Kathleen. We're not expecting any significant changes in our net cash costs in South America or North America as we look forward. As Richard talked about earlier, we have been taking steps during 2018 to reinitiate mining rates and reestablish the production capacity following the curtailments in 2015 and 2016. But from here, we're not expecting the unit cost to change significantly as we look forward... Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah, great... Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: ...for 2018. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And I'll compliment Red here that milling facility I believe is the largest in the world in the mining industry and with our recent expansion and the sizeable mill that we had there before that, man, it's going great. I mean, it is above nameplate. And so all of that \u2013 it's a big low-grade deposit, mining is relatively easy, just a lot of work, lot of material to move, but that's a great operation with years of \u2013 of a lot of cash flows ahead of it. And we were very pleased with the labor settlement. We had this one-time charge, but it allowed us to meet the aspirations of the workforce and do it in a way that controlled our costs. Matthew Korn - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. I appreciate it. Best of luck to you, folks. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Okay. Good luck to you too, Matthew. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead. Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everybody. Richard, Kathleen, I wanted to follow up a little bit on the shareholder agreement that has been put in place to maintain the split of economics through 2022 and then beyond. In the hypothetical case where maybe things take a little bit longer to ramp in Indonesia, would you still preserve the same split? So, in other words, if maybe production goes from 2022 to 2023, would that have any impact on your economics? Thank you. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: The answer is, yes. We preserve the economics. Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: That's... (49:33) Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: We'll be in the same position we would have been in with Rio Tinto. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: There is a specified amount of metal that... Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: It's not a timing deal, it's a specified amount of metal. Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Great. Excellent. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And one thing I should have mentioned when I was talking about this overall deal, when we were on the NPV of this operation under our COW and our joint venture arrangements with Rio Tinto, it's rough \u2013 it's very much equivalent to what we'll have under this new structure. And if you think about how far we've come to end up with an answer of where we've achieved our goal for extension stability and preserved the FCX's economic interest in this great asset, that's a great accomplishment. And we're not popping the champagne bottles until closing, but we're very optimistic about getting this done in the timeframe that I talked about. Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Excellent. No, great job on it. And, yeah, I look forward to the agreement coming over the finish line here in short order. I wanted to follow-up on the operations in Indonesia. So, Richard, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you've de-risked it. Now when I look at your guidance, it hasn't changed materially. So should we be thinking about you having narrowed the confidence interval around the mean? So if you could elaborate on that, that would be helpful. And specifically to the DMLZ and Grasberg Block Cave, what are some of the milestones that we should be looking forward to over the next six months or so? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So this is what we've done. With respect to our current operations \u2013 and it's the open pit mine, the DOZ essentially, but also running the mill with the ore flow delivery systems, with the concentrate delivery systems, using the slurry pipelines to get to the port, our relationship with our workforce and local community and security, all of those things are much, much improved and they are important. Then in terms of the Grasberg Block Cave development, which over the years with all the disruptions that we had from export bans and security issues and so forth, that's just gone really good. I mean, Mark Johnson and his team have done an exceptional job, and now, Mark, pipe up. But I say, we have completed and met all the risk of infrastructure development for the Block Cave mine, so that's important. That's not risk facing us. We are addressing the seismicity issue at the Deep MLZ. Early indications are that this fracking approach, which we've never used, but is common technology in the industry, is going to be very effective in dealing with that issue for us going forward. So, that's a major positive. So, milestones to watch. Beginning in the second half of 2019, we began block caving mining in the Grasberg Block Cave. That's very similar to \u2013 it's big, but it's very similar to what we've been doing now since early 1980s. We know the rock fully drilled, same rock that we mine from the pit. So, you'll be able to see the results of that in the second half of the year, the beginning results of it. And then, as we continue with this fracking operation in the Deep MLZ, we'll see the consequence of that, but we're really encouraged about it right now. So, how do I answer your question? There's always risk in mining. There's always risk in underground mining. But, Mark, why don't you...? Mark J. Johnson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah, just to elaborate a little bit on the GBC. We announced last quarter that we commissioned the ore flow system, which was the big crushing/conveying system. We continue to ramp up the rail system, which \u2013 what delivers ore from the mine to the mill or to the ore flow system, and that's ramping up as expected. We took our first undercut blast in September, a little ahead of schedule. And in January, we do our first drawbell in the Grasberg Block Cave, and that continues to ramp up. The GBC, Grasberg Block Cave, is a little different than some of our other block caves, in that we have multiple working areas. And so, we're paging the \u2013 ramp the same process throughout three different areas over 2019. The Deep MLZ, as Richard mentioned, the hydrofracking is working very well. We're seeing the seismic response that we would like. We're getting the seismic stresses away from our working areas and above the cave, and we're seeing good signs that the cave is propagating vertically, which is what we hope for and it's a very optimistic start. Big Gossan, we don't talk about that a lot, but we're ramping it up to full production of 7,000 tonnes a day by the fourth quarter of 2019, and that's about a year ahead of schedule that we had a year ago. And then the DOZ, we don't look past it. It's still a significant producer. We're continuing to advance the remote mining associated with the wet material that we're dealing with. And we're very encouraged by that. We've had \u2013 this last week we're well over 40,000 tonnes a day, and that's where we need to be next year. So those are the milestones that I see. The mill next year won't be a constraint. Power systems, we're going to be doing a lot of maintenance, as needed, and being prepared for the ramp-up 2020 and 2021. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Mark. Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: This has been very helpful. I appreciate all the detail on this and best of luck. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question... Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: I was just going to say, in the interest of time, if we could limit people's questions to one, so we can move through this. We've got a list of people in the queue, so... Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead. Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, Richard and Kathleen. Richard, in your prepared remarks, you talked about that you were slowing down some investments. I guess, could you be more specific there, if possible, in terms of investments or projects that you're slowing down and also kind of the cadence of (00:56:56). Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So it's not... Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Alex, maybe I wasn't clear, but it's not really slowing down things. It's when do we initiate investments. I mean, we're continuing with our Grasberg underground development, the Lone Star project, and so forth. So, we haven't really slowed those things down. We're, obviously, looking at costs and constraining them in this uncertain market environment. But the issue is, when do we start major new projects on our resources and we've deferred the decision to start those until we get market clarity. And that would include our potential large scale project at El Abra in Chile, where with our partner Codelco we've completed pre-feasibility. It's an attractive project, lots of capital. We've got projects in the United States at various of our mines, including a mill expansion at our Bagdad mine in Northwest Arizona. So, what we slowed down is pulling the trigger to start, but that's where we are. Alexander Hacking - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That makes sense. Thanks for the clarification. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Okay, good Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Richard, just wanted to ask to get a bit of color just from some of the recent media articles, where you've been interviewed. It seems to suggest that the company is open to a sale. And I'm just curious how to think about that, given your earlier comments about just all the resources you have on the ground and all the future projects and sort of how undervalued you are. Can you maybe offer a bit of context on those comments? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: I'm glad to. Thank you for your question. So, as most of you probably have noted, as we've been in negotiation over this extended period in Indonesia, other than our earnings call and investor conferences, I have really not been giving interviews to the media like I used to. Trying to encourage our partners in Indonesia also to not do this. So, around LME, with the signing of this agreement, I've given a number of interviews, including one interview where at the very end of a large interview I was asked the question \u2013 I didn't bring it up \u2013 that there had been some comments in the marketplace that Freeport could potentially be acquired. I have a stock answer to that. I'm saying, we have no plans to sell the company, we're focused on our internal business. Two, as a public company, we're going to be open to opportunities for our shareholders as they evolve in the future and that would be a wide range of opportunities that we might have. And so it was a stock answer, one I've given for years, one I'll continue to give. And in my view it was mischaracterized in headlines in the way this thing was talked about. I personally do not believe that in today's world with these uncertainties, there are opportunities for big M&A transactions in the industry. I certainly don't consider it to be something that we would look at in the near term, given our share price. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Okay, perfect. So it's not something you're actively pursuing? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: No. And like I said, I don't think in today's world with all these uncertainties, I think it's unlikely that anybody's going to be pursuing big scale deals. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And just one clarification. In slide 23, the Grasberg mine plan, can you maybe explain how come the gold at 1.9 million ounces in 2022 is the same when you show it on 100% basis versus including Rio's share and then PT-FI share, whereas obviously the copper is different, I assume, because of the metal sharing agreement. But does that not apply to the gold in that year? Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: It also applies to gold. It's just that when you look at the years 2019 through 2021, the production is less than the metal strip. And when you get to 2022, there is some sharing in copper. But the way the metal strip works for gold, all the gold in 2022 is \u2013 substantially all the gold in 2022 is for PT-FI's interest. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So there is different metal strip for copper and gold. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: These metal strips were decided (01:01:59) in 1996, 1997, and they were just fixed. And so that's just the way it works. It was based on the old mine plan with old government capacity. And it was just a complicated part of that original agreement with Rio Tinto. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Okay. And just finally, will you be continuing to consolidate Grasberg when this definitive agreement is completed or are you going to change sort of the way you start reporting this? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So that's an issue we're currently studying as we complete this deal. Normally, in consolidation, 51% is the criteria for share ownership. This is different, because we have base control over operations through the structure in the shareholders' agreement. So, it is something that we're considering now. I'll tell you this, in terms of meeting our objectives, Freeport's objectives, of having authority to control the operations of the business, we're very satisfied with the way this thing ended up. And when we have time with investor meetings and so forth, we can go through that in some detail, but we have an operating committee that FCX controls and its authority is broad and effective in terms of running the business. Orest Wowkodaw - Scotia Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thanks. And I'll just ask again to limit to one question, if possible. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: And get back in the line if you have time, so... Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Oscar Cabrera with CIBC. Please go ahead. Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Well, my three questions became two and now one, but that's fair enough. So, getting back to capital allocation, disciplined approach is great. Balance sheet appears to be where you want it to be, but you're still generating strong cash flows from operations. So can you talk a little bit more about returning cash to shareholders with share buybacks that some of your mining peers are doing be considered in that? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So, well, Oscar, while we met our targets in the uncertainties with today's world, excess cash flows will continue to be used to reduce debt. Our cash flows will fall off in these transition years, so we face that circumstance. And then with these uncertainties in the overall marketplace that I talk about with Chris' question initially, that's going to make us conservative and cautious about financial policy. So, we're going to be solid with what we're doing and it's driven by both, the circumstances in the marketplace and our company's situation of having these transition years. But when we look beyond that, then we'll have lots of opportunities to do different things. Oscar Cabrera - CIBC World Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Richard. So, I'll get back in the queue. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : Congratulations on all the good progress and people even asking about buybacks. In terms of El Abra and Bagdad potential projects that might move ahead in better times, roughly, how many metric tons per day might the mills be at El Abra or Bagdad, roughly? Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: At El Abra, we're looking at roughly the size of Cerro Verde 2, 240,000 tonnes a day, and at Baghdad... Harry M. \u201cRed\u201d Conger IV - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: 120,000 tonnes. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: As you hear Red, 120,000 tonnes. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: 120,000 tonnes, John. Now, these aren't equivalent projects. First of all, El Abra in Chile has a 49% partner. We have 51%. It will involve a major desalinization plant and the infrastructure to pump that water to elevation with attendant energy costs associated with it. It's a great resource, but it's a bigger project. At Bagdad, benefits from no taxes as we go forward. We've for years made plans for developing water resources for it, tailings areas. And so, it's a smaller project in the aggregate. We own 100% of it. We own the land and sea there. It's a remote area, great relationships with local community, straightforward type project. So, those are the tradeoffs. And then in the U.S., we have the benefit of attractive energy cost today, good regulatory environment, a workforce that is supported by the community in terms of housing, education, and healthcare, and so forth. People drive their trucks to work, bring their lunch. So there's a lot of tradeoffs, John, that go into those decisions. And over the years \u2013 and you remember like I too well when the Southwest copper district was considered totally dead. With all those changes today, it is very attractive. John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC : Thank you. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Brian MacArthur - Raymond James Ltd.: Good morning. You brought up the tax advantage a few times. So just very quickly, can you remind me where we are on tax pools in each of the regions? So if I'm looking for after tax cash flow or cash cost per unit of copper, I mean, you're sort of saying it's 10% or less in the U.S., it's 35% in Peru and Chile, and 50% in Indonesia. I'm just trying to see the next couple of years if you have lower Indonesia earnings or whatever, how that's all going to blend in and you're going to generate after tax cash flow? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So, we're unlike many other global companies, in that we pay higher taxes outside the U.S., whereas many companies before tax reform paid higher taxes in the U.S. We're taxed individually in those countries and those tax rates, in Indonesia there's a 35% corporate income tax. There's a 10% withholding tax that's additional to that for funds that come out of Indonesia, and then you have the royalties that you have there. So all of that's there. In the U.S., we have a very large tax loss carryforward, so that our tax rate for a long time will be zero. And when that expires many years in the future, under the current tax laws, the effective tax rate on our operations in the U.S. would be about 11%. And that's because percentage depletion was retained under tax. And so that's where we are. In South America ... Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: It's around 35%, yeah. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: You're right. Brian MacArthur - Raymond James Ltd.: And those are cash taxes, right, as opposed to effective accounting taxes? Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Correct. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah, we write checks internationally like everybody else. Brian MacArthur - Raymond James Ltd.: Perfect, great. It's just you brought it up and said it's \u2013 your, obviously, cash flow is going down, but your after tax is being somewhat more efficient across the U.S. versus Indonesia as we go forward, right? So it's not going down at first if you look... Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, the U.S. production is not going down \u2013 our U.S. production and South America production is not going down. It's only... Brian MacArthur - Raymond James Ltd.: Right, right. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: ...Indonesia and that will be shielded, to a degree, by taxes there. That's an important thing in looking at the smelter obligation too. The smelter costs will have a tax effect associated with it. Brian MacArthur - Raymond James Ltd.: Great, thanks. And that's all embedded, which I assume is why when you look at that chart on page 13, you see the EBITDA over the transition years compressing down and the average operating cash flow, it doesn't go down as much as you think, because you're getting all those tax benefits. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, yeah, tax consequence... Brian MacArthur - Raymond James Ltd.: For tax consequence. So it's not a benefit, I get it. Okay. Great. That's very helpful. Thank you very much. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thank you, Brian. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Looking at your capital spending plan over the next few years in the chart, I noticed the increase in the maintenance or non-growth spending. Is that all catch-up? Is there some equipment squeeze or any unusual opportunities that you're going to see there for the next few years or are you anticipating higher vendor prices for what you're going to be investing? Thank you. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Well, some of it is we had deferred maintenance during 2015, 2016, into 2017, so some of it is catch-up. But this is \u2013 I mean, these are very reasonable levels of maintenance capital for operation our size. There's nothing unusual there and we've done some great things like \u2013 Red, when's the last time we bought a truck? Harry M. \u201cRed\u201d Conger IV - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: 2008, a new one. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: A new truck in 2008. We rebuild all of our trucks. We've got great deals with our tire \u2013 we're constantly working with our suppliers to mitigate cost increases. And when you step back from this, this is a very reasonable level of maintenance cost for an operation of this size and this nature. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah. And to answer the latter part of your question, we're not seeing, of course, only edges (01:12:16). We've always got cost inflation to manage and work with our vendors, but that's not the reason why we've got capital where it is. It's more this effort to sustain our operations, rebuild the equipment, add equipment to increase mining rates, and which we believe will drive long term value. Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you, all. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Co.: Hi, everybody. Thanks. Just a quick question. In the North America operations, you're saying that the costs there were a little bit higher in the quarter because of higher mining rates. And, Richard, you kind of referenced this in your opening comments that you're mining more now relative to what you were doing when you were trying to cut costs. Is this laybacks at some of the mines and is it \u2013 when these are completed, will the unit costs come back down in North America? And then also, is there an opportunity to reopen the Miami mine? Those are my two questions. Harry M. \u201cRed\u201d Conger IV - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So, Chris, this is Red. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Co.: Hi. Harry M. \u201cRed\u201d Conger IV - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: The mining rates are at levels that we can sustain long-term, gives us the flexibility to be able to blend ores and all those kinds of things are important to us and higher copper prices and longer term outlook for those mines, and the cost will come down a bit as we get all of that dialed in. We are playing catch-up. Right now, we constantly look at the resources that we have. We don't see anything out in the future for Miami, but it's not off the list either. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah. We have an ongoing program of environmental management there and when we discuss with other operators in the area things that might be possibilities. We are very encouraged about our Chino mine in New Mexico, which we thought it would be completed by now, but we're finding resources at depth. So, we started this Cobre project there to help current operations. Our guys are doing a great job managing that currently and it has some potential for the future as well. Christopher Domenic Mancini - Gabelli & Co.: Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Matt Murphy with Barclays. Please go ahead. Matt Murphy - Barclays Investment Bank : Hi, Richard. Just another question on the pipeline in the Americas. I'm interested in what you think your response time could be. If at some point you feel more comfortable on the copper price outlook, how quickly you could put some of these options into production? Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So I think the most shovel-ready-type project we have is at Bagdad and it's five, six, seven, eight years from pulling the trigger to go to getting production out of it. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Now, you've seen the Lone Star... Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Yeah. Kathleen L. Quirk - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: ...production that we're expecting to come online at the end of 2020. And as Richard was talking about earlier, as we strip, we're really going to expose additional oxides, and there could be a project at Lone Star to increase from 200 million to higher rates. We'd have to put in some additional tank house capacity, but that one could be quicker in terms of adding volumes, because we think the resources there adding some capacities, that will be quicker than putting in a new mill, for instance. So Lone Star keep on the radar for potential increases to the 200 million that we've got at the end of the 2020 period. Matt Murphy - Barclays Investment Bank : Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Oh, hey, good morning. Thanks for letting me in. Just one question. I wanted to ask if you could please give us an update on any details regarding the Grasberg smelter. I noticed a small change in language between the two releases. And also as you were talking about cash flow expectations for the next several years, I didn't hear a mention of the smelter. So, if you could just provide us your latest thinking on timing, cost, and split with Inalum, that would be great. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: So, it is the commitment of our companies that with the completion of the extension, the documentation, the resolution of the environmental issues, all of this comes together as a package at one time; the share transfers, the shareholders' agreement, all of that, it's a one-time closing of a number of these different things. And with that completed, we will undertake to fulfill our commitment of PT-FI to build the smelter. It would be on a standalone basis to enhance the $3 billion project. We've said we would do this and we are committed to do this within five years of signing this document. It would be a commitment of PT-FI, so Inalum would be 50% owner of that commitment and they've agreed to participate in any equity capital calls that might be required for that. We have plans to develop a project-type financing with that, as we did with the existing smelter back in the 1990s. And so we would proceed to maximize project-type debt financing probably or financing through PT-FI to minimize upfront capital for it. Then we have the potential of bringing other partners into this. We're having discussions with PT Amman, which acquired the Batu Hijau mine from Newmont. They face the smelter commitment and we're having ongoing discussions with them about participating with us, and that has the potential of reducing \u2013 increase the size of the smelter, but decrease the capital requirements for our company. Going back to the earlier conversation about tax effects; big picture, currently the government gets about 50% of the economics of the projects through taxes and royalties. They now have 50% of the equity. So, 75% of all this is the government now. I mean, our 25% interest is potentially what we had under the Rio Tinto deal and so forth. So, all these numbers you need to take into account that the effect of the smelter will be reduced by tax consequences and by the government's participation in it. So, we've spent couple of hundred million dollars today in planning. We're working with contractors. And with completion of the deal, we'll move forward with construction, contract plans, and so forth, and we'll be able then to lay out a cash flow profile for what will be required, how it would be financed, and what capital commitments will be for us. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And completed within five years or begun within five years, my just one clarification. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Completed within five years. We will commence \u2013 I mean, we're doing planning now, but we'll commence the project immediately on issuance of the new license and completion of all these other transactions is part of the package. Timna Beth Tanners - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you very much. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : I will now turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. Richard C. Adkerson - Freeport-McMoRan, Inc.: All right. Thanks, everyone. Appreciate your interest. If you have follow-up questions, get back to David Joint, and we'll be moving on and upward. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our 2017 Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. On the call today are Richard Adkerson, Red Conger, and Mike Kendrick. We also have Mark Johnson who has dialed into the call from our site in Papua, Indonesia. I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results, and then turn the call over to Richard, who'll be reviewing our performance and outlook and using the prepared slide materials that are available on our website. Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $140 million, or $0.09 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2018 and $2.3 billion or $1.55 per share for the full year 2018. We had a number of special nonrecurring items in the quarter, these are detailed on Page \u2013 Roman numeral VII of our press release the charges netted to a net charge of $21 million or $0.02 a share. They included $331 million in charges related to disputed Cerro Verde royalty claims and some charges at PT-FI. These were largely offset by $310 million in tax credits and gains on asset sales. Excluding these net charges, our adjusted fourth quarter net income totaled $161 million or $0.11 per share. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA, for fourth quarter 2018 totaled $885 million and we've got a reconciliation on Page 33 of our slide deck providing the EBITDA calculation. Our fourth quarter production totaled 841 million pounds of copper and 334,000 ounces of gold. Our production was higher than our sales which totaled 785 million pounds of copper and that was similar to our October 2018 guidance, but our gold sales of 266,000 ounces were about 64,000 ounces below our 2018 guidance. And this is purely a timing issue related to a delay in shipments at PT-FI late in the quarter associated with some unscheduled maintenance at the third-party operated Gresik smelter in Indonesia. So these sales were deferred from the fourth quarter. They will be shipped in the first quarter, but they had an approximate $80 million impact on our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA, this was just for the gold deferral. For the year, our sales of copper totaled 3.8 billion pounds, sales of gold totaled 2.4 million ounces and we sold 94 million pounds of molybdenum. Our fourth quarter realized price for copper was $2.75 per pound and that was 14% below the year ago quarterly average of $3.21 per pound. Gold realized prices in the quarter was $1255 per ounce and that compared to $1285 per ounce in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Our unit cost net of byproduct credits on a consolidated basis averaged $1.54 per pound of copper and a $1.7 for the full year. Operating cash flows for the year totaled $3.9 billion and those exceeded our capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion. We ended the year in a strong position from a cash liquidity position. We ended the year $4.2 billion of cash and consolidated debt totaled $11.1 billion. We have no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the materials, the slide presentation materials on our website. Richard Adkerson : Good morning everyone in a very complicated world today, politically and economically and we have a lot of excitement here to report among our management team and globally across our organization. We had a very active year in 2018 and it was culminated by the completion of our transactions with the Government of Indonesia on December 21st. And this is a - frankly a heavy load lifted off as we've been dealing with this for a number of years and in this process, particularly over the past three years in such a positive way is very gratifying. Now we're focused on 2019 and the years beyond that. Some of our accomplishments in 2018 start with the fact that globally we had a very safe and productive year in our operations. If you look back three years ago, 2015, 2016, when commodity prices were very low, the outlook was very weak. As a company we had a heavy debt burden and it wasn't clear how we're going to deal with that, but in the Americas at that time to conserve cash we ramped down our mining operations and this past year we restored mining operations to establish ourselves for our long-term future of productivity in those mines. We ramped up our mining activities by nearly 20% and this is going to support our long-term mine plans and preserve our optionality as we go forward. That's like building a new mine when you think about the 20% of an operation this size. We advanced the construction of a new mine at Lone Star. This is an ore resource that joins our Safford mine. That mine was just getting started when Freeport acquired Phelps Dodge in 2007. It has processing capacity that we're able to utilize productively with developing this new resource. And we continue to drill the Lone Star ore body and resources and really are identifying a massive new resource which will be good for the future of our company, be great for the future of our company. This mine is located just across the mountain ridge from Morenci in Eastern Arizona. Our mill at Cerro Verde continues to hit new records. This is not the largest milling complex in the world, one of the very largest since we began its operations it has just performed magnificently and continues to do so. At our Bagdad mine in Northwest Arizona, we have a very interesting process this year where we completed an efficiency project using Big Data and artificial intelligence models its lifted productivity with this mine in a low capital-intensive way and now we're going to take that experience and carry it forward to our other mines. We increased our reserves in the Americas by over 35%. For too long we've held on to using a $2 dollar copper price to determine reserves, we increased that to $2.50 and while this increases the proved and probable reserves that we'll report to the SEC it is also going to be very beneficial as we look to the future when we develop these assets to create additional value for our shareholders out of these operations. In Indonesia, we made really important progress in preparing our underground mines for the future. This is the future because we will complete mining from the Grasberg pit this year in 2019 the first half of this year. For over a 15-year period now we've been developing this infrastructure including the installation of the state-of-the-art underground rail and overflow systems and we've developed the infrastructure necessary for large-scale underground mining. This is \u2013 we are addressing the size seismicity issues for mining that we've encountered at the separate Deep MLZ mine and the results with that data are encouraging and we're gaining increasing confidence about our ramp-up plans for the Deep MLZ. Over the next two years now we've been foreshadowing these two years for ever since we developed our long-term mine plans at Grasberg in the mid-1990s, we've been foreshadowing the fact that there would be a transition period as we complete mining in the pit and ramp-up production from two large-scale high-grade underground mines. And we expect production in the Grasberg district will double between 2019 and 2021 and this has always been our plan, but now we got \u2013 we've de-risked the infrastructure development. The transition years are here. This is equivalent to a new startup operation for our mine. We've completed the open pit here and now we're in the underground area. It's a major undertaking that our team has carefully planned over the years and is now executing and it is all going on schedule. I personally cannot be more pleased with the outcome of our negotiations with the Indonesian Government, all three parties, the Government of Indonesia, our former joint venture partner Rio Tinto and Freeport accomplished each of our fundamental objectives. And for those of you who follow us, you recognize this was no easy feat in the complicated circumstances we faced. But at the end of the day, all of us were happy. We were successful in maintaining for Freeport the basic economics of this ore body and the deal that we have going forward is roughly equivalent, approximately equivalent to the economics we had under our contract work and it maintained, sustains our exposure to this world-class asset, world's second largest copper mine, and world's largest gold mine, it's a remarkable asset and really worth all the effort that we poured into it over the years. Really important in this process is we ended the tough, tough negotiations on a positive note. We now have a new partnership structure that strongly aligns Freeport's interest with the Government. For all these years we've been on the opposite side of the table in really an unproductive way. I'm convinced that this will mitigate political risk as we go forward and other major risks related to everything from security to labor relations, community relations. We now have aligned interest. We are partners with a state-owned company. That state-owned company has incurred significant debt to finance this transaction. Just like we, they will be looking to have positive cash flows coming out of this business over time to service that debt and to provide dividends of substance to the Government for years to come. As a company, I look back three years ago and think of just about how bad our situation was then with markets and with our debt position. Over that time we've reduced our debt. We're in a strong financial and liquidity position, and the steps taken to reduce our debt by nearly two thirds were way beyond the targets we set at this call two years ago, position us now to manage this transition in Indonesian and deal with the market uncertainties that we may face. We'll talk more about this, but on the call and answer your questions. You know, the fundamentals even today with all the confusion economically in the world and with all the risk that we hear about every day, the fundamentals of the copper market point to a very positive future. In our company and our management team are managing our company's assets to enable our shareholders to benefit significantly from what I'm confident will be strong copper markets ultimately in the future. With today's uncertainties in the global marketplace, neither we nor anyone else can predict short-term movements in copper prices. But our management team is confident and we have the right portfolio of assets, the right structure and we've de-risked so much of our business over the past three years and particularly in 2018 that we can deliver significant values over the long-term to our shareholder. So, we are going to now answer your questions about the past if you have any, I'm sure you will, but we are going to focus on what's ahead of us in the future. It's all about execution now. Our team recognizes that. We are focused on it. We have a great track record of executing in project development and operations and now we're going to use those capabilities to build success. When I sit back and look at it today's world is confused in many respects and dysfunctional. We're not confused at Freeport and we're going to be functional. We know what we need to do and we're going to set out to do it. So, turning to the slides now, Kathleen has reviewed the 2018 highlights, just a couple of comments. We had this problem with the smelter in Gresik being down. We had 130,000 tons of concentrate that we had produced at Grasberg that was in inventory in our concentrate bonds at Grasberg, normally it is 20,000, so 100,000 tons of concentrate that was produced, otherwise would have been sold if Gresik had been up. We had 60 million pounds of copper and 100,000 ounces of gold that's not in our numbers this year. Copper prices dropped $0.12 in December. Much of our production for the year is priced at December prices. We've put out a guidance note for our analysts who publish earnings guidance in December. I would encourage you to read that note and apply it. Several analysts didn\u2019t do it this year and that resulted in the expectations about earnings being higher than it otherwise would have been. So anyway, past is past. We're focusing on the future, Slide 4, summarizes the transaction with the Government of Indonesia. Importantly for our financial reporting purposes, because of the structure of our shareholders' agreement with Inalum, the state owned company, Freeport will continue to consolidate PT-FI and PT-FI is now larger because previously we separated the interest in the joint venture between Freeport and Rio Tinto, now all of that is part of PT-FI. All of that will be in our consolidated results. And our consolidated reserves will be higher as a result of that report. FCX's equity interest in the reserves will be equivalent, will be the same. But those are details and if you have questions we will answer about it. Now, turning to priorities, here's what we're going to do. We're going to ramp-up production from our large-scale underground mines at Grasberg. Two basic mines, although the Grasberg Block Cave has two headings in some ways could be viewed as two bonds within the Grasberg ore body and the Deep MLZ mine. We're going to focus on productivity and cost management globally in the Americas as well as in Indonesia. We're going to advance this Lone Star development and continue to look at the very exciting long-term expansion opportunities of that ore body. And then we're going to look at other future growth opportunities from our large portfolio of reserves and resources. We have a great opportunity in Chile with our El Abra mine and then we have a number of opportunities in the U.S. mines. We're going to be evaluating them and ranking them and be prepared to go forward when markets give us the comfort to go forward. We're not going to be spending capital in those in the near term. So copper markets, you know in the face of all the investment - investor uncertainties that come about for obvious reasons that still retain their concerns about the ultimate risks to the economy in China and the global economy from a number of items, including the unfortunate trade policy issues that are being considered now. The fundamentals in the marketplace remain very strong. China set records for copper imports. They are continuing to invest in smelting capacities. They are reducing scrap going into China. There's just a lot of things about China. China as a country has enormous financial resources. They are looking at stimulating their economy, investing in one road initiatives. China has lots of alternatives of dealing with issues it faces in the current marketplace. Time will tell whether this will develop into a serious problem and we'll be prepared for that. But today, the outlook going forward is good. In the U.S. it is really amazing, we supply maybe a third of the copper to the downstream market. We're stretched. We're not being able to commit - to meet all the commitments of our U.S. customers. We actually have to go out and buy some copper. Can you imagine that Freeport, the world's largest operator of copper mines is having to buy some copper to fulfill customer demands in the U.S. All of this is really contrary to investor sentiment, investor sentiment is what it is. We live with it. But the market is fundamentally continues to be strong and then we look forward. We look at the declines in base production, you know experts are analyzing that to be over 5% over the next 10 years. If you look at modest demand growth, if we use 1.5% over the next 10 years you end up needing almost 5 million pounds of new copper per year, 5 million tons of new copper per year. And today it takes prices well over $3 a pound to justify new investments. So there's coming times when copper prices will simply have to rise. And then you look at where is today's copper coming from. And on Slide 7, the slide you've seen from us before you see the reserves in production from the top 10 copper mines in the world today, we have three of the five largest producing mines in the world. In aggregate those mines only produced 5.4 million tons a year in 2018. So you come back having to replace all of these mines 10 years out, it's a good outlook. So here's what our reserves are. We have \u2013 I've been talking with our team for some time now about why do we continue to use $2 copper. So we've changed to $2.50 copper in the Americas and that resulted in about a quarter increase in our reserves just by using that price. And that's not just an accounting exercise. That's helping us as we look to see where we rank these investment opportunities going forward. That's proved and probable reserves under SEC industry standards. Beyond that we have an equivalent amount of mineralized material associated with our existing mines that with additional drilling analysis, engineering planning and so forth could well come into reserves. Half of these resources roughly are in the U.S. So we are positioned as a company to benefit from this coming positive copper markets and have the ability to deal with it if in fact we have to deal with economic weakness. More information on reserves are shown on Page 9 and most of the additions that came about are in the Americas. We doubled our reserves at Bagdad which is a really attractive future investment opportunity mine for us. We've added significant reserves to Morenci. We've added reserves at Cerro Verde. Our reserves will also grow because the consolidation, the inclusion of the former Rio Tinto interest into PT-FI and the continued consolidation of PT-FI, big reserves, big resources. Cerro Verde, the operations are really going well. This is really a great mine. So glad we buckled up and made the decision to do the major expansion that we completed and started ramping it up three years ago. And the concentrator facilities, leading - industry-leading in size are performing well exceeding nameplate capacity and so this is a great mine, really pleased it is part of our portfolio. Lone Star, I mentioned there is a picture here. We're minding leachable oxide ore now, doing stripping. That's going to be a very profitable project for us. 5.6 billion pounds of copper, it's strictly leaching using the facilities that are already in place at the adjoining Safford mine. So that going to be a good project, but what's really exciting is beyond those 5.6 billion pounds of reserves now, we have 50 billion to 70 billion pounds of resources, enormous opportunity driven by the sulfide resources underneath these oxide resources that we're producing. We also have a sizable sulfide opportunity at Safford which has been to-date strictly a leaching operation. And so this has the opportunity of being a Morenci class mine as we go forward right in the heart of our operations in a community where they are welcoming mine activities part of the Brownfield expansion really exciting. Grasberg underground, this is just really going to be amazing. In the future as we look out beyond the ramp-up the primary asset is going to be the Grasberg Block Cave. Now this is the same ore body that we've been mining from the surface since early 1990s, not a different ore body. It is just physically, it is more economically to access it underground now from the surface. We'll be ramping this single underground mine. It will have two headings and Mark Johnson is on the call with us, it's late at night. He is in \u2013 came back for, but it's really in effect like two mines because it's two headings, ramping up to 130,000 tons a day from this ore body by 2023. We had our first drawbell blast on December 15. I was in Jakarta and that was exciting to be late at night at the Fairmont Hotel and watch that first blast go off on the screen and that's just one evidence of the progress we've made in developing the infrastructure. Now, it's important to note that his is an ore body we know. The Deep MLZ where we've had the mining and do seismic activities and separate mineralization area, an area where we began block cave mining in the early 1980s and have extended the depth, it is 1500 meters below the surface with 300 meters below the surface with the Grasberg Block Cave mine, different rock environment. We know the rock. We're comfortable that we won't have to deal with the conditioning exercises we're having to do at the Deep MLZ with the fracking operations. The Deep MLZ will be ramping up we feel confident to 80,000 tons a day by 2022. We began the fracking operations in 2018 to manage the seismic events, precondition the cave. This is not first time it's been done in the industry, first time we've done it and results to date are very encouraging and giving us increasing confidence about our ramp-up schedule. We have an inventory of 70 drawbells. So we are prepared to have this ramp-up going and we're giving you our estimate as to how we'll achieve which is shown here on Page 13. First half of 2019 we've basically finished at the bottom of the pit. We're looking out for opportunities to in the pit to get some incremental high grade ore as we finish mining in the pit. And one way we're doing that the primary way is we're mining out the ramp roads that have led down there is very hard grade and that will be the bulk of the source of our ore production during the first half of 2019, and then you can see in these schedules are the other mines will ramp-up. So we're into this transition period 2019-2020. We have an increasing confidence about our ability to meet our targets and we will end up with the Grasberg mine operating with totally underground feed with the mill of over 200,000 tons per day of very high grade copper and gold ore. And now the decks are cleared of all these issues that we've had with the government for us to proceed to do that in a business like fashion and it will be our primary focus. So we've got a global footprint of course are key parts of the companies that we operate all the assets and we have ownership interest in, you know we're not minority owners, we're not joint venture participants, but we have the ability to benefit from having a common operating group managing all these operations and that gives us lot of synergies to deal with both in supply chains and people and mine planning and so forth. The large part of our resource and reserves are in the Americas, 70%. We got a great team, real hot around here. Everybody is excited. We are ramping-up the operations today. We're planning for future development and all of us are happy about it. The leading position in the United States, you know looking back a number of years ago, mining the Southwest copper district was dead. Now it's really exciting. We got favorable tax situation. We have a huge operating loss carry forward from oil and gas investment. So taxes will be minimal in the U.S. going forward and improved regulatory environment. We have really good relationships with the states where we operate. And the energy situation in the U.S. with shale oil shale gas, flexibility of labor. We don\u2019t have labor unions here. We have communities that support the families that work at our business. So anyway it's \u2013 we're really excited about our business in the U.S. Great opportunity in Chile with El Abra, world-class mine in Peru and of course Indonesia being historically tremendous asset. We showed this I think last quarter, but I want to come back to it, about just how difficult it would be to replicate what we have here at Freeport. You know, if we look at the copper equivalent capacity of our company, 4.5 billion pounds of annual production extending for as far as you can see, the cost to develop Greenfield capacity is $8 to $10 a pound, that indicates that to replace what we already have now could be in the order of $35 billion to $45 billion. Time will justify this and we are focused on giving the market the bases to do it. So we got our 2019 outlook. It is very consistent with what we had before. Unit cost will be higher the next two year than they have been or will be because of the volumes with the transition at Grasberg and then will affect our cash flows for our two-year period, but this is just like someone starting up a new mine, whether that mine is in Mongolia or Africa or Panama or whatever. It is a ramp-up period and that's what we have. Capital expenditures are consistent with what we've got it to before. A large portion of these were related to projects, it'll be adding significant future production. You can see our sales profile which will be increasing as we go through the ramp-up years. And then gold sales is particularly evident of course that's Grasberg and that's where we're having the transition. Slide 17 shows the volumes in cost by region. Our cost in the Americas has been fairly consistent. Each mine will be affected by some volume differences, but the fundamental cost situation is under control and remaining the same. Consolidated cost we're showing at current commodity prices for 2019 to be a $1.73, but that's with Grasberg being at $1.55 a pound. We think Grasberg after the transition will be no more than $0.30, maybe lower depending on commodity prices and if we pro-forma for that our cost would be a $1.30 versus a $1.73. We just keep willing to drive home the fact that we're in a transition year. This is page 18, and it shows what our average EBITDA and operating cash flows will be on average for 2019 and 2020 and then after the ramp up how much it will grow. So I'll let you look at those numbers and I think they're evidence for what we're doing there. No significant changes to our capital expenditures. The bulk of our major mining projects are Grasberg underground development. And our financial policy, we are going to be studying and ranking future investment opportunities. We're not planning to commit major amounts of new capital to those projects. We're going to continue with Grasberg and with Lone Star, but we're going to be looking at attractive projects for the future. We're going to continue to be focused on improving our balance sheet to the extent we get the period where we're generating excess cash, maintaining our current dividend and what we're really looking forward to is having production ramp-up, more positive copper pricing environment and that will allow us the ability to pay cash dividends as has been our tradition at Freeport. So, that is where we are as I said in a complicated dysfunctional world in many respects. We are very excited about where we are and we are focused on moving forward to make our company really successful for our shareholders. So, Regina we\u2019ll open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Chris Terry : Hi, Richard and Kathleen. Two questions from me, the first one in your slide deck, Slide 27 where you've got the quarterly sales forecast for 2019, just looking for a little bit more color on the ramp-up of the two headers at the Grasberg underground presumably the first quarter of 2019 guidance the 825 million pounds includes a little bit of the sales that did not come true from 4Q 2018, I think 2Q 2019 from what you've said includes some of the open pit material at the slightly high grade is that really the second half of the year where we then more reliant [ph] completely on the underground, just trying to step through the profile there? That's the first question and just on your projects beyond Lone Star, can you rank at this stage what the order of preference would be for any new projects including El Abra or North American options? Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Okay, so Chris, you're exactly right. I mean you're reading the slides, the first half of the year the bulk of production at Grasberg is going to come from the open pit ramp mining and then by the end of the year the Grasberg Block Cave will be commencing production. We also over time have developed stockpiles of material that we will use to maintain as much throughput through our mill as we can, but that's been a long term plan to stockpile some lower than average grade material and that will be available for us as well. Kathleen Quirk : And for the year Deep MLZ represents about 12% of our production, so relatively small percentage in 2019 and Grasberg Block Cave is under 10% for 2019. The rest of it will come from the open pit. The DOZ mine which has been operated for several years now is the other piece of this in addition to stockpiles and a small amount from Big Gossan as well. Richard Adkerson : Mark, do you have anything to add to that, we [indiscernible]? Mark Johnson : No, that's perfect. We've also ramped up the Big Gossan and it'll be at full production of 7000 tons a day by the third quarter and it will consistently supply about just over 10% of the copper and about 4% to 5% of the gold. Richard Adkerson : So Chris, with regard to ranking I'd be careful because we can get some fairly heated discussions internally about that. We started out with a base I think with El Abra. It's \u2013 for a mine that felt by this time would be depleted and when we acquired Phelps Dodge almost 12 years ago now, our subsequent core drilling and exploration now since it gives a really exciting opportunity. We own 51% of that mine. Codelco is our partner and Codelco is very positive about expansion. On the other hand, the U.S. has the benefits of the - that I mentioned, energy cost, labor flexibility which Chile is recognizing is an impediment to that country's future in the mining industry now and we own 100% of the mines. We own the land and sea here. And our workers drive their pickup trucks to work and carry lunch pails and send their kids to community and state schools and have hospitals. So there are a lot of advantages in the U.S. Leading the pack right now in terms of timing would be Bagdad. We\u2019ve invested in water resources which is a constraint there. We've done some work on land rights for tailings disposal and it's less capital intensive, smaller, easy executional project. And then longer range we've got some very large projects to consider, Lone Star and at Morenci and even in New Mexico where our mines are very old, but as we can continue to keep drilling these old ore bodies we get excited about what we're seeing there. So it will be a horse race to decide what to do, not a decision we will reach. We'll continue our work throughout the year and report to you how that analysis is going. Chris Terry : Okay, thanks. Richard Adkerson : Alright, thanks Chris. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. David Gagliano : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I just, I had a quick question first of all on the capital spending for the Indonesia smelter, the slides obviously are before CapEx for the smelter and I know it's early days, when do you expect to start spending? Richard Adkerson : All right, so we have been spending some planning money to date, we will continue with that. Significant capital spending won't come into play until 2020. And we are now engaged in conversations about potential partners, about financing structure and how that will be dealt with. So we've deferred that until we got our deal done, the deal is done. We're now actively pursuing that project and you can expect updates through 2019 as we go forward, but not much in the way of capital during 2019. Kathleen Quirk : And David, we will just point out on Slide 19 where we show capital expenditures, those are consolidated. And now we're bringing in all the aggregate capital from Indonesia whereas the previous structure was Rio Tinto. Their contribution was not included in our capital. So our capital spending really from what our previous guidance has not changed. We'll get under the economic arrangement we have with our new shareholder we'll have them make a contribution similar to what Rio Tinto would have otherwise done, but that won't be netted in our capital like it had been before. And with respect to the smelter, as Richard said, we are focused on, we're doing the front end engineering right now and while we're in those planning stages, we are going to work to try to find partners that may be interested in off take or other participation in the smelter. Ideally we'd like to structure the smelter similar to what we did with the original smelter we build in Indonesia where. PT-FI provided a contract to a smelter, project company that used that contract to finance the smelter, but we don't know yet. This is all new in terms of getting the deal done in Indonesia. So as we go forward, we're going to look to minimize equity contributions from FCX and look to try to find financing for the smelter as long term as possible to reflect the long term nature of the assets and the amortization of the smelter will have over time. Richard Adkerson : And Dave, let me make a couple of side comments on all this. All of the issues related to capital allocations in the smelter were settled with Inalum during our negotiations. Rio Tinto was a great partner of ours since the mid 1990s, but there were some issues related to the smelter and cost allocations in the final years before they went up to 40% that were unresolved. We resolved those now and those are settled with Inalum in a fair way and in a way that was consistent with the Rio Tinto deal. And when you think about the smelter, Indonesia really is exposed to roughly 50% of the economics of the smelter through taxes and royalties. Now they have a 50% equity interest. So 70% to 75% of the economics of the smelter will be borne by the Government of Indonesia and Freeport's exposure to the smelter which in today's world and perceivable world will have an economic impact is limited to 25% to 30%. I think that's obvious, but I think it's something I just wanted to point out. David Gagliano : I appreciate the extra details and color, it's always helpful. Just one other quick question, if you could just take a step back, obviously commodity price is down, all the big producers are out saying there's really not any good projects out there and so I just wanted to ask if you could give us an update on your thoughts regarding M&A activity in the sector in general and where Freeport shakes out? Richard Adkerson : So Dave, you and others read what other companies say and there is a consensus across the industry among the diversified companies that puts copper as a top priority of every company. I mean every company talks about that. And yet, as you point out the opportunities for investments are very limited just because of geology and politics and the nature of the ore bodies that are available to the industry right now. So over time I think there will be a strong desire for companies to try to expand their copper business and they're going to be limited by their ability to do that through exploration and development activities and I think that will add to the value of Freeport's assets. We don't have any strategy about M&A that's been formally adopted. We're going to be in the marketplace, looking for ways to increase shareholder value and that is the total focus of our company as we go forward. My long career in this industry, my observation is M&A opportunities emerge, people get in trouble when they try to force M&A ideas into a company's strategy, but they tend to be more, the good ones tend to be more opportunistic like our acquisition of Phelps Dodge wasn't a strategy that we planned. It was an opportunity that emerged because of the circumstances of Phelps Dodge, the circumstances of Freeport, the circumstances in the financial marketplace at the time and I think that'll drive, what we do in the future, opportunities. David Gagliano : Okay, just to clarify, is Freeport would you say more of a buyer or a seller? Richard Adkerson : I can see strategy working either way. David Gagliano : Okay, thanks. Richard Adkerson : Well, having said that to be a buyer would be faces an uphill challenge with us because we have all these resources where we're not getting any credit for in our current valuation and if we create values in those undeveloped resources all of that goes to benefit our shareholders. If you buy anything you have to pay the other company shareholders something, so it would be a real uphill battle for us to find an acquisition opportunity that makes sense for us. David Gagliano : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Chris LaFemina : Hi, thank you for taking my question. Just first a couple of quick questions on the transition to Grasberg and then one on costs for the entire company. So it looks like you actually slightly increased your production guidance from the Deep MLZ for 2020 and 2021 is that just a function as being more confident in the results of the hydraulics fracturing or something else going on there? And I guess kind of along those lines, what milestones should we be looking for are you looking for at the Block Cave and at the Deep MLZ through 2019 and 2020 that would give you even further confidence in the kind of successful transition to the ramp-up and production from those assets. Richard Adkerson : Okay, so the changes at Deep MLZ are just part of the natural updates of outlooks and here at Freeport we don't have an annual planning process. We update our mine plans every quarter. Before - at the end of every quarter we have a meeting where all of our mine managers globally come in, analyze what\u2019s happened in the past quarter, how their plans were changed. And so it's a dynamic real-time updating and when you see adjustments like that that just reflects the information that came into the quarter. You won't see having these big adjustments based on annual planning process. Anyway, my experience has shown me it's best to stay on top of these things real-time and that's what we do. Kathleen Quirk : Mark, do you want to comment on its roughly 2000 tons a day, more in 2020 and 2021, do you want to comment on some of the progress we're making at Deep MLZ? Mark Johnson : Yes, really the only difference on that is that with the hydro fracing success that we've had, we\u2019ve began to pull the ore body now. We have them for the last three months and what's happening is, as we frac the ore body, we watch very closely the air gap between the muck pile and the cave back where that's very small in a lot of cases it's less than 5 meters. We pull the material to continue to open up the space for the ore body to continue to propagate. And so that came on quicker than what we had previously forecasted, so we're continuing to do that today. We have days now on the Deep MLZ with the developments material that we, that is in ore grade also and the pulling of the cave were up over 10,000 tons which is marginally above what we had forecast last quarter. So we're very optimistic on that. We continue to frac in that area that's going to be one of our key milestones. We just recently commissioned our second hydro fracing pump. We've got six drill rigs, supplying the holes for the two hydro fracing pumps. So for me the deep MLZ it will be continued, the milestones will be continued success on the hydro fracing and we'll begin undercutting. We're forecasting to begin undercutting again in the Deep MLZ in April. So that will be driven by this continued success on the drill holes in the fracing, that goes along with them. In the Grasberg it's, there's really, it's just a matter now of undercutting and blasting drawbells and we've gotten off to a good start there were slightly ahead. And we don't see any issues there we've got a lot of development already in place in the undercut that we'll be developing over the next three years really. So it's just a continued ramp up of that, the trains and ongoing state of commissioning, but we see good progress on that. The ore flow was commissioned back in 2018 and really nothing that we need to do with the ore flow system in the next couple of years to meet the increasing production. Chris LaFemina : So aside from the, aside from the seismic, the mining of the seismic activity in the DMLZ you haven't really had any significant operational surprises at the Block Cave or at the DMLZ it seems like things are going pretty well recently, is that fair to say? Richard Adkerson : Yes, that is, the fracking, we've seen a much better response than we first had anticipated the case propagating better than we anticipated vertically and were establishing this fracking along the perimeter of the cave to where we'll be able to successfully and safely advance the undercut, so it has gone slightly better than what we anticipated in the last forecast. Chris LaFemina : Thank you for that. And then, sorry, Richard just one last question from me on the pro forma cost guidance of a $1.30 per pound, obviously the reduction 2019 into that is due to Grasberg. But what should we, how should we think about unit costs in North America and at [indiscernible] I guess over the last five years there's been some pretty stiff cost inflation in both of those regions and is any of that reversible or are we kind of looking at knew, the current kind of cost rates are going to be the normalized run rates of those assets, how is that going to change over time? Richard Adkerson : So, part of what you've seen in recent years was this ramp up of mining activity that we were restoring these curtailments that we put in place back in 2015 and 2016 for financial reasons. Had we not done that Chris, we would have seen volumes fall off because we weren\u2019t mining at optimal rates to maintain production. So we've incurred some additional costs, I mean 20% ramp up involves a lot of people and equipment and so now we believe we've got it at roughly here red right. We've got it at really a stable operating rates and then we'll be just subject to the normal factors that affect call structures and to date we're not seeing anything like that, that's a major concern for us. We've done this great job with truck rebuilds. Red, was the last time we bought a haul truck? Red Conger : 2008, a brand new\u2026 Richard Adkerson : A brand new\u2026 Red Conger : We bought 150 of them over the last 12 years. Richard Adkerson : We've added 50 of them and so we're doing things like that. Our entire age is going great, so when you look past all the issues at Freeport have been related to the Indonesian contract and the transition underground. We've had a big part of our business has just been focused on nuts and bolts and doing a great job of that. Kathleen Quirk : So in that one third we\u2019ve got relatively stable costs in the Americas forecast. Chris LaFemina : Perfect. Thank you for that. Good luck. Richard Adkerson : I appreciate it Chris. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew Korn : Hi, good morning everybody. The question, when you think about your potential growth portfolio beyond that of Lone Star, the prospects you've outlined for Cerro Verde, Bagdad, Safford, et cetera. You laid out this incentive price of $3.30, I know it's probably the most challenging question for a mining company when you have a long lead time between cash investment and incremental revenues. But what does the market look like where you make that decision saying, yes it's time to put in this capital. Price is 3.30 it stays there a quarter, two quarters, you know practically is that enough and if not what is? Richard Adkerson : I don't think you can simplify, it it's not just like the price, the current price or whether it will last couple of quarters or not. We don't allow ourselves to focus on a price. That's what history has taught me. We look at a scenario of prices. We don't think that you're going to get to a price analysts used to get upset when because with me, because they said what's your long term price and I say we don\u2019t have one. What we would do as we look at these projects is look at the market, see what the opportunity would create for us if we did the project and got those volumes and had the benefit of the prices that were available and then we would risk it. We would say okay, if you make that investment prices drop not on that project alone but how would that fit in to your total portfolio of assets? What would that do to the company? Is the company financially strong enough and we're so much better now than we have been. And how we fit in? We've benefited back, we undertook three projects at once coming out of the 2008, 2009 downturn. We did an expansion of thinking expansion at Morenci, the major expansion at Cerro Verde. And we looked at all of those and strategically we come back to the fact that you've got Grasberg there with this high volumes and significant cop a go component giving you this long line, low cost reserve. That was the whole basis for the Phelps Dodge deal. So as we look at future opportunities, we go this base for the company of Grasberg there is now de-risk in a major, major way to support our company and that will allow us to be more aggressive in terms of looking at those investments. It s not looking at them on a standalone basis. So, I can't give you a formula, but is we hopefully get past these trade issues and the Brexit and the government shutdown and get some clarity on what the Fed's interest rate policies are going to be and what the global economy is going to be and how China deals, all these things they'll come together and they'll give us a view as to what's the time to start these. You correctly pointed out they are very long term investments. The price of copper jumped to $5 today, we would have significant incremental production for six, seven years and so there's going to be a coming time, unless there's some really disaster economically in China and the world where you're likely to see really, really high copper price. I mean it's just, you just read the tea leaves, look at these basic numbers and say, how are you going to replace the top 10 mines in the world in 10 years. That's not going to come from what's on the schedule right now. The prices have got to go way up. People are going scrambling to produce copper. We've got the resources to do it in a productive way and that's what the future is going to be. Kathleen Quirk : The other thing we're doing in for our North American projects is, we're going through some work right now, some technical work to try to bring down the capital intensity of investments and that we\u2019re working on some of concentrator designs that may allow us to bring in projects from the lower capital intensity standpoint than what just a conventional technology would bring. So we want to get the results of that, those studies done and in the meantime we're doing some value engineering on the El Abra feasibility study so that we can be in a position to make decisions and rank these projects and sequence them in a way that drives the most value for our company. So we've got the inventory, but we want to do them in the most economic way that we can and so we're going through some time during this market uncertainty to study ways to bring down the capital intensity of the projects. Matthew Korn : Thanks Kathleen. Richard Adkerson : And this is a team that was a world leader in [indiscernible] and SAG mill development, high pressure grinding mill development, the development of Tinchi [ph] was technically industry leading and now with this new mill design that we did at Morenci. All of that's coming together to allow us to look at the next stage of how do you do these things with less capital, less energy, less carbon emissions, all the things that better recoveries. Better recoveries and now using this big data analysis project that we've done at Bagdad, that's what we've got to this company is going to be about and I really look forward to having earnings calls talking about these things rather than negotiations with governments. Matthew Korn : Thanks, I appreciate that. That leads to my next question. I wanted to ask a little bit on the CapEx side, Slide 19 we see the other mining creep up a bit $800 million to $1 billion by 2020. The major project holding at $1.5 billion over 2019 and 2020 although, price per call did $900 million, Lone Star declines by $200 million. So given what you just said, could you break down what regions which mines are driving a little bit of a pop and the other mining whether we should be thinking about a $1 billion consolidated as the standard capital going forward and then as you're getting to 2020 what else is popping into that major projects bucket? Richard Adkerson : Well, so with the sustaining capital some of that affects this ramp-up effect that we talked about. Not only you can constrain operations we choked by necessity, maintenance capital, and I mean these quarter meetings we had was, back and forth between the teams and our Kathleen and the financial staff, and so now we're having to go back and do some things that we had deferred and that's all that that is. And so, I think the sustaining capital that you see in those years should be more normal and we'll find ways to try to reduce it. There won't be any unexpected increases right, all right write that down. That won\u2019t be coming in there. And then by 2020 we may well have clarity on where we're going next with El Abra, Bagdad and other things that we'll be dealing with. So we'll just, we'll be updating, the milestones will be apparent to all of you now, because every quarter we're going to be talking about it. And that's the way this will unfold. Kathleen Quirk : There's not anything major besides the underground and Safford, Lone Star. We do have some capital at El Abra that we're doing the next phase of the new leach pad at [indiscernible] to extend the life of our software [ph] project there. So it's the bulk of it is coming from Safford, I mean Lone Star and Grasberg underground. Matthew Korn : All right, best of luck guys. Richard Adkerson : Thanks Matt. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead. Alex Hacking : Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. I guess, just following up on Indonesia, my first question, I noticed that the mining rights have been extended through 2031 at a 10-year period, not 2041. Was that always expected to be the case? And then secondly, the extension there was contingent on building the smelter and I guess paying taxes and royalties and any other contingencies on that extension? Thanks. Richard Adkerson : Okay, no we always knew that because of Indonesian mining law and regulations that we had to do 10 by 10 two 10-year and part of the negotiations were and that was the case with old contract, that was a primary term to 2021 then we had rights to 2041 in two 10-year increments, past 2021. So we always knew we had to deal with that, a focused area of negotiations where what was going to be the contingencies for that 2031 to 2041 and we ended up agreeing that there would be very specific criteria and we said that with those criteria met it would be automatic and those criteria are simply this. We pay our taxes and royalties, pay what's due, we build a smelter. Other than that, there's no environmental review or other administrative, no - we thought we could all come with our rights on to the cab, but the - the Indonesian Government had to grant those extensions without unreasonable - without any unreasonable delay. There are no reasonableness on this. It's measurable, specific criteria is totally expected by the government and by last that we will extend and now our partner Inalum well had to be extended. So we're in a much better position than we were under our [indiscernible] in many respects and this is one of them. Alex Hacking : Okay, thanks Richard, that's very clear. And then once Grasberg is through the transition it's going to be a big cash cow, do you have any kind of guarantees on your ability to get that cash out of Indonesia? Thanks. Richard Adkerson : We do, and one of the things that was again a focus point of negotiations was that within the shareholders agreement is an agreement on financial policy. Dividends will not be set by the Board of Commissioners or Board of Directors. There's an agreement that to the extent that cash is generated from the operation beyond in excess of its capital expenditures and other cash requirements, that's going to be distributed as dividends and there's no restrictions on that. So we have a set financial policy that goes to 2041. The entity can't incur debt without mutual agreement so\u2026 Alex Hacking : Okay, thanks. Again, very clear and then just one final one if I may. On the Cerro Verde royalty dispute, do you anticipate any midterm cash flow impacts from that and does it affect your 2019 cost guidance in anyway? Thanks. Kathleen Quirk : We've got some payments worked into our plan where we are paying some amounts in installments under protest. We're going to continue to pursue legal strategy to get those payments back, but we do have some amounts going through our cash flows over time to pay on those obligations for those claims. Alex Hacking : Okay, thanks Kathleen. Best of luck. Thank you again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Murphy with Barclays. Please go ahead. Matthew Murphy : Hi, I had a question, another one on the Grasberg Block Cave ramp up. I'm just wondering how major this first drop point blast, is this is being followed up with like mocking and this cave is propagating or is it still very early days, so I'm just wondering how you look at the de-risking of the project over the course of the year and what stage do you think you feel more comfortable with kind of with the proof of concept here? Richard Adkerson : Okay, Mark. Mark Johnson : Yes, it's the first step, so it's significant in that the blast went well, good fragmentation. We are not - right now what we do until we hit a hydraulic radius in this area of the Grasberg Block Cave as we continue to do the same thing. We continue to undercut blasts and follow it up with a drawbell blast. We are about 50% of the hydraulic radius and that's the span with which the cave we had expected to start caving on its own. We expect to be at hydraulic radius late second quarter, early third quarter this year and at that point you can start to muck the drop points that you've already blasted while you continue to add new drop points as Richard stated the Grasberg Block Cave is - we've got multiple work areas there it's essentially \u2013 it's mineralization, but the geometry is essentially, we have two mines that we're developing concurrently that share the same infrastructure. We have two fronts right now that we already established with the undercut sequencing on the very southern portion of the ore body. And within this quarter we start to develop the northern limb of the ore body and that will continue on in a similar fashion. We don't see any surprises. Like Richard said, we know this ore body very well. We're not deep. There's the geology and mapping is indicated the same fracture frequency and consistency of the rock that we had initially modeled. So I really don't see any issues there in fact. You know we think that there's potential for upside, we've got a lot of the construction ahead in the Grasberg Block Cave a lot of the drawbells have been constructed and are ready to be blasted. So we've got a good inventory of development ahead of us. The infrastructure is in place. We continue to add ventilation and pumping systems as we need to, but we're in very good shape in the Grasberg Block Cave. Matthew Murphy : Okay, thanks for that. I mean not to get too bogged down on details, but I'm just trying to picture, I mean you've got a big open pit and a lot of rainfall above this area, just wondering at what point do you start seeing some of that water flow and how do you deal with it? Thanks. Richard Adkerson : Yes, we've got extensive drainage within the grasp of blockade development. We end up fortunately for an underground mine our failsafe is that gravity drains out to the rich camp area. We've got the attics that are at a lower elevation. If the pumping systems were to go off the failsafe would be is that the access drifts are built to handle the peak flows that we've modeled. We put a lot of effort into deep watering along the periphery of the Grasberg Block Cave to keep the groundwater away from the cave and that's going well. We've got surface training systems at the Grasberg around the pit that will continue to maintain to minimize the amount of surface water that gets into the cave. We've done a lot of work on this we've looked at a lot of contingencies and we feel very good about the system that we have and essentially the pumping system that we put in is purely to more economically provide the mill with water. If it wasn't for the mill needing water we could essentially let gravity do its thing at the GDC with all the drainage systems that we're putting in as part of the Block Cave development. Matthew Murphy : So Mark, when do we put in the [indiscernible] attic? Mark Johnson : Yes, it was in the 1990, actually this was probably about 1995 because we found the big [indiscernible] with that. Matthew Murphy : So the only point of that is this water management issue is not a new issue associated with the current development. It has been something that's been part of this operation from the very start and what we've done in the past will allow us to deal with these issues that you raised. Mark Johnson : One thing, as big as the pit is right now and if you look at what we're doing, we've been very good at being able to manage the pit bottom. We're only pumping about 2000 gallons a minute from the pit bottom and we have access to this [indiscernible] drift that Richard mentions, we still use that for pit dewatering. So we've been able to get keep the pit dewatered with a very minor amount of pumping infrastructure because we can use the access that we have underground and we'll continue to look at those sort of approaches with the GDC. Matthew Murphy : All right, thanks Mark. Let's move along. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotia Bank. Please go ahead. Orest Wowkodaw : Hi, good morning. I was just wondering if we could get a bit more color on the cost outlook and I appreciate the long term pro-forma cost guidance you\u2019ve given us here of a $1.30 a pound. Does that imply that we should anticipate costs in North America and South America close to the $2.00 a pound range before thinking about Grasberg? Richard Adkerson : No, I think it's a $1.70 range not $2.00. Orest Wowkodaw : That's 70? Richard Adkerson : Yes, $1.75, that's sort of where we are now and that's what our current outlook is unless there's some major changes in the input cost. Orest Wowkodaw : But what drives down from I think you're guiding this here in North America cost of a $1.86, so what, in the future I would think rates declined, what would be driving the long term cost per pound down? Kathleen Quirk : Richard was talking about a blend between North America and South America\u2026 Richard Adkerson : I was talking about the Americas combination. So if you look at South America, North America combined which we look at is kind of one business unit, that's where the combined rate was. Mark Johnson : But in general, the maintenance costs that Richard referred to that we've been incurring catching up those all level of get back in sequence. And we get back to those historical rates Richard Adkerson : This is not - the nature of these ore bodies, they're low grade, but they don't have significant declines in grade over time. They'll change year-to-year, but it's not a question like a big open pit war free where you mine the high grades first. I mean the highest grades remind you of 100 years ago. So it's more consistent grades than you might see at other mines, and you would see at other mines. Orest Wowkodaw : Okay, and in terms of the reserve increase, how much, can you give us a rough idea what percent of that increase has to do with the copper price change versus additional drilling? Kathleen Quirk : A big portion of it is related to the copper price change. We did do some drilling at Lone Star and actually have done more drilling that isn't reflected yet in 2018 reserves that will be incorporated into the mines in 2019, but most of that is really dealing with the price assumptions and what we'll do is look at how to develop those reserves over time at the lowest possible cost. And really just expanded the footprint brought in pounds that would meet the reserve criteria 250 or less. Richard Adkerson : Yes, so what we do is, we look at our current operations that we've got planned and we're just removing this artificial constraint on the footprint of the cone of the reserves that we previously limited to $2 and now it's extended to show what would be economic in $2.50. Kathleen Quirk : And we'll be likely mining in our $2 reserve plan for a long time. So we try to keep mining in a plan that keeps the cash cost as low as possible. But this gives us more optionality to look at expansions or bringing metal forward over time. Orest Wowkodaw : Great, thank you very much. Richard Adkerson : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead. John Tumazos : Thank you. Your reserving mineralized materials very interesting with the Americas Reserve going up 23.7 and the mineralized material gone up 42 billion pounds. In addition to that 66 billion pounds is like two times Grasberg, but smaller than Escondida. Could you give us a little more explanation how much of the mineralized material was new drilling at El Abra and new drilling at Lone Star versus the $3.00 resource price was that the same $3 price as a year ago?. Maybe it will be good if you just posted the reserve and resource pages of your 10-K on your website today, it might be more interesting than the rest of it. [Indiscernible] it deserves more than some antiseptic legal summary that your SEC attorneys write. Richard Adkerson : Right, but John with the exception of Lone Star it's mostly price change, there's not a lot of new drilling that that drives that change. Red Conger : But having said that John, over the past 12 years we've done an enormous amount of drilling. I mean previously when we walked in here Phelps Dodge and not, I mean had really management decision had limited drilling. They just hadn't done it, so we came in, we drilled out El Abra and added significantly drilled Lone Star, we did drill more at Morenci, Bagdad. So it is not just what happened this past year, but the cumulative effect and then by releasing this artificial constraint at $2.00 we were able to take into account, previous drilling results and expand the cones of these reserves to some that was more realistic to $2.50. But we're going to continue to drill and understand what the resources are and that will go into our ranking of future investment opportunities. John Tumazos : Did the higher copper price for mid molly resources to come into reserves from the properties that are copper with a molly credit is that how the molly went up a 1 billion pounds? Mark Johnson : Yes, exactly because of expanding the cones for Bagdad, Sierrita, Cerro Verde, all of those byproduct molly operations, it took into material that was once outside the reserves and now it is in reserves. John Tumazos : I just hope you explain the 66 new billion balance, wonderful. Richard Adkerson : Yes, that's what we're going to be focused on now John. John Tumazos : Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead. Chris Mancini : Hi, thanks. Just a quick question on the North American operations, are you experiencing any labor inflation due to the low unemployment rate just generally in the U.S. and are you having any trouble say finding skilled workers to drive the trucks and things like that and does that kind of play into your analysis relative to building these big new projects? We've been hearing just broadly speaking even trucks you know difficulty finding long haul truck drivers in the U.S. and things like that just wondering what are you guys experiencing from that perspective? Richard Adkerson : Yes, Chris. In North America we brought out 2500 new employees last year in a very tight market. Truck drivers, equipment operators we've been very successful with. We're still a bit short on skilled craft, people, mechanics, electricians, those kinds of things were in type demand. We're very pleased with how our team has approached that and attracted great new employees to come work with us for the future and we don't see that as a deterrent to spending going forward. Mark Johnson : Having said that we're working with states and local communities, and craft training and trying to encourage people. We've invested a lot in facilities for our employees, particularly at Morenci it's a challenge to get people to live in these remote rural communities and we're working with universities. We're looking beyond just truck drivers, but we're working with universities now to define future leaders in engineering, metallurgy, geology and technical skills. So it's a real problem. It's coming problem and we've given it a lot of thought, investment and community activity work to try to deal with it. Chris Mancini : Okay, yes that\u2019s great. I mean guess you been in Arizona for such a long time and it's that you're in an advantageous position I guess relative to some others? Thanks a lot. Richard Adkerson : All right. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Michael Dudas : Thanks for getting me in and I hesitate to bring up a football analogy given what happened on Sunday. Richard Adkerson : We're going to have a moment of silence at the end of this. Terrible. Michael Dudas : Yes, good luck with the lawsuits. I would characterize since the 2006 to 2018 timeframe, you've had to play a lot of defense, especially with the balance sheet and such but prices being low and maybe any negotiations with Indonesian to resolve the issues are you set up to be play more offense here and is your balance sheet structure do you think to do that given what you've done and in that context if you were to see much lower copper prices are plans in 2019 and 2020 pretty much set in stone and conversely if price were to spike and get more generation of cash flow is that poised towards balance sheet, is that towards CapEx or other issues? Richard Adkerson : Okay, so you're exactly right. I mean, I really liked the analysis of switching from defense to offense, Tsunami. Three years ago the defense was survival with $20 billion of debt and not a clear cut path as to how we're going to get out of it. But we took some bitter pills, we sold assets, raised some capital, got that dealt with. Then we had the struggle with Indonesian, and three years ago we were at the point of filing an arbitration claim. And I stood in a press release in Jakarta and you know basically drew a line in the sand and now we work cooperatively to where you know the last press conference I had in Indonesia we were shaking hands and smiling and everybody was pleased to report we ended up with, so you're exactly right now. If you look at our debt repayment schedule, we don't have any near term debt requirements, and so as we look at the next two years if we do have to face a severe downturn in commodity prices, we can weather that, we can weather that without having to alter our long term mine plans. We will tighten again where we have to tighten and we'll respond to it, but it's not the critical situation we were in three years ago and so we can manage through that. If prices get higher during that period of time in that timeframe we're not likely to change our capital spending and to the extent we generate if they do allow us to generate excess cash, we'll use that for the reduce debt for the time being and that will accelerate our plans for future spending. Michael Dudas : Thank you, Richard. Richard Adkerson : All right. I appreciate it. Operator : Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to management for any closing remarks. Richard Adkerson : All I'm saying is, I'm not watching the Super Bowl. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks everyone. We\u2019re available for any follow ups. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call includes forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings. On the call today are Richard Adkerson, our Chief Executive Officer; Red Conger is here; Mark Johnson is on the line; and Mike Kendrick is also here. I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results, and then we'll turn the call over to Richard, who will be reviewing our recent performance and outlook using the prepared slide presentation materials that are on our website. As usual, after our prepared remarks, we'll open up the call for questions. Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $31 million, or $0.02 a share in the first quarter of 2019. After adjusting for net charges of $36 million, or $0.03 a share which are detailed on page -- roman numeral VI of the press release, adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $67 million or $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2019. Our adjusted earnings before interest taxes and depreciation for the first quarter totaled $778 million. A reconciliation of our adjusted EBITDA calculation is available on page 28 of our slide deck. Our sales for the first quarter totaled 784 million pounds of copper, 242,000 ounces of gold and 22 million pounds of molybdenum. As expected our sales volumes were lower than the year ago quarter associated -- primarily associated with the transition at the Grasberg mine in Indonesia. Our copper and gold sales were approximately 5% lower than the January 2019 sales estimates of 825 million pounds and 255,000 ounces of gold. This reflects the weather impacts at the events that we had at El Abra during the quarter, which normal operations have now been restored, unscheduled maintenance at one of our North American sites and the timing of some shipments from Indonesia. Our quarterly average realized price for the first quarter was $2.90 per pound. That was slightly below last year's first quarter average price of $3.11 per pound. And our gold realized price of $1291 per ounce was slightly below last year's first quarter of $1312 per ounce. Our consolidated average net unit cash cost net of byproduct credits was $1.78 per pound in the first quarter of 2019. As anticipated the unit net cash costs were higher than the first quarter of 2018 average of $0.98 per pound and that primarily reflected the lower sales volume from Indonesia. We generated operating cash flows of $534 million in the first quarter and we funded capital expenditures including capital expenditures associated with our underground development and with the Lone Star development totaling $622 million. During March, we redeemed all of our outstanding notes due 2020. That was $1 billion in debt redemption during March. We ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in consolidated cash and $9.9 billion in consolidated debt. We had no borrowings and $3.5 billion available under our revolving credit facility. I'll now turn the call over to the Richard, who will be referring to our slide presentation materials. Richard Adkerson : Good morning, everyone. The first quarter for Freeport was really straightforward. We are pleased to report that we are on track with our plans that we discussed at our last earnings call and across the board our business is going in a normal fashion. As a result, we haven't made any significant changes to our operational outlook and our important initiatives that we have that we're working on these two years of transition at Grasberg are proceeding as scheduled and as planned. This is the first quarter of those two years. And as we look forward to the ramping up Grasberg to sustainable levels, it's going to be a good time for our company. A note, we just published our new annual report and it showcases our assets the strength and quality of our geographically diverse portfolio of mining assets and the inherent fundamental values that these assets provide. Going forward and looking forward we have a very clear strategy that we are confident will grow value for shareholders. The important accomplishment we achieved in recent years to strengthen our balance sheet to reach a resolution of our longstanding issues on our contract in Indonesia and providing some clear-cut long-range opportunity to operate in a stable fashion really position us to deliver on this commitment to build values for our shareholders. Our 2019 priorities as part of the strategy is listed on page 4 of the slide deck. Here at the company we are laser focused on executing these priorities during 2019 and are diverting any plans for major new capital investments or looking at M&A activity because we are confident that success -- if we are successful and we believe we will be in achieving these priorities that that's what's going to drive the future values of our company. In Indonesia, the ramp-up of the underground mines are going well proceeding on schedule. I'll cover other milestones later in the presentation. In the Americas, we're really focused now on productivity cost control and discipline across all of our operations. We're pleased with the success that Red Conger and his team are achieving. In that regard our Lone Star project is on schedule and it's going -- it's not a huge capital investment but it's a profitable one. And we continue really to be encouraged by exploratory drilling and analysis results for this asset, which we believe has the outlook of growing to a world-class resource. We continue to study, evaluate and rank potential future growth projects to establish long-term value opportunities for our company. But as I said, for the next couple years, we're in the study mode as opposed to the committing capital mode. The success on all these objectives combined with what we expect to be a positive future copper market environment, and that's a consensus across the industry will provide values for our shareholders. Turning to page 3, we list out the attributes of our company that have been consistent : leading copper producer, responsible operator, great set of long-lived assets that can be operated in an attractive cost, structure, the portfolio. It\u2019s difficult to -- it would be difficult for anyone to replicate. We've got significant current production volumes, which we can continue by managing our existing sets of assets. I mentioned our potential future growth options. And we've got a proven track record for superior execution. Since acquiring Phelps Dodge 12 years ago, we've had success. We've managed major expansions of our assets. When the time was right, the expansion at Cerro Verde improves a prime example of that. But we also, in two phases built great mine in the Congo with Tenke Fungurume. We expanded Morenci. We expanded our Climax mine. And we've shown what we can do in terms of execution and building assets, and in operating assets. And we have a benefit for our company that's really a significant one. We operate all the mines that we have interest in. And that allows us to share expertise to find things that work in one place, and spread it across the company, and to be able to allocate resources people equipment, supply chain issues on a company-wide basis. With the steps, we've taken over the past three years, we are now financially strong. We'll get stronger. We are positive about the outlook of the copper business, and seen nothing in recent developments to change that view. And we have a clear strategy of building values for the shareholders. I previously referenced a slide on page four that talks about what we're going to be doing this year, and looking into next year. Focused on the transition at Grasberg in the Americas, productivity cost controls, and also in Eastern Arizona advancing the Lone Star project, and assessing long-term opportunities. And so, we're confident about what we're doing. Looking at an operations update in North America, we are making progress in this productivity cost control management. We're using advanced analytics. We started a project at our Bagdad mine as in effect a text case. It's been very successful in terms of using -- it's doing things that we always knew how to do, and we had a team to do it. What we're doing now is using data capabilities to measure things, and respond to them very quickly. You hear a lot about this across all industries. So this is not anything that's different, but applying it in a business like ours is not something that people intuitively think about. We brought in McKinsey and other outside experts to work with us. We're really encouraged by what's happening in Bagdad now. The next stop is going to be Morenci. But across the board, we're going to be using this big data analytics to help make our business better, reduce our costs, improve productivity. In Cerro -- in South America, the Cerro Verde mine continues just to excel. It's exceptional. The mill, which was originally designed to add to our 120,000 tons per day existing facility, 240,000 tons today is operating well over name play continues to have opportunities to further improve. And so, that has us focused on de-bottlenecking the rest of the business to take advantage of these processing facilities that we have. Our volumes were off in the first quarter in the Americas. The principal reason for that was at El Abra, the driest place in the world. I mean Atacama Desert this is at altitude moisture just doesn't get across the Andes to this part of the world. But in the second quarter, in a week's time -- in the first quarter, in a week's time, we had 10 years' worth of rain at this site. 10 years' worth of rain. It was a major flood event. We were out 35 days. The team responded very well to restore our operations. And now we're -- by mid-March, we're up and running again in a normal fashion. We also helped the people in the local community. It was an extraordinary event that had a big impact. We also had a sales impact, because we were pushing a turnaround at our Miami smelter in Arizona. It's part of our productivity where we're trying to extend the time before we started the turnaround. I think Red, it was 10 days or 15 days before we were going to shut down anyway. We had an event in the furnace, and that knocked that smelter out for a period of time in the first quarter. So you see there's a difference between our production numbers and our sales numbers, and that was because of the cut-off to the marketplace we had because of this event at the smelter. It's up and running again. All those volumes are going to be going through. It shows up in our unit cost numbers, because we had lower volumes, lower sales volumes. And so, otherwise our costs were pretty much in line with what we were looking for. In Indonesia, Grasberg, we're competing the final phases of the Grasberg open pit. Our plans call for that to happened midyear this year. We may have an opportunity to extend that. It's very high-grade material, but it's an issue of where we're focused on the long term. We're going to do this safely. And the underground ramp-up is proceeding as planned. So this is what's going on with us. On slide 6, we have these efficiency measures that we're taking through using data innovation. I mentioned the Bagdad team that we formed across our board using our metallurgists, our operators the process control team. We've got big data experts from our organization and from the outside. We're using this information technology to do very basic things about running the mill, making sure that we have, the right grind for the right ore dispatching in our mine operations. Just bringing all the basics together, with using information technology to make us a lot better, and we're really encouraged by the initial results at Bagdad. We have a 12% increase in mill throughput. We've increased recoveries. All this doing without much capital being put into it. So it's very profitable. As I said, we're now taking it to Morenci, and we'll be using our information that we have across the board. And if we are able to achieve, which we think we will be a 10% increase through productivity measures, that's equivalent to adding 20 million pounds of copper a year annually with virtually no capital. So we want to continue to use technology to standardize our systems and processes, and to help us achieve this kind of meaningful addition to our volume. Lone Star is really taking shape. Those of you, who follow us, know this is a long known resource. It's adjacent to our Safford mine, which was just being -- beginning production 12 years ago. It's original oxide deposit. Resources are being depleted. This is right across the mountain ridge from Morenci. And so we are now in the phase of mining a leach oxide deposit, that we will be able to process at our excess facilities at the adjacent Safford mine as that mine wraps down. So this allows us to profit from this oxide cover over a major sulfide resource that we're working to understand. And it's an $850 million project that we spent, just under $400 million of that by the end of the quarter. It's got very favorable economics. And will give us 200 million pounds a year of copper, with expansion opportunities for the oxide. So, we're doing that. But the really exciting thing long-run is this is serving as a stripping exercise over what we are seeing as a major sulfide resource. And we've shown some drill holes reserves that we're seeing. And we're beginning long-term plans about how we would develop that resource. It would be a major mill investment. But, literally as we look at this it has the potential of being another Morenci which is the flagship mine of our operations -- or the industry's operations in North America. We're really excited about it. I mentioned that Cerro Verde with this outperformance by the mill that we're having. You can see with the 360,000 tons nameplate, we're operating well above that. Indications are we can continue to do that. And so that means we're processing 15% more ore than originally designed. And now we're looking about how to feed the mill, how to make the movement from the mine to mill more efficient, but also how to attack the mine in a way to get more ore to it. So, we began this process just three years ago early 2016 after a $4.5 billion $5 billion expansion project that was completed at the end of 2015 going into 2016. So we're three years into it. It's improving debottlenecking. It's a great asset. And we're real proud of it. So, PT-FI underground transition. How long we've been looking for this. It was something for me. My first trip to the job site was -- in Papua was in the first quarter of 1988 when we were just drilling the original drill holes. Now we're seeing that pit being completed major activity there. And now, going forward, just by the end of the year we'll be totally underground with the Grasberg Block Cave which is the same ore body extending beneath the open pit. It's got about $1 billion tons of reserves at 1% copper and 0.72 grams per ton gold on average. As we've been working in recent years on all these matters we've been working with an Indonesia and going through all the issues there Mark Johnson and his team have really done a great job in investing in the infrastructure to get us in place to kick this mine off as we're doing right now. So we are -- we're making great progress in the first quarter. We've been focused at the Grasberg Block Cave on expanding the cave and opening drawbells. We had 11 drawbells opened by the end of the first quarter. One was blasted in December and 10 in the quarter. We're five drawbells ahead of schedule. Undercutting of the new face in that mine is proceeding, this is really two mines in 1, three faces going on in those two mines and this is ore that we've been mining now for 30 years. So it's the same ore. We know the chemistry of it. We don't expect any issues associated with processing and so forth. The adjacent mine, which is a separate mineralization feature altogether is the Deep MLZ mine. This is the latest deepest extension of mining in a Block Cave underground at Freeport began in the early 1980s. And after our work in the first quarter we're on target for development against a forecast to get this mine up to stream. It's been delayed because we encountered seismic events. In response to that, we -- our team which is very experienced and we brought a team of global experts into play have designed a program of using hydraulic fracking which has been used in South America, but not in our operations previously to precondition this harder than expected rock, so that we can promulgate caving in a normal fashion. To date, we've hydro fracked, 14 holes nine from the DOZ truck level and five from the undercut level. The seismic response to this has been positive. And so we are very encouraged about it. It's working so well that we are likely to build this into an ongoing feature in mining the Deep MLZ mine. Now, we are really taking this mine in two faces. There's a production block 2 which we are opening up the cave area to the west of the current cave. This provides a second separate working face. It will grow the hydraulic radius faster. And we'll be in better shape. And by doing this we're now on track of meeting our targets for ramping up this to meet our original targets. So, all of this is going well. We've got the really significant reserves there of these two mines. And we're on track to continue to achieve what we've set out to achieve and meet our plan. On page 10 -- slide 10, we have the ramp-up of the underground. You can see the impact of completing mining in the open pit in 2019. Mark and his guys are looking at perhaps getting a bit more out of the pit, but as I said, our focus is going to be how can we, get back up to sustainable levels on our timeframe. So after two years of ore volumes we will begin ramping up. And you can see how that works with the Grasberg Block Cave beginning this year and then basically doubling every year up to 130,000 tons a day. And that will be our primary asset going beyond 2023. The Deep MLZ mine is also ramping up going from 27,000 tons per day in the mine in 2020 to almost 60,000, 80,000 and long-term 80,000. So, we're on track to get these sustainable volumes coming out of these mines, feeding our mill at over 200,000 tons per day which is a major accomplishment in terms of having large-scale underground mining. And we're on track to get it done. There's a lot of talk about copper markets. As usual we were down in CESCO, talked with everybody down there. So, we have seen nothing to change our fundamental view about, the positive outlook from a fundamental standpoint. When you look at the long-term reduced percentage growth in China, but the sheer amount of copper that would be required for that economy with the mature markets our current business in the United States has been strong. Over the past couple of years we supply about one-third of the downstream copper to the U.S. market from our mines in the U.S. and it's really, really tight. But longer-range, you're looking at what's the emerging markets are going to require. You certainly see that in Indonesia. I mean, I spent a lot of time in Jakarta and just watching the cranes and seeing the growth in that economy and that's true all across Southeast Asia into Latin America and ultimately Eastern Europe and Africa. So it's a -- we feel very confident about the fundamentals of copper it's qualities and its need for the world's economy. Things that will add to it over time in terms of the growing electrification of the world, the use of alternative energy, electronics and everything we do electric vehicles and so forth, we feel very good about the demand for copper and the project pipeline remains thin. And we know as an experienced operator what it takes to develop new projects. And we also know that others in the industry are going to share our disciplined approach to what we do going forward. So we believe that a significant long-term structural deficit remains in place and that our assets and their ability to address this deficit we're going to create great values for our shareholder. For the year, we are looking at producing 3.3 billion pounds of copper 800 million ounces of gold, just under 800 million ounces of gold -- 800,000 ounces of gold and just under 100 million pounds of molybdenum. Site production costs are going to be higher than the long-term sustainable amounts because of lower volumes with the Grasberg transition. And our operating cash costs depending on the price of copper will come close to funding our CapEx over these two years. And our current dividend may fall a bit short again depending on the price of copper. But the company is financially strong and certainly has the financial flexibility to deal with that. And then coming are details for our production coming out of the two years and seeing the significant increase in copper and gold sales as we ramp up the Grasberg Block Cave and the Deep MLZ will provide substantial cash flows and that's shown on slide 14 where we have -- where we show the cash flows for the transition year of 2020 and averages for the next two years. You can see at $3 copper, it goes from just over $4 billion to $7.5 billion and if copper prices are higher that delta gets much higher. So we're set up to have a situation of really benefiting from the ramp-up in underground and Grasberg having potentially good copper markets. We're focused on keeping a strong balance sheet. We should have opportunities to further reduce our debt in the future. We're going to be disciplined about investments. For the time being, we'll maintain our current dividend. The board is looking forward to days in the future when we can increase it and believe that we're real well positioned. It's been a good quarter and we're going to be continued focused on execution. So with that, we will open the line up for your questions and look forward to hearing them. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Piyush Sood with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Piyush Sood : Hey guys, good morning. A couple of questions. First one, the 2021 outlook on costs of $1.30, what are you assuming for export duties out of Indonesia? Do you see them falling versus the 5% level right now? Or are you holding them at 5%? A \u2013 Kathleen Quirk : Once we get to a certain level of construction progress on the smelter they fall to zero. And so we're expecting during that period of time that our export duties will fall away in Indonesia. Q \u2013 Piyush Sood : So that would mean that you probably hit the threshold which take these export duties down to zero. So maybe the construction on the smelter -- or at least the progress on the smelter has to start happening soon to meet that timeline? A \u2013 Richard Adkerson : It's already started. We had a commitment to build the smelter with our December agreements. And with that agreement we're full. As I said I think at a conference we're full-throttle on the smelter development. We've got a site, we're working with engineers. We've met the initial targets that the government had set. So we are in progress with it right now. We didn't start it in earnest until we got the agreement with the government in December. So we had done some initial prep work, but now we're full-throttling into it. Q \u2013 Piyush Sood : We read that PT Amman the owners of Batu Hijau will likely go ahead with their own smelter, so they might be less inclined to partner with the PTFI. Is that something you would comment on? And if that's true, would you be open to other international partners? A \u2013 Richard Adkerson : The answer is yes to both of those questions. We have a great relationship with Amman people. We've known them for a long time. We had discussions about doing something together and we still may. At the present time, they've concluded, they need to do something at Sumbawa. We looked at that decided it didn't work for us. So we're focused on East Resik and continue to talk with them about whether they might join us there. At the present time that's not the plan. And yes, we are talking with potential other international investors who might have an interest in the offtake. Q \u2013 Piyush Sood : And last one for me. The reduction in gold guidance in 2021, do you think that's largely just a rounding of the total? Or is that because of some changes to mine planning? A \u2013 Kathleen Quirk : No that's actually just a rounding change. We had just a slight -- real slight change in gold output which rounded from 1.6 million ounces to 1.5 million ounces. So wasn't a -- and the same thing with the capital expenditures for this year. It was less than a $50 million change, but just because of the rounding it rounded up. Q \u2013 Piyush Sood : All right. Thanks for the color and all the best. A \u2013 Richard Adkerson : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Matthew Korn : Hey good morning Richard. Good morning Kathleen. A \u2013 Richard Adkerson : Good morning. Q \u2013 Matthew Korn : It's Matthew Korn here. So you've given us a walk to your cost expectations for 2021. What kind of indications can you give us around 2020? Because I'm looking at your slide 14 in which you lay out the EBITDA levels indicated and I see that what you now expect for 2020 copper at $3, looks a lot like what the average last quarter for 2019 and 2020 looked like. So how can we think about -- the volumes aren't going to increase that much in terms of Grasberg, but if there -- should we see any substantial cost improvement that will actually flow through? A \u2013 Kathleen Quirk : We do expect to see lower unit costs in 2019 -- I mean 2020 versus 2019 stepping down somewhat not getting to $1.30 like we talked about for 2021, but it will step down some during 2020. Q \u2013 Matthew Korn : All right. And then I... A \u2013 Richard Adkerson : And I'll just say with having the new structural deal, with having this progress we're making on the underground advancement, Mark has been working with us and his team is really going to be focused on cost efficiencies at Grasberg and we think there's some opportunities there. We know there are opportunities there and we're going to find them. Matthew Korn : Well looking out at the PT-FI plan and looking out at the expected production levels at Grasberg, it's always good to see that kind of stability. I did see some slight changes in the underground ramp for 2020. Looks like there's a little bit of decline in throughput and per ton -- or ton per day throughput, but it doesn't look like that's actually DMLZ it's looks like it's actually more DOZ and Big Gossan. Is there anything in particular driving that slight reduction in ore milled? Richard Adkerson : Well, we do have a program of updating all of our outlooks every quarter and so you're going to see quarter-by-quarter. So, what we try to avoid is having any kind of big annual review and not reporting things there. So, as DOZ is a very mature mine and the Big Gossan is -- it's not a Block Cave mine. You're going to see some adjustments to their DOZ throughout its life. It's had issues with wet muck and we really kind of led the industry in developing remote-control mining in response to that. They've had some issues like that. So, these are -- Matt these are just normal adjustments that are typical for operations review. There's nothing fundamentally that's changed right. Mark Johnson is in Indonesia and is on the call. Mark do you have anything to add to that? Mark Johnson : Yes, Big Gossan was unchanged. We're still targeting ramping it up to 7,000 tons per day which is the nameplate. We'll get to that in the third quarter of this year. DOZ we had a slight reduction in what we saw. Based on our -- some of our recent experience on ramping up the automation systems, we had a peak of 43,000 tons a day that we've reduced to 37,000. We've had some real breakthroughs there. We're continuing to be optimistic on how we're applying the technology into DOZ. But we're being just a little bit more cautious on the out years. Matthew Korn : All right, fair enough. That's very helpful. Appreciate. I'll pass along guys. Richard Adkerson : All right. Thanks Matt. Operator : The next question is from Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Curt Woodworth : Hey good morning Richard, Kathleen. Richard Adkerson : Good morning. Kathleen Quirk : Good morning. Curt Woodworth : First question is just with regard to I guess the hydraulic fracking at Deep MLZ. You talked about adding a third unit there. Can you just talk about what the I guess the milestones you expect to achieve there over the next several quarters? And then you mentioned starting to produce in Block two over the second mine area which extends the radius. So, I mean is that is effectively that giving you more cushion in terms of hitting your production targets? Or if you could just elaborate on kind of exactly how that provides confidence to the target? Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Well, it's those steps that allow us to meet this plan. So, it's -- what we've done is we began this process and are now seeing good positive results for it and we're continuing. We had one issue that had some maintenance problems with it and so we bought a new unit to bring it onstream. And so all of this is what goes in to enable us to meet the plan. And the report today is that as we stand here it's working as we had hoped. Now for us to achieve the plan we have to continue having that progress day-by-day and we're very encouraged about it. So, there's not anything that I would describe as cushion but it's what's gone in to enable us to present this plan and that's our expectation. We have confidence but we recognize we're in a show-me time so we've got to we show ourselves show the world that we can achieve this plan. The really good news is we've had a good first quarter starting this year off in doing just that. I don't know if that answers your question or if anything is in specific Mark can address but-- Curt Woodworth : No. Yes, that's helpful. And then just second question on I guess how you think about sort of your resource base and portfolio where there's a lot of strategic interest and relatively high private-party valuation multiples that's being paid for assets. Is there any potential that you see for monetization of assets or reserves or JV arrangements that could accelerate the deleveraging targets you have? Richard Adkerson : Well we're very comfortable with really where our balance sheet is today. You look at what's happened with our bond trading and our relationships with our banks and so forth. So we don't feel any pressure to further reduce our debt. We will if copper prices stay reasonably strong if they strengthen as some expect we'll have cash available to further reduce our debt and we'll do that. But that's just a use of cash as opposed to feeling any pressure to do it. We like these resources for our own company's opportunities to create value. We have a partner at our El Abra mine. Codelco is a 49% partner at El Abra in Chile. We own 100% of a number of our properties here in the U.S. One of the great things about our company is we don't face income taxes on production in the U.S. for a very, very long time. The combination of a tax loss carryforward from an oil and gas deal and the new U.S. tax regime. And so that when you think about having development opportunities with zero tax and you look internationally and you've got significant taxes wherever you look that's a real opportunity for us. So, I -- from time-to-time, we approached people about who want to do something if it makes sense for us we'll do it. But so far we haven't reached that conclusion. We'll have an open mind but there's no pressure to do anything. We're very comfortable with our balance sheet. Curt Woodworth : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Chris Terry : Hi Richard and Kathleen. A couple of questions from me. Just firstly on the second quarter numbers that you've guided towards. Those are down a little bit I guess on the update for the 4Q 2018. Can you just talk through some of the moving parts on that and the slight pushout to the second half of the year? I think it's around El Abra, Grasberg et, cetera. Is it around the export delays on Grasberg? Just a little bit more color on the second quarter. thanks. Kathleen Quirk : We've got -- Chris this is Kathleen. We've got some -- just in our shipping schedule, we've got some concentrate inventory build at Grasberg planned during the second quarter. Potentially, those could move into the second quarter from the third quarter. But at this point in time, our shipping schedule shows that we've got some concentrate build during the quarter. So, it's really more of a shipment timing as opposed to anything else. Chris Terry : Okay. Thanks Kathleen. And then just in terms of the comment on the export permit trying to increase the amount there. Is that -- that would only impact things say early next year or in that order, right? It's not a cap on an amount that you can ship per month or anything. It's a total amount for the year right? So, can you just give some color? Kathleen Quirk : It's a total amount per year, but it was set based on our plan that we submitted to the government last fall, last October/November timeframe. And we're actually -- it shows a quota that's much lower than it has been historically, because we're in this transition. And we actually believe that we're going to produce more than that quota this year. So, we'll be going in to get a revision. That's partially why our shipping schedule is planned the way it is to give us time to get that revision. It's not a big revision we're looking for in these numbers, but we do want to try to build some flexibility in there because as Richard mentioned, Mark and the team are looking at some trade-off studies as to whether we can get more out of the open pit this year. And so that's something that we'll be looking -- evaluating kind of week by week. So we do have some upside to the numbers we believe, but we'll need to get a revision to our export quota. And it's annual thing, but it was based on a plan submitted last year and now we have some opportunities to increase it. Richard Adkerson : And as a practical matter, we kind of wanted to see how this analysis goes about what we might be able to achieve. And the presidential election was just held in Indonesia and we didn't want to make any new filings until after that. So that's one of the -- part of the reasons of why we haven't acted yet to adjust the plan for the very positive news that we're having about having increased production. Chris Terry : Okay. Thanks for that. And then the last one from me. You spoke about the smelter, I think in one of the earlier questions. But what should we expect in terms of any announcements on that in terms of financing or key developments for the Indonesia smelter? Thanks. Kathleen Quirk : Right now, we are doing the engineering, the front-end engineering work. We've contracted with a third-party to do that study for us. We're doing some ground improvement work at the site. And we are evaluating potential partner and financing plans for the smelter. We don't have a significant amount of capital to invest this year. It starts to increase next year. So we'd like to be able to have some sort of financing plan in place by the end of this year, but those discussions are ongoing. Chris Terry : Right. Thanks. Thanks, Kathleen and thanks, Richard. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, Chris. Operator : The next question comes from David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. David Gagliano : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to focus in on the North American operation. They've obviously -- these assets have been around for quite a while. Typically, they're very predictable. This quarter volumes came in low, cost came in high in slag. I think the smelter issue in Miami I think. And then unscheduled maintenance maybe that's the smelter issue. You also mentioned implementing productivity targets efficiency measures and when I look at the full year targets they implied about a 10% rebound during the next three quarters in volume. So a long-winded question or a long-winded intro to my question which is can you just expand a bit on what the main issues are in North America? Are we running into more challenging or can you describe reconciliations cropping up, that kind of thing. Thanks. Richard Adkerson : Yeah. Not of the latter, Dave. I mean, you look at the production number versus the sales number points to the smelter issue and it was really -- it was an unexpected event but it occurred right before we were going to have a shutdown -- a turnaround shutdown in any event. But we were down and so we just were producing things as expected, but we couldn't sell it because of this issue at the smelter. As you know these smelters are complicated assets and around the world you're seeing things like this. So this was not -- nothing to do, the ore -- the grades are there. We're improving in operations. We had 10, 15, 16 we had really scaled back maintenance capital as we talked about in earlier calls, really stretched our team. We've rebuilt that now. We've added to volumes in North America, South America's really going very well. So the thing you saw was that we did have a -- and it didn't have a major effect, but we had some maintenance issues that we had at our Chino mine in New Mexico which is -- it is an older mine. You go back five years ago, we didn't think Chino would be around. Now we've done some drilling and we may have a major expansion project there in our future, but our concentrator there was down 15 days. You'll have these things all along. You see in mines, but fundamentally our Americas operations are -- grades, the models are holding up. The team's getting better more efficient. And that shows up in our production numbers and the sales thing was a one-off deal because of the smelter issue. Kathleen Quirk : Dave ... Richard Adkerson : It was down 40 days by the way so. Kathleen Quirk : We'll say just going back not just this quarter, but going back several quarters in North America you do see a trend of costs going up. And that really reflects the mining rate increases that we've done back in 2015 and 2016. We took mining rates way down to try to maximize cash flow during a tough time in the copper market. We've been ramping back up. Our mining rates and milling rates and that's had some impact on costs. As we look forward, we're really focused on bringing in efficiencies and containing cost and using technologies to arrest any increase in inflationary pressures, et cetera. So, we're really focused on this cost management, particularly in North America. We did have some diesel price increases and that's reflected in our updated guidance. The diesel price was up 10% 12% from our plan number. So we factor that into our new guidance and we factored in some of these issues which Richard was talking about in maintenance that we experienced in the first quarter. But this cost thing in productivity is really what we see being able to drive value in the U.S. because the more we can contain costs there the larger the resources. And that's why we're investing in these technologies to have lower cost better productivity and ultimately more value. David Gagliano : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much. Just switching gears back to Indo and the smelter. The CapEx guidance, I think we've talked about this in the past. The CapEx guide 2019/2020s exclusive of funding for the smelter and given where we are now, can you just comment a bit on what you think CapEx will be in 2019/2020 for the smelter Freeport portion of the total funding? Kathleen Quirk : Yeah. Well, just the 2019 ... Richard Adkerson : One thing I want to make sure when we say Freeport, we're talking about the smelter being funded by PT-FI. Our current plan and you could conceive of a joint venture scenario, but we don't anticipate equity capital requirements out of FCX for the smelter. It'll be spread over a number of years as a PT-FI investment and we're a shareholder in PT-FI as is INALUM and so that's where the funding for this will go. If it's totally debt financed, as is likely to be the case that would result in incremental consolidated debt out of -- for FCX. But the cash requirements all would come out of PT-FI and it's all folded in to our December agreement with the government. So go ahead Kathleen. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. I was going to say, the spend for this year and it's -- again, it's really ground improvement and continuing with the front-end engineering is less than $100 million. And as we get into 2020 and we don't have a specific number until the feed work is done, the front engineering is done. But we're estimating somewhere in the $500 million range next year. And as Richard said, we expect this to be funded out of PT-FI or with partners. And so, PT-FI would have a separate financing arrangement or a new project company would have a separate financing arrangement. So, as Richard said, we don't expect it to come from FCX. David Gagliano : Got it. Understood. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much. Richard Adkerson : Thanks, David. Operator : The next question is from Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Orest Wowkodaw : Hi. Good morning. Follow-up on Grasberg, it's just -- when I look at your mine plan here over the next couple of years, the part that really jumps out at me is that massive step up in 2021, where effectively you're calling for a 300,000-ton year-over-year increase in copper production. Just curious, how realistic you think that is and whether that kind of tonnage has ever been produced in the market from a year-over-year basis on -- from any kind of block cave. It just seems overly aggressive to me and trying to figure out what I'm -- I guess what makes you so comfortable with that and then maybe we can go from there. Richard Adkerson : So it is totally realistic. I mean, we -- quite frankly we wouldn't present it in our plans. We have had experience with operating large block scale mines, as we've been doing managing pits since the early 1980s. And this is not just a single mine. The Grasberg Block Cave is going to have three phases to it. We've modeled all this with exactly what we have shown we could do with our DOZ mine, which was really the third phase of the development of the ore body that the Deep MLZ mine is the fourth phase. And that began in the mid-1990s when we brought in Rio Tinto that replaced the mine called the IOZ which was depleting and so over time we've shown what we could do. It's not a single mine. It's large numbers in the aggregate, but it's things that we've done and we have in fact three phases going forward in the Grasberg Block Cave, which I want to just go back to and say, this is the same ore that we've been mining. It's not deep under the surface like the Deep MLZ mine and this is basically doing what we've done before. The Deep MLZ mine, as I mentioned, has two phases and by having that second phase is going to allow us to meet our original target of getting up to full scale production in 2021. And it's the one where we've had to bring in this fracking and we're satisfied with the progress, but that's the key issue for us is that having this fracking to precondition the rock, to allow it to cave, as we've planned is what we are engaged in now. This has worked in other places. First time for us to do it at Grasberg. So rather than -- I would suggest, rather than thinking about this as having this one massive single mine that may lead you to think it's an aggressive expectation, is to break it apart and say, like, it is five different mines that we're doing. And Mark, do you -- and I'm not going to share to everybody. Mark is not an overly aggressive person when it comes to numbers. So, Mark, why don't you add some comments to what I just said? Mark Johnson : Yes. And I think going back to what you initially started with Richard is, the ramp-up for each of these phases, GBC really is two block caves that share one set of infrastructure. Deep MLZ, as you mentioned, we have two phases that we'll be advancing at the same time. Both of them are based on actual ramp-ups that we experienced in the DOZ, as we ramp it up from 20,000 to 50,000 tons and it's very much driven by the undercutting rate and the amount of draw points that you can develop. And all of these, both the GBC and Deep MLZ, as we ramp them up, are following those empirical or historical experiences that we had. We are getting more efficient at both the undercutting and the draw point development. So we feel that we're well-positioned to ramp them up. The other thing, when you look on the volumes is just, particularly in the Deep MLZ, as we ramp up the tons, the -- we're really in the very sweet spot of the ore body. As we ramp up the tons in 2020 and 2021, copper grades are 1.65 to 1.7. So you're seeing not only an addition of tons, but the grade of those tons are quite high. GBC also is in very good grades as we ramp up in the initial years. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, Mark. Orest Wowkodaw : Thank you for that. And just as a follow-up, more of an accounting question. Your environmental obligations and shutdown costs, there were $42 million this quarter. They seem to be kind of jumping around a fair amount. I'm just wondering if you can give us an idea of what we should anticipate those going forward on an annual basis. Kathleen Quirk : If you look at the press release, Roman numeral VI, it shows that we did have a special item that was recorded in the -- an accrual that was recorded in the first quarter for our legacy costs. If you adjust for that number that -- the balance would be kind of a run rate. But we do have from time to time, this was a legacy item where we had an indemnification from an asset that Phelps Dodge had sold years and years ago and it met the cap. And so we had to accrue for it. But if you back that out, you'll see that on a run rate basis, that's where we'll be, except for these one-off items that we can't forecast. Orest Wowkodaw : Okay. Thanks very much. Richard Adkerson : And this is just like our mine plans. We review all of these legacy liability issues and our reclamation activities every quarter. We have a separate team with outside experts that's involved with that. And so they will, like mine plans, get adjusted as new conditions come into place. I will say that going into the Phelps Dodge deals 12 years ago, that was a huge concern for us. People wanted us to do an unfriendly deal. We decided not to, until we can do some due diligence on it. And over the 12 years, we've managed those costs to be less than in aggregate than what we anticipated. But it's a constant fight and issues come up all the time that we have to deal with. It's a major part of our business. So it's a reasonable question for you to ask. Orest Wowkodaw : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Oscar Cabrera with CIBC. Your line is open. Oscar Cabrera : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Richard in your prepared remarks glad you mentioned that you're going to take a sturdy mode for the next two years and then deploy \u2013 deployed additional capital for your older opportunities. As you're thinking through that where does adding value to shareholders in whether it be a special dividend or buyback how does that play into your thinking now? Richard Adkerson : It's a use of cash. I mean, as we look forward with the strategy of not committing new capital now, if we have a scenario, which many people think reasonable where we have a good copper market two years out from now and we're ramping up production at Grasberg you see just how much our cash flows would increase with success in that ramp up. Even if we decide to sanction a new project after that time, and I say after that time any new project's going to take a number of years to invest in. And so in that scenario, we would have substantial excess cash for our company as we've had in years past. And we would look to further reduce our debt and then make decisions about where to set an appropriate long-term dividend. And if there's additional cash behind that, we have paid special dividends in the past or buy stock back. But it's the use of cash Oscar rather than have a planned strategy going into it. It's going to be based on the circumstances that we face in. Oscar Cabrera : That's clear. Thanks very much. Then you piqued my interest with this additional production out of Grasberg in 2019. And I was under the impression that after the \u2013 you depleted the open pit that would be it. So I was wondering, if you can provide a scope of the increase that you could have in 2019. Does this go forward to 2020? And how do you achieve that? I believe Mark referred to grades in some of the block caves. Richard Adkerson : Okay. So Oscar, don't think of this as open pit being depleted. I mean, depleted is when you have an ore body and you've mined the whole ore body. This is the same ore body that's going down below the limits of the open pit. We worked on this in the mid-90s. The design and optimal shape of the open pit. So as we make this transition the ore is still there in the pit. It's just in the future that ore is going to be mined in the Grasberg Block Cave. And so as we're pulling out of it, we have these geotechnical issues of the shape of the pit how to be safe, how to make sure that as we wind down mining there we're not putting anybody at risk. At the same time, we've already started promulgating the block cave in the Grasberg Block Cave. So this is a bit of a cat and mouse game. If we can get that ore out of the pit, as we're starting up the Grasberg Block Cave that's gravy. I mean, it's very high-grade. We're literally mining the road ramps that come out of that pit. The marketing guys they're going to \u2013 and we always knew this was going to be the case at this time. They're going to see what they can scrape out of that pit of high-grade copper and particularly gold ore. We've given you our best estimate. This would all be done. I don't think Mark there's any thoughts that this was extended beyond 2019, right? We're looking at potential excess in the second half of this year. Isn't that right? Mark Johnson : Yeah. That's true. It's very small scale mining. We're doing 30,000 to 35,000 tons a day in this extension of the pit. As you mentioned, we're taking the ramps that were left in the final pit that were 40 meters wide and we're narrowing those. Those ramps are all in good grade ore, so it's a relatively small scale boutique-type mining that extends the life of the pit. The one thing that we're managing and we have excellent monitoring capabilities is as the cave develops at some point we're going to see some reflection of the cave activity in the high wall of the pit. And that is what will drive us away from this continued ramp removal. If it were not for the block cave underneath, we could do this conceivably into the early part of 2020. Our best estimate is, is that and what we've reflected in the forecast is the ramp removal will end in June. We've got plans that, if the monitoring shows that it's safe to continue we would continue that on a month-by-month basis beyond as long as the monitoring allows us. We don't intend to slow down the block cave development to try to maximize the potential from the pit. The value is truly in the block cave longer-term, that's our focus. The open pit mining is an auxiliary opportunity during the interim. Oscar Cabrera : Okay. Great, Mark. Super helpful. And then the last thing if I may. In one of the notes for your 2019 operating estimates you state here that the 2019 sales assumes Indonesian government approval or increase of PT-FI export quota. Could you provide like a number for that additional scope? I think it was \u2013 you have a permit for 180,000 tons? Kathleen Quirk : Yeah. It's \u2013 what's in our plan is very close to that. So it's -- we've got a little bit more in the plan today. I think it's 40,000 tons of concentrate or something. It's not a huge amount. But we do want to get some flexibility for these things that Mark is referring to so. But just to meet our existing plan it's not a significant number. Oscar Cabrera : Thanks very much, everyone. Good luck. Richard Adkerson : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Your line is open. John Tumazos : Thank you very much. If I could impose with two questions. First, it's very exciting Richard when you say Lone Star could be Morenci. And I know, you're not going to wait 100 years to draw it out. So the first question is, do you think that defining Lone Star in the sulfide is at 10 year $300 million project or a five-year $100 million project or faster in terms of firming up that 50 billion or 70 billion pounds? Then second question and forgive me for thinking outside the box a little bit. I remember when Freeport sold everything to just be Grasberg, because Grasberg looked so good back 25, 30 years ago. And this isn't a good time to sell everything and just be Lone Star, because the market's afraid of a gazillion things. It wouldn't give you a good price, if you sold the mine. Why not distribute Lone Star to shareholders or Safford to shareholders and have two pieces of paper where Safford is 100% owned in Arizona, you probably could have a smart tax-cut figure out how to preserve the tax shields that wouldn't pay taxes. And Lone Star alone might command over $5 billion of your market cap of $20 billion and based on the questions people are asking you they don't understand your company today. Richard Adkerson : Yes well \u2013 John Tumazos : Excuse me for throwing all that at you, Richard but\u2026 Richard Adkerson : John you never -- we worked 30 years together and the last thing I would do is expect you not to think out of the box. So that's \u2013 no, I appreciate your question and I understand your thought about it. So let me see. Going back to the first thing is\u2026 John Tumazos : How long does it take to drill it out? Richard Adkerson : Yeah, we are drilling it out. We have been drilling it out and we've upped our budget for drilling this past year. We're spending about $8 million a quarter. We are directing resources there away from some other greenfield efforts that we had and other things and we expect that we will have a good understanding of this ore body by early next year. And it's a question of drilling it out, developing high level models of what the -- going through that whole process that you're so familiar with I suppose and then doing metallurgical test work to see what's there. And so far you've see the grades, you've see what we've seen so far and it just keeps expanding in terms of its breadth and depth. And that's why we see it. And it's right there in the backyard of our total operation. I don't think it makes sense to take Lone Star itself out. We'll take on board this whole idea, but there's just these huge benefits of having this America's operations as a single business. And as I look what other companies go through in terms of dealing with joint venture operations and issues related to safety and all the things that go into it, I don't know if I should expect, I don't expect people just from a pure investment logic standpoint to understand just what a massive synergy that is for our company and what it is. So we're going to as I said focus on doing what we're doing the next two years. There'll be strategic opportunities for us to look at it in the long run but not now. And because we still you hear from the questions skepticism about our ability to upgrade. We're very confident, but I appreciate we're in a show me mode. So we need to get Grasberg in a position of where it's once again like it was when you said. I still remember, George Putnam died this past quarter. He was our Director when I first joined the company in 1989 that when we first saw what Grasberg was and we were making decisions. As you said we focused on that. We did. We shutdown everything, sold all these assets. That was a good year at my job when we first joined the company. It was the first three, four years we're selling assets all over the world. And George said, play the card that's dealt you. He said that at one of my first Freeport Board memories and that was Grasberg was dealt to us. We made a decision. This was a company that five, six years earlier it passed on Escondido and let Rio Tinto vibe because of political risk in Chile. Anyway Kathleen's telling me to go on. Those are all war stories. So we understand what you're saying. We're going to have a broad mind about what we do with this company but for two years we're going to have a focused mine. We're going to do what we just laid out we're doing. Kathleen Quirk : And John, I know you know this, but as we're doing the oxide projects that really improves the value of the underlying sulfide resource, and we've got this great opportunity not only for the first initial project that we're completing next year, but additional expansion opportunities to the oxide and those are NPV positive projects and then just make those sulfides more valuable. So we're really, really, really excited about the resource there and again that could be a cornerstone asset for this company for years to come. John Tumazos : Thank you. Richard Adkerson : And I'll throw out a commercial. If you want to -- if you have any interest in the history of what's happened to Freeport and where we've gotten to I'm speaking to the Melbourne Mining Club in London at its meeting on June 20. So we're going to have a full discussion of how we got to where we are. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks. Next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Andreas Bokkenheuser. Your line is open. Kathleen Quirk : Let's move on maybe we can come back to that one. Operator : The next question is from Chris Mancini with Gabelli & Company. Your line is open. Chris Mancini : Hi, everybody. Just so quick on Lone Star again. So the concept is that you don't necessarily have to strip all of the -- mine all of the oxides before you get to the sulfides. Richard Adkerson : Yes we do. Chris Mancini : Okay. And so with that\u2026 Richard Adkerson : It's just like overburdened\u2026 Mark Johnson : Just like Cerro Verde. Richard Adkerson : Like Cerro Verde was, like all these other mines that are other companies in the industry too. They got to move overburden to get to the ore and it's just fortunate this overburden is leachable and now it's profitable. Chris Mancini : But is it 200 million pounds a year and then you have -- is it 5.6 billion pounds of oxide ore and so wouldn't that be a really long time before you get to the sulfides? Richard Adkerson : It's expanding, yeah, and you know and we could -- we can make investments in facilities to shorten the life of the oxide ore. Right now it's designed to use the facilities at Safford, which are available. But as we go through this process of understanding this sulfide ore, so understanding more about the oxide ore. So what we could do is scenario here, where the scenario if oxide ore does expand, build some new facilities, mine it out quicker shorten its life, get to the sulfide earlier. Chris Mancini : Okay. So the concept would be what we would likely see would be first an expansion of oxide production at Lone Star and then you'd be defining the sulfides and just show us instead of say 200 million pounds a year for 20 years. It could be -- you could show us 500 million pounds for 20 years or something like that, which includes the sulfides? Richard Adkerson : Or 500 million pounds for a shorter period of time. And during that time, you could then invest in the sulfide infrastructure and so forth at the same time. So it'd be a concerted project because this would be a major sulfide mine in how long Cerro Verde took us to red to\u2026 Mark Johnson : From start permitting seven years... Richard Adkerson : seven years. So all of this fits together. Chris Mancini : All right. Okay. But the first step would be we would see an expansion of the sulfides and the capital needed for that more\u2026 Kathleen Quirk : Essentially oxide right. Chris Mancini : Sorry, right, right expansion of the oxides. Okay, guys. Okay, thanks. And then quickly just on El Abra so what\u2026 Richard Adkerson : All I'll say is think about a company with that kind of core asset. Here we've got Morenci, Cerro Verde, Grasberg. They're not mines like this. I mean you look at the biggest mines in the world and now people have got things going on now there that are different, but the top 10, 12 mines in the world, Grasberg's the youngest. And to be able to take a company like ours and plug in that asset in that neighborhood with that kind of ore with what we're good at that's a huge deal. Chris Mancini : Yeah, I agree and it's low tax, I mean no taxes like you said, and also\u2026 Richard Adkerson : 40-plus percent taxes in Indonesia and damn near that much in Chile. Zero tax. That's a lot of money. Chris Mancini : And then \u2013 yeah, and also as you expand the oxide you should be able to get benefits from economies of scale at Lone Star. So the unit cost should decline, so yeah that's a huge\u2026 Richard Adkerson : And by the way, there's a big sulfide deposit under Safford. Chris Mancini : Right. Okay. Yeah. Richard Adkerson : All of that comes in. It's a district. I mean, this is not just, I don't know it's exciting. I know people are worried about China and this two-year transition. We should take a longer-term view of this company, and we really, we really have some great assets. Chris Mancini : Yes. It's fantastic. Okay, great. And then on the El Abra expansion, what are you waiting for there in terms of committing to doing that? Do you need to do more engineering or is it an issue with your partner Codelco needing to\u2026 Kathleen Quirk : We're doing some value engineering to try to bring the capital cost down and at the same time moving the studies along for the U.S. projects, because what we're wanting to do at the end of the day is compare the economics and pluses and minuses of the various projects and rank them sequence them. So really we're aligned with our partner and taking this time really try to improve economics, while we look at these other options in the U.S., where we are doing work to try to develop concentrating facilities at a lower capital intensity than what's been done historically. So we're taking this time to improve economics, reduce capital intensity, and drive values, while we're ramping up Grasberg and watching this market situation. Chris Mancini : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Richard Adkerson : Thanks, Chris. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Michael Dudas : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Just one question. So as you think about Freeport and looking at investments going forward, and looking at the industry and what you've talked about out in Chile a couple of weeks ago. If Freeport was two years out 2021 and Grasberg was humming and everything is doing well, would you be changing how you think about capital allocation investment in the business given where copper is at $2.85 $2.90 today. And do you think others in the industry are going to be still rather cautious in bringing up and making some investment decisions on these expansion projects? Or do you sense there's going to be an acceleration because of this perceived gap that everybody is pointing towards five years, 10 years from now? Richard Adkerson : So I can see a range of scenarios between what you just said, but you start out with a base of saying, despite we're seeing this time last year everything was rosy. It changed in the summer with the trade war stuff and then everybody started raising questions about China. Now China is taking steps to use its tremendous financial resources to stimulate its economy to offset the weakening consumer export business. They're investing in infrastructure in the country. They're revamping the one belt one road thing, and that's good for resources. So -- but there's all these questions about what's going on globally. Economically, the political situations complicated everywhere around the world. And so everybody's stepping back and thinking about how that's going to unfold? And you've got, I guess, I've lived through maybe three generations of CEOs in this industry, and you've got history of companies that have been on the burden of making bad investment decisions or strategic decisions, so you've got a structure of where boards and managements are understandably conservative about what they're going to do, that's all going to be good for the outlook for the commodity. And then just the resources are very limited. And so I really think this two years from now where we're going to be and I'm really looking forward to being there as I'm happy to be where I am now, but two years from now things are going to be better. We're going to be in a position to generate a lot of cash, and I'd love to return cash to shareholders. That was a lot of fun and get back to that as we look for chances to invest. And it's kind of like history repeating itself. That's where we were beginning 2010 going in 2011. And so I think it's going to be a time of generating cash, really getting the balance sheet strong. I was happy with zero debt, and -- but be real disciplined about it the way we would approach to allocating capital. We've got some great projects. There's trade-offs that build in the lot of factors, and it's not just looking at the resource and grades, but the required capital, the tax structure, the energy cost, features and then the water accessibility and cost. All of the things will come into play. So I think where you see will be in a scenario with reasonable commodity markets success and execution in the last two years of generating cash, reducing debt, returning cash to shareholders to disciplined growth. Michael Dudas : Appreciate your observation Richard. Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from Lucas Pipes with B. Riley FBR. Matt Key : Good afternoon everyone. Matt Key here asking a question for Lucas. Just a there's been some reports about two landslides during the quarter. And I wanted to ask you if you maybe be able to provide a little bit more background on that. Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Well, we haven't had a land -- well, let's see\u2026 Kathleen Quirk : He's talking about I think about the mill. Richard Adkerson : The mill. Kathleen Quirk : Mark\u2026 Richard Adkerson : Well, let me set the stage. And then Mark's here to talk about it. So we had a real tragic accident in our overflow delivery system at Grasberg and this was a real heartbreaker for all of us, because we have a -- as part of that system we've had ore passes that we've used now for over 20 years where the ore is mined, crushed, conveyed to ore passes at the Grasberg mine level -- operations level. And it goes to these ore passes 600 feet, where it's dropped and to the mill... Mark Johnson : That's 600 meters. Richard Adkerson : 600 meters sorry Mark 600 meters then where it's dropped at the mill level and we've had series of these ore passes over the years. They operate it very well generally and we had an accident of where some ore got hung up in one of the ore passes. Two of our workers were in an unfortunate position and we're trying to examine why they were, where they were, but efforts were made to free this ore. It broke loose and covered these guys and they perished. And here we are with a system that literally maybe two months from now would've been retired and we hadn't had any accidents like it. So it's really sad situation. So that's one case which you maybe describing as a landfall, but that was an issue with our ore pass system. Then at our -- in the area that's above our mill, we did have some landfall events. This has always been an area of concern. You may have seen pictures of it, but this is a massive industrial development done in a challenging place with high elevation around it. Heavy rainfall and severe elevations. And over the years we've had a couple of cases of where we've had ground give way, particularly in times when it rains and dries out. This happens all around the island. It's not just where we are. But we had -- we've had a couple of events that have occurred recently there no one's got hurt hasn't been major impact of damage to our equipment -- we've had to do some cleanup, but this is things we've encountered in the past and sort of kind of part of what we actually deal with then physically where we are. But we haven't anything else. Red have we \u2013 Mark, do you have anything to add to that or? Mark Johnson : No. The one about the mill it was just as you said we're in this very deep steep valley of the mill. Facilities are tucked at the bottom of it. We had a natural event. It was about 900 meters above our north-south mill and very small amount of material, but it came down unexpectedly. It's very difficult to predict these natural events. They came down, we were fortunate that it buried the road near our stockpile. We've been continuing to manage that over the last month or so. It hasn't shown any activity. We built some barriers around any of the areas that we have people working below and continue to assess the situation. Richard Adkerson : Yes, and Mark makes a good point. It was a natural event, unrelated to mining. That mill has been there since 1972. It's been expanded massively over time. I don't know if it still is but back when I was managing insurance, it was the largest single site insurance risk and we haven't had any major -- with operations now for 40 years, we haven't had a major catastrophic event in any fashion there and this is certainly far from that. Matt Key : Got it. Thank you for that detailed response. And just one more for me if I could squeeze it in. We've seen a lot of large M&A take place this year in the mine space albeit on the pressure side with one included an unsolicited offer. Do you... Richard Adkerson : You're calling gold precious? Matt Key : Do you have a view on M&A kind of in base metals and do you consider an additional defenses given your current valuation in the market? Thank you. Richard Adkerson : So M&A is coming in the base metals business. Companies are large with great balance sheets. Every company's got its own story, so there's issues that might be barriers to it. But when you have a situation of limited resources and great assets and scarcity of assets. I think it's just inevitable that things will happen. Defenses, we don't have any extraordinary defenses. We're going to take actions to make sure our shareholders are well represented. We don't think now is the time to consider things like that and I will tell you my judgment is. It's not likely to be an immediate issue because of the circumstances of the industry. But the facts are as you can't predict M&A and I mean we're a great example of that. We were a company that had very limited access to capital and then Phelps Dodge presented itself we had action and things happened. So it's going to be driven more by circumstances and opportunities and not something that you can totally plan in for. Matt Key : Got it. Thank you for that color and best of luck going forward. Richard Adkerson : Thank you very much I appreciate that. Appreciate everybody's being on the call and we look forward to reporting you on our progress as we go forward and to the rest of this year. Thanks everybody. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning, and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at FCX.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet. Anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we would like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. We would like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K. On the call today with me are Richard Adkerson, our CEO; Red Conger, who runs our business in the Americas; Mark Johnson, who oversees our Indonesian operations; and Mike Kendrick, who oversees our molybdenum business. I will start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will review our performance of using the slide materials. As usual, after our remarks, we will open up the call for questions. We would like to note that the results we are reporting today for our second quarter slightly better than the financial estimates reported in our July 1st update. Today, FCX reported net losses attributable to common stock of $72 million, was $0.05 per share in the second quarter. After adjusting for net charges of $14 million or $0.01 per share, our adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $58 million or $0.04 per share. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the second quarter totaled $465 million, and a reconciliation of our EBITDA calculation is available on Page 29 of our slide deck. Our second quarter 2019 copper sales of 807 million pounds were in line with our April 2019 estimate of 800 million pounds with higher copper volumes from North America and South America offsetting lower copper volumes from PT Freeport Indonesia. Mine sequencing changes in the Grasberg open pit resulted in lower second-quarter 2019 gold sales of 189,000 ounces that compared with the April 2019 estimate of 265,000 ounces. This is a timing variance and we are affirming our 2019 sales estimates for both copper and gold of 3.3 billion pounds of copper and 800,000 ounces of gold for the year. Our second quarter 2019 average realized price for copper was $2.75 per pound, that was about 11% below the last year second quarter average of $3.08 per pound, and gold prices were slightly above last year's second quarter; they averaged $1,351 per ounce in the second quarter of 2019 versus $1,274 in the year-ago period. Our unit net cash costs were $1.92 per pound in the second quarter of 2019. Our unit net cash costs for the year are in line with our previous estimates of $1.75 average for the full-year. We generated operating cash flows of $554 million in the second quarter and our capital expenditures totaled $629 million. We ended the quarter with consolidated cash of $2.6 billion and our consolidated debt totaled $9.9 billion. We had no borrowings and $3.5 billion available under our revolving credit facility at the end of June. At the end of June, FCX declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share on its common stock and that dividend will be paid on August 1st. I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to a slide presentation on our website. Richard Adkerson : Thanks, Kathleen, and good morning. We are enthusiastic today to report today with all the good things that are going on here at Freeport. Starting with Slide 3, in the Americas, our Freeport team delivered on expectations, way to go Red. Production exceeding forecast principally at our mines in the U.S., costs were in line, safety performance was good and we are committed to achieving safe production is our highest priority. Our Freeport team is highly energized by new tools we have developed to increase productivity. The combination of data, artificial intelligence analysis and enhanced collaboration between our operators, IT team and business analysts, is creating these new tools. We have achieved early wins that give us some momentum and implement these tools on a larger scale. The Lone Star project in Eastern Arizona is advancing on budget and on schedule. We are past a halfway mark and on-track for first production by the end of the year. The initial project, we had 200 million pounds of copper and we are assessing low cost capital incremental expansions to build scale for what could well become a significant asset for us in the U.S. longer term. As reported, we modified our plans for final operations in the Grasberg open pit by adding a new area of mining that is enabling us to extend open pit mining beyond our previous expectations. These modifications delayed access to some higher-grade material, which we now plan to recover in the near-term. Our current forecast has us mining in the open pit through September, but we are likely to have the opportunity to extend open pit mining further subject to have the open pit interacts with the underground development. Recall that our past plans envision completion of open pit mining in 2018,so everything we are doing this year is in essence land yet for us. We are prioritizing safety as we proceed with mining and with the ramp up of the long-term underground mining, which is our future. The Grasberg is a remarkable ore body. We have now initiate right caving to allow the Grasberg to continue as a major contributor in the years to come. In the second quarter, we achieved a number of important milestones in the development of our underground mines. After years of investing in underground infrastructure, we have now begun to ramp up production. We exceeded expectations on key performance metrics in the second quarter. We are building momentum to meet our targets, which would result in high volumes with low cost and substantial free cash flows for the coming 20-plus years. We are affirming our annual sales guidance for 2019 and beyond. Our global Freeport team is laser-focused on execution. We are very disciplined in our cost management, capital allocation by following in a clearly defined strategy. With continued successful execution, we are confident that our strategy will deliver large and meaningful value to shareholders. Slide 4 represents the key metrics to bridge 2019 to 2021 and illustrates the benefits achievable over the next 18 months. Through execution of the ramp up at Grasberg, completion of the Lone Star project, stable performance in our operations in the Americas, we expect to increase copper sales volumes by approximately 30% and almost double gold volumes. This will result in an approximate 25% reduction in net unit cost, with all things being equal, and double our EBITDA and cash flows at current commodity prices. I personally believe potential for higher commodity prices exists. With a growing production profile at a time when copper markets could well be rising, our shareholders would have exposure to a positive long-term future in copper. Much of the capital investment needed to achieve this result has been spent. Ours are long-live assets that give us a strong base for solid cash flows for the future. Moving to Slide 5, the Grasberg minerals district is one of the premier assets in the history of the global mining industry. Today, production from the Grasberg open pit and surrounding ore bodies has totaled 36 billion pounds of copper and 54 million ounces of gold. This is notable since the district is one of the most recent major ore bodies to be developed in our industry and it still has a long life ahead as a significant producer. Our reserves are reported only through 2041, which is the date of our current mining rights, but currently identified resources are massive. Significant production is highly likely to extend beyond 2041. We are now completing mining from the surface of the Grasberg, as it is now become more economic to extract the Grasberg ore underground using block caving mining. In block caving, the ore collapse under gravity and there is no stripping or mine waste to deal with. Cave propagation in the Grasberg Block Cave is positive now, providing us increased confidence in successfully ramping up production. The rock type in the Grasberg Block Cave is very conducive to caving with no need for any preconditioning. We are now undercutting through drilling and blasting in the Deep MLZ mine in conjunction with preconditioning rock in that mine using hydraulic fracturing to manage rock stresses in this ore body. Our Company is a leader in block cave mining with decades of experience in operating block cave mines in the U.S. but also getting back to the early 1980s in Indonesia. With block caving, there is substantial upfront investment and we have been making these investments since 2003. Two-thirds of the underground development meters for these mines have already been achieved. We invested in underground infrastructure and a state-of-the-art autonomous underground rail system to deliver ore. Most of the capital cost to develop Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ are now behind us. The high level of upfront investment for block cave mines is offset by higher production volumes and low operating cost for an extended period of time. Block cave mining has a long life, which will benefit us as we go forward. On Slide 6, we show the designs. Well, the designs of our Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ mines are based on world-class standards. We use our experience at the world-class DOZ mine in previous underground operations to enhance and improve infrastructure construction, mining equipment, facilities, autonomous loaders, remote controlled equipment, ground support techniques, undercut blasting in cave management. The Grasberg Block Cave will be our largest contributor to copper and gold production following the ramp-up period. Reserves total at that mine about one billion tons of ore and high grades of copper and gold. GBC will have a very large footprint spanning over 80 acres when it reaches full rate and extend to 180 acres over the life of the mine. The size of this ore body - the sheer size of it will give us the ability to produce simultaneously from five production blocks, giving a scale, flexibility and assurance of continuous production. In substance, we have multiple mines in the GBC sharing the same infrastructure. We know the rock tides from our mining the same ore in the open pit for 30 years now and through drilling, the underground ore body. We are assessing the ore about 300 meters below the surface, which is created by the open pit. As we continue undercutting and adding draw points, cave expansion is expected to accelerate to ramp up to 130,000 tons per day in 2023. At the Deep MLZ mine, we commenced undercutting in the second quarter following our work to precondition the rock. Ongoing hydraulic fracturing operations with continued undercutting and drawbell openings in the two active production blocks in this mine are expected to enable us to achieve the ramp up schedule shown in Slide 6. We have a large inventory of drawbell openings at the Deep MLZ mine to support our ramp up schedule. At full rate, the production of these two ore bodies is projected to average 1.3 billion pounds of copper and 1.3 million ounces of gold per year. Higher ore grades from these deposits will enhance production in the early years. Average net unit costs are expected to average $0.30 a pound in the first five years at full rates at current cost, and this is notable and rare for large-scale operations in the underground in the copper industry. Slide 7 presents key performance indicators we are monitoring internally. We have included, for your information, a glossary of terms to assist you in reviewing this following the slides. We are now meeting or exceeding established milestones. Going forward, there will be pluses and minus, that is simply the nature of planning, but we have confidence in our comprehensive plan based on our knowledge of these ore bodies and experience with underground ramp-ups. We are now over the hump on the multi-year development meters needed to meet the ore bodies. The key for the future is to continue our undercutting to expand the mines, to open up new drawbells, to accumulate ore. We will be accelerating drawbell construction as the caves expand. Looking at Slide 8, the Lone Star project near our Safford mine - adjacent to our Safford mine in Eastern Arizona is progressing is on schedule and on budget. The initial project is economically attractive and low risk in established mining area with access to nearby infrastructure and experienced workforce. First production is expected at the end of next year. Initially, we are targeting 200 million pounds per year of copper production and expect to have opportunities to increase this target by debottlenecking with low cost investments. We are increasingly excited about the longer-term potential for this asset. The drilling results continue to be positive. The grades are higher than any of our existing mines in the U.S. and the risks are lower than in many other jurisdictions. We own 100% of this resource and the U.S., we now have a very highly favorable income tax regime, and for our Company, we face no income taxes for many years in the future in the United States. As we bring the oxides into production and as a result strip the deposit, there is a significant large and growing sulfide resource beneath that oxides, which will become economically compelling. We are not only generating returns from the oxide reserves, but by mining, we are also enhancing opportunities to add a new large-scale cornerstone asset to our operations in North America. Now want to move to Slide 9; we are undertaking a really exciting initiative that our team is very enthusiastic about, to use the power of expanding computing capabilities, to compile and analyze data in our day-to-day decision-making for our operations. Red is leading this effort in conjunction with Bert Odinet, our Chief Innovation Officer, and the team of other leaders from throughout our organization. Real benefits have been achieved in the initial stages of this initiative and momentum is accelerating. We are leveraging data analysis with collaborate across functions, arming our operators with tools and empower them to make decisions quickly based on real-time data. Results are measured in real-time to determine how they impact productivity. We initiated this process at our Bagdad mine in Arizona, as a test case, and the results are telling the story. Since late last year, our mill throughput is up over 10%, recoveries are up 1 percentage point, approaching 90%, and unit costs are down 10% to 15%. Safety and retention is better and all of this was placed in service in a very short period of time. A key to expanding of this success, and this is a fundamental strength of Freeport is that we manage all of our operations in our global portfolio of mining assets. We can readily and efficiently coordinate and implement processes across all of Freeport's global mining assets. Everyone has access to data and the results of the analysis. We have now begun to implement these tools and management approaches across the portfolio. We have set an aspirational goal of adding 200 million pounds of copper in our Americas operations reducing our cost with minimal capital involved. This in effect is creating a new concentrator for us. This would add substantial value. Typically a project to develop new capacity for 200 million pounds of copper might cost in the order of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. We believe we can achieve this simply by increasing productivity without incurring any significant capital. Our unit cost would decrease, which is key to unlocking value in our U.S. assets. Very exciting initiative, our operating teams are rallying around it. Their enthusiasm is high and contagious, which is - with our senior operating team last week in preparing for our earnings release. We will keep you updated as we expand this throughout our Americas operations. Slide 10 addresses copper market. As you know, uncertainties resulting from the trade dispute between the U.S. and China have been impacting copper prices for a year now. These uncertainties are affecting confidence level at some of our customers and to a limited degree short-term demand. However, the global copper market remains balanced, fundamentally strong, inventories continue to be low in relation to historic norms. Supply development our industry continues to be supportive of copper prices. Industry disruptions this year are at a higher rate than last year. Mine supply this year is expected to decline despite some new production coming on stream. We continue to see long-term support for copper prices from the issues in developing new suppliers. High-quality ore bodies are increasingly scarce. Resource nationalism continues to be an issue around the globe. Current producing mines are aging, grades are falling. As economic uncertainties diminish and global economic growth improves, copper will be an important component of that growth. We remain very positive about the outlook for copper long-term, underpinned by limited suppliers coupled with important and growing role copper plays in the global economy. Before turning the call over to Kathleen, who will cover the financial outlook, I'd like to close with Slide 11, by just reiterating the inherent value FCX has in this asset. Copper as a commodity is one of the best position from a fundamental standpoint. New discoveries in this industry are extremely rare and development opportunities and limited, any development requires multiple used to execute with substantial and unavoidable risk. All of the above is becoming more evident overtime, and all of this makes the existing long life of mine such as the mines we own at Freeport more valuable. The current cost, as I mentioned earlier, to develop new capacity approximates $8 to $10 a pound. Applying this measure to our existing develop producing capacity, on a copper equivalent basis translates into a theoretical replacement cost value of $36 billion to $45 billion. In reality, it would be very difficult to replace these assets at any cost. This replacement cost value significantly exceeds our current enterprise value with no value assigned to our large undeveloped resource position, which I believe will ultimately prove to be highly valuable for our Company. We will continue to execute our plan, build our cash flows, deliver value from our portfolio for the benefit of shareholders. I'm personally looking forward to being part of the Freeport team as all of this unfolds. Kathleen? Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, Richard. I'm going to go over the financial outlook, starting on Slide 13, and we show here the sales outlook for 2019 through 2021 and is broadly consistent with our previous guidance. You will see our copper sales growing by approximately 200 million pounds in 2020 and 900 million pounds in 2021 compared to 2019. This includes the scheduled ramp up of production at Grasberg and the commissioning of our Lone Star mine in late 2020. In 2021, we expect just over two-thirds of the copper production will be produced from the Americas and the balance from Indonesia. This outlook does not include the opportunities being pursued with technology and innovation that Richard discussed earlier. And as discussed, we are targeting an aspirational goal of adding 200 million pounds of copper through these initiatives. We are also ramping up gold production during this period with high grades available to us in Indonesia. And as many of you know, Grasberg is one of the largest gold mines in addition to being a significant copper producer. Molybdenum sales are flat over the period that we have the ability to increase production rates from our primary molybdenum mines if market conditions warrant. Moving to Slide 14, we have modeled our EBITDA and cash flows at various prices to provide you with a range of the cash earnings and cash flow generating capacity of the Company. And you also get a feel for the leverage we have to improving market conditions. At $2.75 per pound of copper around the current price, we are in a $2.8 billion range for EBITDA 2019. This is a trough year for us, and as you see from the modeled results, we would generate approximately $4.4 billion to $6 billion in EBITDA in 2020 at this range of prices, and that would grow to $7.4 billion to $9.5 billion EBITDA for the average of 2021 and 2022. This is more than a double of cash flow and most of the capital required to be able to achieve this is behind us. Now it's up to us to execute and over the next three to four quarters will continue to derisk the plan as we hit the milestones set out. The story is the same for operating cash flows at the bottom of the page here on Slide 14. That is net of our cash taxes and interest costs. Our operating cash flows grow from roughly $2 billion in 2019 to over $3 billion in 2020, which is sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and our dividends, and we expect the average of 2021 and 2022 at these copper prices from $3 to $3.50 range from over $5 billion approaching $7 billion at $3.50 copper. And we expect capital expenditures to decline beyond 2020, which will supercharge our free cash flow. On Slide 15, we show our projected capital expenditures for 2019 and 2020. This includes sustaining capital of roughly $1 billion per annum and the projects we have under way that are allowing us to grow our cash flow so significantly. We are continuing to manage capital very carefully. You all know the capital costs are up slightly from our April estimates. The primary driver for this is that we are ahead of schedule on the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ work; our five-year average spend for the underground development is consistent with our previous guidance, but we have been a little bit more productive in 2019 and so we have adjusted the timing of our spend. These amounts do not include the new smelter in Indonesia in which FCX will share 40% of the economics. We expect to debt finance the smelter at the PT-FI level and are having some good discussions with the group of banks to put a facility in place to fund these costs. Moving to Slide 16, we show our financial position and liquidity. We are in a strong financial position. Our balance sheet is in good shape. If you look at our leverage relative to the expected EBITDA generation, our current net debt is around 2 times 2020 EBITDA and about 1 time 2021 using $2.75 copper. We also have a strong liquidity position with $2.6 billion in cash on hand and an undrawn $3.5 billion facility. In closing, going to Slide 17, we are gaining real momentum in achieving our objectives, clearly focused on executing our plans in an effective way and have a line of sight for meaningful increase in our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Thanks for your attention. And operator, we will now open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Chris Terry : Good morning. Hi, Richard and Kathleen. Three questions from me, quite quick ones. On the smelter, when can we expect any updates on the timing of that? Second question is just around thinking about the open pit to underground transition. Can you just give an update on mill stockpiles and also any port inventory that you have just on the differences between sales and production? And then the last one, just the timing of the Slide 9 that 200 million pound opportunity you've talked about, if you could talk about that a bit further? Thanks. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, Chris. On the smelter, we started early works in ground improvement. We have got a site located in Gresik near the existing smelter in Indonesia and we are doing some front-end engineering work. So we will have better estimates at the end of the year in terms of capital cost. As I mentioned, we are having good discussions with lenders about financing the smelter and expect - we are not expecting a significant cost of the smelter in 2019. It will start ramping up some in 2020, but the bulk of the spend will be later in 2021 and 2022. But we expect to have a debt financing in place that will allow us to fund those costs and essentially amortize them over a long period of time. Richard Adkerson : Our commitment with the government was to do it within five years of December 2018. So that is the time schedule, that we are working on is to have the project running by the end of 2023. Kathleen Quirk : Your question about production and sales; we generally sell what we produce. Sometimes, we will have shipping delays that extend over a short period of time, but we don't have significant board inventories. We have wound those down and we don't have significant stockpiles at this point. So we are basically in normal operations. Slide 9, Richard, your comment asked about the timing of the 200 million pounds of - Richard Adkerson : So we expect to ramp up getting in the next year and by mid-2020 to be at that full production level. But as we speak in our recent meetings, we are seeing opportunities to be able to expand that with incremental oxide production with reasonable amounts of capital to go along with it. Right now, we are being able to use available facilities at the Safford mine for processing, which that mine is ramping down is expected, but the opportunities for future growth in oxide is there and of course, we have spoken about the very large longer-term sulfide resource available to us. Kathleen Quirk : And that is with respect to Lone Star, Chris. I think you were also asking about the innovation project, which we are moving very aggressively on. We have achieved the results at Bagdad. We have got more to come at Bagdad and the aspirational target that we have set of 200 million pounds, this is something we want to do quickly. We are working on blueprints and designs and we don't have a - we haven't put it into our guidance. So we don't have a projection, but we have optimism that we will be able to convert that aspirational goal into results. Mark Johnson : Yes. We have a full blown of team on the ground at Morenci right now, putting that one in place, and get ready to go to the next point after that. Richard Adkerson : It's a very great opportunity for this and this, you know, what this does is and we didn't know exactly how it would work, we went to Bagdad, that really work quickly and now it looks to be sustainable . And so by increasing mill throughput, then you have to adjust your mine plans to feed that capacity in that, in effect shorten your reserve life and we have got enormous reserve life. So all of that so economically positive for us. And I can tell you the way our team has responded to see our long-term mining executives being excited about data analytics. It is quite an exciting thing to see. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Korn : Hi, good morning everyone. Just a couple of questions from me. On the undercutting, on the drawbells development, everything looks great. What exactly there is allowed the faster pace versus plan, and do you think you were very conservative at the outset? And then second, continuing, can you give an example of the concrete kind of process change that the data analytics at Bagdad have led to, and with really driven these op improvements you've shown? Thanks. Richard Adkerson : Okay. So Mark, why don't you comment on this? Mark Johnson : Yes. As far as the undercutting and drawbelling, I don't think we were conservative in the GBC. We have some upside. We try to use a central estimate when we put our forecast together. We look at opportunities to be slightly better and where the risk would be or the challenges would be on the downside. We do have a lot of meters of development and in the undercutting right now, all of that drifting is well in advance of where the undercutting is taking place. So a lot of the undercut meters are essentially just the drilling and blasting the final stage of that. And so we are going to continue to use the central estimate way of forecasting, and this year, we are looking at having marginal upside on both the Deep MLZ and GBC in regard. On the Deep MLZ, obviously, this year, a lot of it was driven by our ramp up of the hydrofracking. In the second quarter, we commissioned our third hydrofracking pump and that went well. So we are continuing to see the cave respond to that preconditioning, and that will be something that we continue to press forward on and it was a learning curve for us. I'm proud to say that the group out there took that technology and ramped it up very quickly, and it's part of our day-to-day operations now in the Deep MLZ. Richard Adkerson : And a point I'd like to make is, this is not a new plant. I mean, we have had a plan that we started on 15 years ago that envisioned during this time frame. In fact, it was envisioning starting in 2016, but because of issues at the surface in the pit, it was delayed. So we have had this consistent plan. The guys have done a great job of being focused on it despite everything else that was going on at job site in Indonesia. And that plan just keeps get modified and improved as we go through time. So it's not like this is a new plan that is been developed, but consistent execution of a long-term plan. Red will talk about this AI initiative, but for years now, we have been using measurement devices, own equipment, to get information to supervisors who then take it and feed it back to operators in the field. What this does is take that fundamental process, but gathers the data processes it immediately, compares it to what would be optimal conditions and where it's falling short and getting that data instantaneously in the hands of our team to make those adjustments in real-time and continuously. Red. Red Conger : So it's a combination of many things using this model, but it's a great way to bring our people together around facts and data versus opinion. So, it allows us to challenge paradigms, any rules of thumb or conservatism that we might have in managing the processes before. Now, we are doing it by fast and quick turnaround of information, as Richard mentioned, and it's truly a way to have your best day every day that you can take the conditions that are presented to you today and perform absolutely at the top opportunity available to us and see that every day. It also has our people working together much differently and collaboratively than they have in the past. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Chris LaFemina : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my call. I just have actually two questions. One is a quick one on Grasberg, and the second is on the data analytics and technology innovation. So first on Grasberg, I'm just curious as to why your full-year byproduct credit estimate is unchanged despite the fact that you are gold price that you are using in the byproduct has gone from $1,300 to $1,400 an ounce and your production of gold is unchanged for the year? Is there a small rounding difference in the gold sales number for the year or I would have expected the unit cost number to be quite a bit lower actually being that using a higher gold price. So just wondering why the Indonesian costs are not lower despite high gold price? That is the first question, maybe we could start with that. Kathleen Quirk : Okay. The gold credit will be a function of what the gold revenues are in relation to the copper volumes and there was a slight change in copper volumes for the year. It wasn't a big number, but we increased copper by - from [625 to 630] (Ph). So it wasn't a huge difference, it was $0.02 variance between the two numbers, but it's a relation of what the gold volumes are in relation to copper. Chris LaFemina : And I just wanted to make sure there wasn't anything going on with price realizations there? So that is helpful, thank you. Secondly, on the data analytics and technology innovation, we are starting to hear from other copper mining companies as well about their expected ability to begin to ramp up production from debottlenecking and using technology and innovation. And historically, we have looked at copper as an industry where you have kind of a natural decline rate in production, which is obviously pretty bullish at pricing. Are there any reasons why we should believe that your ability to debottleneck effectively using technology is unique to Freeport or should we begin to worry about the ability of the industry to kind of deliver organic growth from very low capital cost projects using technology and innovation? Richard Adkerson : I think the real distinguishing feature for our Company is this idea that we manage all of our operations as in a fact one business, and is not where you have joint venture operations or minority interest in other operations. So, it allows us to do things and share it from mine to mine to mine. Technology is going to drive things as we go forward. We are working with our suppliers in applying technology to underground mining, which in reality probably is a more fertile area for application of this an open pit mining because of the more factory nature of that business. So it'll be a factor in the industry going forward. You know other factors in my view are going to be more important in terms of looking at ultimate supply demand impacts for the industry and that is this whole issue of global growth and the things that overhanging the market from the demand side and just the issues of these things might help offset falling grades, but grades are falling and you see in project after project the challenges that are faced in terms of developing suppliers whether those relate to processing issues, ground support issues, government issues with resource nationalism. So it will be a factor. We are certainly going to take advantage of it to the maximum extent we can. I don't believe big picture that this is going to be a game changer in terms of the fundamentals of supply and demand for copper. Chris LaFemina : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera with CIBC. Oscar Cabrera : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Kathleen Quirk : Good morning, Oscar. Oscar Cabrera : Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. I was wondering if you can comment on the increase in site production and delivery costs in South America going to a $1.92 a pound from $1.73. I understand there was an issue with production, i.e. grades, but is there anything else like push backs or higher throughput that you putting through Cerro Verde where there are affecting costs? Kathleen Quirk : Oscar, it was primarily - at Cerro Verde, we had some different ore types that we mined in the second quarter and so we had some issues to work through there. That is the main driver was the ore types in the second quarter at Cerro Verde. Richard Adkerson : As we got to the bottom of the Santa Rosa pit, we had some slope issues that kept us from extracting the high grade pushback down there, Oscar, to finish that off. So where we are trying to stabilize that and get back in there and get that ore, but it's not lost. It was just a timing change in the mine plan. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. It's a temporary change. Red Conger : There is no fundamental change in the cost structure there and we expected to have stability issues quarter-to-quarter, but we expect long-term stability in our cost structure at Cerro Verde. Oscar Cabrera : Right. Because I mean your throughput is well above the 360,000 tons per annum, so we can expect like increased production over the next 12, 18 months then? Richard Adkerson : Yes, I mean we are having to - the mill is performing so well. I mean, this is the industry's largest mill and that we are having to beat that mill and find ways of adjusting our mine plans to move production forward and all that is very positive from a value creation standpoint. Oscar Cabrera : Fair enough. Red Conger : So that it was higher throughput, but lower grade, and Mark Johnson just reminded me we are recovering at El Abra from the flooding incident that happened in the first quarter. So there is a delta at El Abra on pounds as well. Richard Adkerson : El Abra was ground zero for the floods and in Northern Chile and Peru and our team there has done a great job in not only recovering for our operations but helping nearby communities to deal with their problems. Oscar Cabrera : Yes. Now that is forgotten about that. And then lastly, your comments on the debottlenecking of the Lone Star leased development. What sort of delta could we be looking at here as of 20 million pounds, 25 million pounds, 40 million pounds per year? Richard Adkerson : It's too early to do that right now. We are focused on the initial project just is as we did that as we reviewing with our team, guys were brainstorm and saying, okay, we have this opportunity, this opportunity. The next stage will be to evaluate how those new opportunities match up with capital requirements for processing and so forth. So, we are going to be alert to studying it. But here and throughout our operations, we have got two years of real disciplined. We have got a plan. We are going to execute this plan. We are not going to get off course pursuing opportunities to aggressively right now. We are going to study things and make sure we get the benefits of this transition period behind us and then the world is going to open up to Freeport in a remarkable way. Oscar Cabrera : Alright. Yes, it will. Thank you, sir. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Orest Wowkodaw : Hi, good morning. Just curious on the smelter as well at Grasberg. Do you anticipate that 100% of the $3 billion CapEx will be debt financed? And then secondarily, will you not have to add the CapEx or consolidate that in terms of the smelter CapEx to your consolidated financial CapEx? Kathleen Quirk : Yes. We consolidate PT Freeport Indonesia and so the capital expenditures incurred by PT-FI are consolidated in FCX's results. So they will be part of our consolidated results, but the economics and we have a shareholders' agreement between FCX and our partner there, the Inalum, the state-owned company, where smelter cost are shared according to the ownership of 49% to FCX. So we will consolidate it, but the economics and cash flows associated with it will be borne 49% by FCX and we do anticipate being able to finance substantially all, if not all the smelter. PT-FI doesn't have any debt. And so, it's in a good position and we have had some positive feedback from some lenders about financing for PT Freeport Indonesia for this project. Richard Adkerson : In the past, we have look at alternative structures. In other words, we have looked at potential opportunities to create partnership and create an entity that might or might not be consolidated. So we have left ourselves this option. It now appears that the best course of action considering all factors would be to debt finance it through PT-FI, but other alternatives may emerge as the reality of this thing occurring it's accepted in the marketplace. Orest Wowkodaw : Okay. So should we anticipate then at some point in the future, you will say update your 2020 CapEx guidance of $2.6 billion to include the smelter? Richard Adkerson : Yes. Orest Wowkodaw : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Michael Dudas : Good morning, everybody. Following up on the Indonesian comments, Richard, just wanted to maybe you can share how the joint venture from a personal corporate business level government level has gone over the past, I guess, from almost six months now, but more than six months and relative to your expectations and how you've been able to manage the successful transition that we looking at for the second half of the year? Richard Adkerson : I'm pleased to say could not have gone better. It was a - as we talked about extensively to understated leading up to December and getting that step taken to resolve all the issues between us and the government. The partnership with Inalum is going very well. We have established the corporate structure where we have a shared Board of Commissioners, shared Board of Directors. We have an operating committee that FCX controls, that run this is operations at site but Inalum participate in it on a partnership basis. We have a total alignment of financial interest. Inalum financed the acquisition of Rio Tinto's interest in the joint venture through an international bond offering that we have facilitated. They need the cash flows to fund that. It's not government guaranteed. We are swapping ideas. They have got people working in our organization. We had represents of Inalum that are FCX managers meeting last week; we are participating in their Inalum functions. It's gone well during that six-month period. Indonesia has had Presidential elections, which kind of dominated public focus there. President, Joko Widodo, has now been officially cleared as having a new term. There is considerations we understand going on about the structure of government going forward. But, we couldn't be more pleased; the personal relationships are very positive. We have had the Inalum people visit us here in Phoenix to see our operations and meet our global team. So I couldn't be more pleased with the way things are going, and I anticipate this is going to be very successful going forward. As I said, we finally are in a position where our interests are totally aligned with the government of Indonesia and through this partner. Michael Dudas : It sounds encouraged to think, Richard, maybe just one follow. In the past, you observed how the ground business on the ground is relative to some of your the markets for copper and there is been a lot of negative data points especially in North America relative to the economy. Are you seeing any issues relative to demand, and you believe your copper and others and is the market maybe kind of soften a little bit given some of the macro data we have seen? Richard Adkerson : It was incredibly tight throughout 2018. And going into 2019, we were literally - we supply a third or more of the downstream copper in the U.S. from our mines in the U.S.. We virtually do not import or export the copper in the U.S.. And we were having to back limited amounts of copper from traders to meet the demands of our customers. So they are some pockets of softening which are evident in the general economy, but overall, the markets remain tight. Many of our customers are very positive going forward, others are concerned about the trade issue and the ultimate impact on the global economy. But inventories you see their publicly reported, they are what they are and they're low by historical standards. So we continue to be at that crossroads and the crossroads are this trade issue going to result in broader economic impacts in China and the global economy or is this thing going to get resolved in a way that avoids those. Within China itself, the government is working very actively to offset areas of softness in their economy by stimulating investment - investing in infrastructure, pushing this Belts and Roads initiative to use excess capacity and they're having some success doing that, but it's a question mark that we or nobody has the answers to at this point. Michael Dudas : Appreciate your observations. Thank you, Richard. Richard Adkerson : Yes. There is certainly no falling off the cliff situation with our customers. But as I said, there is concern and we are at a crossroads. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Timna Tanners : Okay. Good morning. And just two for me. So I know on the guidance that you gave earlier this month, there is some comment about potential upside to your forecast. So, I see that you didn't revise them and I'm just wondering at what point do you feel like you have conviction to comment further on your run rate or your ability to recoup additional volumes from the open pit mining extension? Richard Adkerson : Alright. So this is very unusual mining for us. We are almost surgically looking at what remains in the open pit to see what we can capture. And so it's not like having a typical mine plan where you have mining areas designated in a specific plan to do. We are literally mining access roads that go down there. We are narrowing access roads from what to what, Mark. Mark Johnson : From 40 meters to 50 meters. Richard Adkerson : And all of that is just taking advantage because, obviously, anything we can get from the pit is accelerating it. That ore would ultimately be mined in the block cave, but for several years out. So it's real value added, but difficult to say where we are going to be able to get this ore, and at the same time, we are monitoring very carefully, the interaction of the beginning of mining from the Grasberg Block Cave and the safety of the pit itself. And we have got a whole team with state-of-the-art measuring devices. And if there is there any question about safety, we are just going to stop, because the real value strategy for us is to develop these underground mines. And so this - a year ago, we didn't plan to have any mining in 2019 from the pit. And we started finding ways of doing it. Right now, we have added in a quarter and we will see - I think it's likely it will go beyond that could go into 2020 now, but it's uncertain. But I want to make the point, this is not like our traditional mine plans in the pit or for the underground. It's surgically finding areas that we can safely mine and taking the advantage. Timna Tanners : Okay, helpful. Thanks. And then, I just wanted to follow up on something you commented on a couple months ago regarding plans for the dividend and I caught with interest Kathleen's excitement over cash flows as CapEx rolls off. But I just wanted to confirm, you are still waiting to get more certainty around the mine plan and your timing before thinking about any changes to your payout strategy. Richard Adkerson : That is correct. As I said, we are going to stick with a very straightforward focused strategy. It was two years, not 18 months, as we ramp up and after we ramp up and get the benefit of these cash flows, my expectation is the dividend is going to grow. Timna Tanners : Okay, thanks for that. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, Timna. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley FBR. Lucas Pipes : Hi, and good morning everyone and thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask about the export quotas. It mentioned a few times in the release and I wondered if you can provide some background, is that still related to the mining law and the smelter requirement and ultimately I assume this is a formality to get amended, but would appreciate your thoughts on kind of the background of the quota and kind of where it goes from here and any limitations it may cause. Thank you. Richard Adkerson : It is an administrative formality now. I mean the Energy and Mines Ministry has regulations and procedures to follow, and we have to adjust our plans as we adjust the mine plans for this limited open pit mining we are doing now. And so we had to follow those plans and the quotas get approved, and that is all it is to it. Lucas Pipes : Got it. And what exactly caused the need for change in the quota, given that guidance is... Kathleen Quirk : The way the process works is that we filed for the quota in like October of 2018, and they base it off of what your plan was then. Subsequent to that time PT smelting had some additional downtime and we ended up having more concentrate production in 2019 than what was in that forecast. So the process now is, we have to resubmit that plan, which we have done. And so we will - and it's not a big driver of our second half sales. It's important, we want to get it. We want to have some options if we do have the ability to extend in the open pit, but we have given them an updated forecast and we expect in the third quarter to get approval for additional quantities of export. Lucas Pipes : That is very helpful. Thank you. And then another question on the Grasberg Block Cave. You comment in the release about your increased confidence in growing production rates over time. How would you translate this increased confidence in numbers? Is it kind of a narrow range of potential outcomes around your guidance or how would you explain to them, where could we see that increased confidence? Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Well, let's see. We went into the year saying we had a two-year period. We have now got six months into that period and things are meeting milestones, going along plans. So as that occurs, our confidence is reaffirmed. Let me just say, we had confidence in our plan going into it. But I think I used the term earlier show me. Now, we have shown for six months. We are on target meeting targets, exceeding targets. So as time goes by, and we get to this ramp up; Mark and I had a conversation last week, I said, Mark, when we get this Grasberg Block Cave fully developed, how confident we are going to be in meeting quarterly targets and he said, well, Richard, we are going to have multiple draw points with ore available; if there is some mechanical issue in one, we can move to another and production blocks and so forth. So I made a comment earlier, it's like having multiple mines with one set of common infrastructure. So there will always be issues in mining. But we got so much back up, so many alternatives that we are confident that we are going to be able to meet our targets. Kathleen Quirk : Mark, you want to talk about cave propagation? Mark Johnson : Yes. It's - obviously, there is a lot of moving parts in the block cave. We built crushing and conveying systems. We built the rail system. All of those - all the commissioning of that went very well. So that - as those developed and as we got the commissioning behind us, that led to this increased confidence. The cave propagation, as you can see in some of the slides, we have got two separate areas that we are developing and undercutting right now. The material is very amenable to the caving process. It's - we have tried to identify and explain the difference between it and Deep MLZ. So what we are seeing now in both of those areas are good. We are able to go in and pull the cave and it fills up the air gap and we are getting our processes in place when we do need to secondary blast, and all of those things are coming together. We are really transitioning from a development project to an operating project. And as we increase that confidence in the group's taking on a new role, all of that is coming into place very well. Lucas Pipes : Gentlemen, Kathleen, I very much appreciate all that detail, and best of luck. Richard Adkerson : Thanks, Lucas. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. John Tumazos : Thank you very much. I could ask two questions. Can you give us an update on the capacity for the Cerro Verde mill? You had another strong quarter. I think the original capacity is 360,000 tons and maybe that varies with ore hardness. Secondly, congratulations on the block cave development, July 16th, the good people of Rio Tinto announced some delays in their block cave. Could you elaborate on the better ground conditions you have at the Grasberg Block Cave, you are transitions going so much better? Richard Adkerson : Okay. Red, do you want to comment on Cerro Verde mill? Red Conger : Yes. John, we have continued to have real good performance there. We are at about 400 right now. And with this other analytics where that we have been talking about artificial intelligence, et cetera, we have even a higher target than that we are aiming for with this project. So that continues to go well and we are very upbeat about that. John Tumazos : Are those metric tons? Red Conger : Yes. John Tumazos : Thank you. Richard Adkerson : And John, we - as you can appreciate, we are not going to comment on Oyu Tolgoi situation. But in our situation, we know this ground; this ore body at the Grasberg Block Cave, which is the biggest contributor to our future. It's the same ore that we have been mining for 30 years and we have drilled, I don't know, thousands of drill holes in it, and we have done all metallurgical test. And so we are demonstrating that we know the rock and it's as we keep saying, it's amenable for block cave mining in a very positive way. The separate or system, which literally started with the Ertsberg mine in the early 1970s and then is extended underground beginning in the early 1980s through - this is the fourth level of the same system that we keep going down again. We know the fundamental physical characteristics of the rock, what we encountered there, because as we have gotten deeper in that ore body, below the surface was this need to precondition the raw, but it's something that is consistent with what we have done in the past. Our challenges will be to manage wet muck which we've had in the IOZ, DOZ mines going forward, which we can manage, will have course material available to mix with ore so that we can manage that going forward. But we just don't have the same circumstances of unstable ground that others might face in commonly in the industry. John Tumazos : Thank you. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James. Brian MacArthur : Good morning. My question relates to post 2020. You've been putting in, you know, $750 million to $1 billion to develop Grasberg as you said since about 2003 to get everything ready. You talked about it dropping off past 2021. I'm just trying to get magnitude of drop-off and that ongoing, would we go down $500 million, because you still going to have earn so you could open up some of the other cave areas as we develop longer-term. Is it reasonable to assume that ongoing capital drops by $500 million in that ballpark? Kathleen Quirk : Well, our current plans show that capital drops off pretty sizably beyond 2020. We are going to be looking at the development of Kucing Liar. That is not in our current five-year plan. We want to get Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ optimize and up and running and spend the capital needed to do that before going in and attacking other projects. The KL deposit is not a big value driver for us, so we are not overly anxious, but we are - so we are going to be cautious over the next several years in how much capital we allocate and we are currently showing no capital falling off on the order of what you are saying, Brian. Brian MacArthur : Sorry, great - had led to a second question. Kathleen Quirk : Excluding the smelter, but putting all that aside, we see capital fall off. Brian MacArthur : Right, which kind of me to the other question. So when do you actually I mean, you have lots of flexibility in the GBC once it's up and running. When do you actually have to start looking at KL, if you want to do that? Mark Johnson : Yes. This is Mark Johnson. We are looking at the potential of starting development in that in 2021. As Kathleen mentioned, we are looking at different plans. We do have some flexibility when that starts up, as Kathleen mentioned. It's not the largest - the recoveries particularly in gold right now are a challenge. We are doing some work on metallurgical studies to see if there may be a better sweet spot of the ore body to enhance the value. Some of those studies also may reduce some of the mill capital associated with the KL. It's a work in progress and it lends itself, it also ties into the common infrastructure that we built for the GBC and the Big Gossan. So we are poised to start that development we know where we will start. We know what we need to do longer term, and we are just trying to refine the timing of that and the actual footprint of the ore body. Kathleen Quirk : And again just to look at the options to have a case where we expose less capital and look at the trade-offs of that, because some parts of the ore body may require a lot more capital, and so we are looking at trade-offs of not mining part of the pyrite, for instance, and that has some pretty big implications on capital. So that will be studies that are in front of us. There will be value-add studies. But as Richard said, we really focused on executing this first phase, optimizing in the first phase, and then looking at where we go from there. But currently, we don't have in our five-year outlook capital for Kucing Liar. Richard Adkerson : Or any metal. Kathleen Quirk : Yes, or any production. Richard Adkerson : And it is fair to say current copper prices would be unlikely to do this project in the future. I mean, you know, because it's got to bear the burden of in-country processing, which is - so anyway, it's a future opportunity and it does meet reserve standards at today's value, but I believe others in the industry are going to be fundamentally careful about investments pending the way the copper markets develop. Brian MacArthur : Great. Thanks very much. That is a very helpful color in the longer-term development. Richard Adkerson : Great to hear your voice, Brian. Operator : I will now turn the call over to management for any closing remarks. Richard Adkerson : Thank you all for participating in our call. We look forward to reporting, as I said is the story of the Freeport story unfolds. And if you have any follow-up questions, please contact David Joint. Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that concludes our call for today. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the Risk Factors described in our 2018 Form 10-K. On the call today, are Richard Adkerson, Red Conger, Mark Johnson, who is dialing in from Indonesia and Mike Kendrick and Mike runs our molybdenum business. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who will be referring to our prepared slide presentations. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for questions. Today, FCX reported net losses attributable to common stock of $131 million or $0.09 per share in the third quarter of 2019. After adjusting for net charges of $123 million or $0.08 per share, the adjusted net loss attributable to common stock in the third quarter totaled $8 million or $0.01 per share. Details of the non-recurring items are located on page Roman numeral 7 of our press release. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the third quarter totaled $564 million. We've got a reconciliation of our EBITDA available on page 28 of our slide deck. The third quarter 2019 copper sales of 795 million pounds were about 4% below the July 2019 estimates of 830 million pounds of copper, primarily because of lower production from Cerro Verde and also the timing of shipments at quarter-end. This was partly offset by higher production and sales from North America. In the third quarter of 2019, our gold sales of 243,000 ounces were about 6% higher than the July 2019 estimate of 230,000 ounces. The copper and gold production exceeded sales by 59 million pounds and 90,000 ounces [ph] in the third quarter. These volumes were an inventory at September 30th and are expected to be sold in the fourth quarter. Our average realized copper price was $2.62 per pound, that was below the year-ago average of $2.80 per pound. And the third quarter average -- 2019 average realized gold price of $14.87 per ounce was above the year -ago quarterly average of $11.91 per ounce. Our net unit cash costs on a consolidated basis, net of by-product credits, averaged $1.59 per pound of copper in the third quarter. That was slightly improved from the July 2019 estimate of $1.53 per pound. As anticipated, our average unit net cash costs were higher in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the year-ago average of $0.93 per pound. That reflects lower sales volume as PT-FI transitions mining from the open pit to underground. We expect that our net unit cash costs will trend lower as this ramp-up is completed. In the third quarter of 2019, we generated $224 million in operating cash flows and that was net of $146 million in working capital uses. Capital expenditures totaled $666 million in the quarter, which included investments in our underground projects and the new mine in Arizona that will be commissioned next year. We ended the quarter with consolidated cash of $2.2 billion and consolidated debt of $9.9 billion at no borrowings and $3.5 billion available under our revolving credit facility. I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to our slide materials that you've been provided with. Richard Adkerson : Good morning, everyone and thanks for participating in today's call. I want to share with you the enthusiasm that I personally feel about all we are accomplishing at the current time. Two week ago, I made a trip to Indonesia and went to job site to visit operations there. It was my first trip to job site in three years, as we've been focused on our work with the government. And I was truly impressed by the progress we're making underground and the morale and attitude of our team. I traveled to Jakarta, and while in Indonesia, met with the senior Ministers that we've been dealing with, with the CEO of our partner, Inalum and spent an hour with President Joko Widodo to fully review our operations. And I was gratified by the warmness of the conversations that we have and how positive everyone is about the arrangement we struck last December and how it's working to-date. And that was good. But I really want to talk to you about what's going on at Grasberg. This is one of three major initiatives of our Company right now that we're really focused on. The Grasberg underground ramp up is the most important of those and one that's really key to our future. The ramp-up is advancing on schedule. My own personal confidence in achieving success with this transition was enhanced. This will achieve low-cost long-lived production from our underground ore bodies and it will be a source of significant cash flows for the next 20 years plus. The significant mine development and infrastructure development is really impressive, as I said. Much of this is already completed and I met in detail with our team and observed their strength and the technical competencies, the experience and motivation to execute the plan. And you will see that we have had very positive initial results as we are reporting today in the third quarter and the year-to-date. All of this gives us strong confidence on our -- accomplishing our ramp-up schedule. The designs of the two minerals zones, the Grasberg Block Cave and the Deep MLZ are set to world-class standards. We are applying our Company's experience over the past 35 years in block caving in the underground and using new technology to enhance the infrastructure techniques, undercut blasting and cave management. And I'll talk some more about that later. Second of our three initiatives is the commissioning of the Lone Star project in Arizona. The current project to develop and mine oxide ores within our budget and on schedule for copper production is expected next year. The development is two-thirds complete and there are expansion opportunities that we've already identified in the oxide ore. The current project envisions using available capacity at the nearby Safford mine. But the need to oxide ore is a resource that is growing as we do exploration drilling and has the likelihood of being a major keystone asset for our Company in the future. The third initiative is something that's really exciting, and congratulate Red and his team for what they're doing in this innovation-driven productivity improvements. This is a program in which we are using technology tools, machine learning or artificial intelligence, and a coordinated operating structure that's bringing together different capabilities within our Company and applying it to basic operations to create value. We tested this at our Bagdad mine in Arizona and had remarkable success, and what was so encouraging for me is the enthusiastic way that our team has embraced this technology, which is a kind of a quantum jump from the basic work of mining to using new technology techniques to improve efficiency. What it's allowing us to do is to increase production, decrease cost without making major capital investments. We are now expanding this to Morenci and our other mines in the Americas, and we have not yet incorporated these in our numbers. We'll do that next year, but we have set an aspirational goal of adding 200 million pounds of copper from these initiatives with very little capital investment. And that would be a major accomplishment for us. Slide 4 addresses our strategy. And I want to emphasize that our strategy, at this point in time, is well-defined and focused. It is focused on growing our sales profile, being efficient driving cost down, and improving cash flow generation. And we're going to do this with the three initiatives that I spoke of earlier, driven principally by the Grasberg underground conversion. Success in these would result in a 30% increase in copper, 70% increase in gold, approximately 25% reduction in unit cost and a 100% doubling of our cash flow generation. This is all within our grasp. It's up to us to execute, but that's what our strategy is. And during this period of time that's built around the Grasberg transition, we are not looking to make major new capital investments, although we have great opportunities for the future. We're not pursuing M&A transactions, but building this, because this will have such a major impact on our Company. Much of the capital needed to achieve the results have -- has already been spent. These are long-lived assets, and it gives us a strong base for cash flows for the future. I personally believe there is a potential for higher [ph] current prices exist within the time frame of this transition. So if you look at a growing production profile at a time when copper markets may be improving, Freeport would have a very bright future in the near term. Slide 5 shows -- I'll talk about the Grasberg. Now we are at the final stages of mining the Grasberg open pit. I will tell you, it was almost a spiritual experience for me to be there and see the that you're seeing on the left. I was there more than 30 years ago and took my own picture with the Polaroid camera of the Grasberg exploration shack where the second portable drill hole was -- had just been drilled. There were no mine or anything there. Then to the -- on the edge of this -- and see what this picture shows. Here we are, after mining over 5 billion tons of material produced at the district, 33 billion pounds of copper and 53 million ounces gold, with a -- roughly a $100 billion of gross revenues and 80% of that's from the pit and then seeing this pit going three kilometers across -- a kilometer quarter deep, as I said, thinking about all of our history was something. But you know, that history, interesting for me, great story, but the future is in the underground and that is equally exciting. This is where our future production is coming from. Our company is an industry leader in block cave mining with decades of experience as I mentioned earlier. The Grasberg Block Cave represents about 50% of our underground reserves. It's the same ore body that we've been mining from the surface for the past almost 30 years. In block caving, the ore that's there, rather than being stripped and mined from the surface, collapses in the caves under gravity. So there is no stripping or mine waste. We will only have to mine about a third of the material that we've historically mined and produce more copper than we have in these -- all these years from the surface. Mining 1.1 billion tons of ore will be done without incurring the cost of mining 5.2 billion tons of ore and waste. The gross revenues from our reserves at the two mineralization areas that we will be mining at $3 copper and $1,500 gold will approximate $150 billion over the long run, and approximately 50% more than what we've already earned from the pit over the past 30 years. We only pull reserves through 2041 because that's when our rights extend to under our arrangements with the government, but resources indicate production will go well beyond 2041. This is developing these underground resources is not a new project. We have been undertaking underground investment since 2003. Over two-thirds of the underground development meters have already been achieved. We've invested in underground infrastructure, these enormous access to ventilations, large-scale crushers pushing rail transport and a state-of-the-art autonomous underground rail system. Most of the capital cost of the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ are behind us. On slide 6, we list our key performance indicators. I'll refer you first to the chart at the bottom right, the ore extraction. And you can see that we averaged over 20,000 tons from the GBC and Deep MLZ combined in the third quarter. And this exceeded our forecast. The Grasberg Block Cave has met, and in many cases, exceeded expectations, and the cave propagation in its mine advancements is going very well. The Deep MLZ is where two years ago, we experienced the seismicity issues because of incompetency of the rock. And we have developed systems to monitor that, micro systems that are placed throughout the ore body and that there are procedures to help us understand where these events may be happening. Earlier in the third quarter, we used this system to temporary suspend some advancement of drawbells and caving in one of the production blocks. But using the hydraulic fracking approach, that's working successfully for us now, we achieved the desired shape of the cave and we resumed undercutting in September. Now going forward in mining always, but in underground mining, there'll be pluses and minus simply the nature of mining and the planning. But we are now confident that based on our results today, that we have met the challenges this rock situation, the Deep MLZ. Spent a lot of time with our team talking about the hydraulic fracking operations at the Deep MLZ. I observed the operations and equipment that was being used, and I was extremely pleased with the results. At our wrap-up meeting, I ask our team, could I say that we can now state that we've effectively managed seismic activity going forward, and there was a resounding yes to that question. So this has been an exciting development for us. The Grasberg Block Cave will be our largest contributor production following the ramp-up. It has reserves of over 1 billion pounds of high-grade copper and gold -- 1 billion tons. The Grasberg Block Cave will have a very large footprint 80 acres at full rate and 180 acres over the life of the mine. The size of the ore body and the different headings that we will have will give us the ability to produce simultaneously from five production blocks giving a scale flexibility and assurance of continuous and predictable production. It's important to note that when we talk about this underground operation and we talk about these two mineralization zones at Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ. We actually have multiple mines within these zones and these mines share the same infrastructure. Our teams know the rock types from mining the same ore in the open pit for 30 years, mining the ore mineralization that's in the Deep MLZ for 25 years and we've done extensive drilling in the underground to understand ground conditions. We are assessing ore at the Deep MLZ only 300 meters below the surface of the open pit of the Grasberg.\\ As we continue undercutting and adding draw points our expansion is estimated to accelerate to ramp up to 130,000 tons per day in 2023. As I mentioned at Deep MLZ the ongoing hydraulic fracturing operations with continued undercutting and drawbell openings in two active production blocks are expected to enable us to achieve our ramp-up schedule for that mineralized area. We have a large inventory of drawbells already in place in Deep MLZ to support this ramp-up. At full rates the production from these two ore bodies is projected to average 1.3 billion pounds of copper and 1.3 million ounces of gold per year. Higher ore grades from these deposits will enhance production in the early years. Average net unit costs are expected to average at current cost levels, $0.30 a pound in the first five years of full rate. This is notable and rare for large-scale operations in this industry. And we have the opportunity to deal with cost effectively through technology innovations in the underground as we go forward. The key to the future is to clean your undercutting to expand the caves, to open up new drawbells to accumulate the ore. We expect to accelerate drawbell construction in 2020 as the cave expands. We are comfortable we are mitigating the inherent risk in underground mine. Turning to slide 7 and Lone Star. Lone Star is located adjacent to our existing Safford mine which began production at time of the Phelps Dodge deal around 2007 and is -- in the ore that is being depleted, although there is future potential sulfide development at depth there. But we have available facilities that are allowing us to have a low-risk development with good financial returns at the adjacent Lone Star wholly-owned ore body only 8 miles away from Safford, also 18 miles away across the mountains from Morenci. This is a $850 million initial project, two-thirds complete, estimated annual production of 200 million pounds and will be producing copper next year. It's oxide ore with low capital intensity with opportunities with low capital -- expansion opportunities with low capital intensive available to us in the oxide. And then our drilling at depth is really exciting, because of the sulfide resource that continues to expand and will be a big part of Freeport's future. Then to go back to this productivity project that we have been pursuing aggressively in recent months. This is on Slide 8. It's a development project without significant capital. The results of this as we've seen at our Bagdad mine increase production, improves its efficiency simply by doing things better and we do things better by measuring activities, by analyzing them quickly, using artificial intelligent type methods which involves involvement with broad areas of our team, getting data back and changing operations really efficiently. It's working well and it unlocks bottlenecks throughout the operations. We literally identify through data the best operations can do and instantaneously know when we're not achieving that and make adjustments to get back to the best it can do. And I can't tell you how excited our team is about it and what it's like for me to watch that enthusiasm and how it's spreading through our organization. Copper markets today are clearly affected by the trade war economic situation. But in my view, they are simply not sustainable. And the reason I say that is that even with the economic effects we're seeing, the demand for copper remains relatively strong throughout the world in China, in the US and elsewhere. Copper inventories are low. The future is bright because of the fundamental uses and the growing uses for copper in alternative energy generation and the future for our electric vehicles and just the general use of electronics throughout the world. When you hear a mining company talking about measuring things electronically, think about how other businesses are affected by this. So structurally the copper market remains very supported. It's essential to the global economy and then it's significantly supported by the scarcity of supply. Wood Mackenzie says it takes $3.30 to incentivize significant copper production, economic activity is going to affect demand in the near term. But we remain very positive about the outlook for copper and are prepared to deal with whatever price we have to do in the short term, but believe this is -- that we're in a great industry with great assets. So I'll close, before turning over to Kathleen, just by looking at the reason there is I started out saying I'm so enthusiastic about our Company. We've got a strategy that our Board, our management team has bowed [ph] into, on our shoulders to execute that. To do that we have a portfolio of high-quality assets. We look at our track record and our commitment to communities, environmental responsibility our technical capabilities that we've proven with our development project and the way we operate, we are the leader in our industry in terms of size, scale and durability. We operate all the mines that we have interest in. So we're able to share supply chains, technology, people, resources, we're going to have very significant growing production and cash flow profile within our site to doubling of our cash flow generation. Copper fundamentally is positive and increasingly so and then we have this innovation driving value creation that's going to spread throughout our organization. So beyond financial results which are affected by this transition issue that we have this has been a great quarter for Freeport. Kathleen? Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, Richard. I'm going to start on Slide 12 where we summarize the production and sales data for the third quarter by region. And starting at the top North America did better than our forecast and was up about 12% compared with last year's third quarter. We're seeing improved production performance from our leach stockpiles at Morenci, following initiatives that we've put in place to reduce the particle size of the material placed on leach pads. And we've also had some favorable changes in the chemistry of the ore. At Bagdad, as Richard was talking about, we're seeing -- we're continuing to see real benefits from the innovation and debottlenecking initiatives and Bagdad has become a real model for this initiative as we drive it across the portfolio. In South America, Cerro Verde as well as other mines in the region were impacted by restricted access to transportation outlets and that was associated with protests regarding the non-affiliated third-party development project. Our team at Cerro Verde did an outstanding job in managing the situation safely and efficiently in- the circumstances, but production was below the year-ago level and about 10% below our forecast. Because of lower mining rates and changes in mine sequencing we processed a greater portion of stockpile ore which impacted grades and recoveries. The lower mining rate in the third quarter will also impact the fourth quarter, metal production, but this has been offset by better performance in the US than our prior forecast. We want to note that despite the disruptions, the Cerro Verde concentrator averaged over 380,000 tons per day during the third quarter. That's above nameplate capacity of 360,000 tons per day and the team is optimistic that the AI and innovation initiative will drive further increases in the future. For Indonesia our sales in the third quarter were generally in line with our guidance. We did a little better on gold and have increased our estimates slightly for the year. We're continuing to mine a small amount of high-grade material from the surface. Our current forecast assumes we will continue this through November. But we also ended September with a higher level of concentrate inventory and we'll be working this down in the fourth quarter. We show a table at the bottom of Slide 12 which presents our consolidated production for the quarter and that exceeded our sales by 69 million pounds of copper and 90,000 ounces and this relates to timing of shipments of concentrate from Cerro Verde and also from Indonesia where we built some inventory in the quarter. This is simply a timing matter and we expect to sell this inventory in the fourth quarter and get back to normal levels of inventory by year-end. On slide 13 we're summarizing our consolidated sales outlook for the periods 2019 through 2021. The projections are in line and broadly consistent with our previous estimates. Our copper sales are expected to grow by roughly 200 million pounds in 2020 and 900 million pounds in 2021 compared to 2019. This includes a scheduled ramp-up of production that Richard referred to earlier at Grasberg, and the commissioning of our Lone Star mine next year. In 2021, about two-thirds of this copper production will be produced from the Americas and the balance from Indonesia. This outlook does not include the opportunities being pursued with technology and innovation that Richard discussed earlier and we're targeting the potential to add 200 million pounds of copper per annum through these initiatives. We also expect our gold volumes to rise over this period with high grades available to us in Indonesia and recall the district has high grades of both copper and gold in the same ore which makes Grasberg a low-cost valuable operation. Our molybdenum sales are generally flat over this period, but we have significant optionality in our portfolio and can adjust production rates from our primary mines if market conditions warrant. We refer you to page 14 where we've modeled our EBITDA and cash flows at various prices to give you a range of the cash earnings and cash flow generating capacity of the Company. You will note the significant positive leverage we have to improving market conditions on the slide. At $2.60 copper for 2019 we are in the $2.4 billion range for EBITDA for reference. This is a trough year for us and as you'll see from the mild result we would generate approximately $3.5 billion to over $5 billion in EBITDA in 2020 at prices ranging from $2.75 to $3.25. And this grows to $6.5 billion to $8.5 billion in EBITDA for 2021 and 2022 average. So you see that our EBITDA is moving from $3.5 billion to $5 billion next year to $6.5 billion to $8.5 billion depending on prices. These added volumes that we're bringing in are expected to come at a low incremental cost and that provides us with solid margin expansion even at low prices, and as we've been emphasizing it's about execution and over the next few quarters achieving our key milestones will continue to derisk the plan. The story is the same for operating cash flows where we're expanding operating cash flow over the next few years and that's net of our cash taxes and interest costs presented on the slide. Our cash flows grow from less than $2 billion this year in 2019 and would range from $2.5 billion to $3.7 billion in 2020 as we continue the transition. Of the average of 2021 and 2022 looking at $3 copper, it would range from over $5 billion to $6 billion at $3.25 copper for the average of 2021 and 2022. We show our capital expenditures in -- on slide 15 and these are broadly in line with our prior guidance. It includes sustaining capital of roughly $1 billion per year and then we've got the projects underway, including the underground at Grasberg and Lone Star that average about $1.6 billion per year in 2019 and 2020. As Richard mentioned, we're continuing to manage capital carefully and thoughtfully. The investments we're making now or at an advanced stage will strengthen our margins at low prices, enhance our long-term asset base and provide leverage to improve markets over time. These amounts do not include the new smelter in Indonesia in which FCX will share 49% of the economics. As indicated in the press release, we're completing engineering studies and we also have -- we're expecting to have the engineered estimates and project schedules in the first part of next year. We've been working with a group of banks on debt financing for the smelter. We expect to debt finance the capital cost of the smelter at the PT Freeport Indonesia level, and that is expected to be non-recourse to FCX. We are advancing the discussions with the banks and hope to have a facility in place to fund the cash outlays for the smelter. Currently, we do not expect the dividends out of PT-FI. We will be burdened by smelter development capital as a result during the construction period, and particularly, during the period prior to 2023, when FCX receives 81% of the dividends from PT-FI. Turning to slide 16, we show the debt maturity profile for our senior notes, which totaled $9 billion over this period of time. During the third quarter, we issued $1.2 billion in new eight and 10-year notes and those are shown in yellow on the graph. And we use the proceeds to redeem debt with near-term maturities and we also redeemed the higher coupon notes. We were able to extend our average maturity by a year. You can see here on the table where our weighted average maturity is roughly 10 years now, and we reduced our average coupon during this process. Our balance sheet's in good shape and we don't have significant maturities until 2022 and have a strong liquidity position. In closing, on slide 17, you see our road map to our growth in cash flows to drive shareholder value. Each of these initiatives is advancing well. The momentum that we have in each of these projects is real and we're very focused as a management team on executing these plans effectively and have a clear path in front of us to substantial growth in revenues, margins and free cash flow. Thanks for your attention, and Regina, we'll now open the call up for your questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Chris Terry : Hi, Richard and Kathleen. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one just relates to the grade reconciliation. So I was wondering if you could just talk firstly, on the gold for the full year? You've increased that. Is that just a timing issue or are you getting better reconciliation? And then, for the underground, you talked a lot about the development, but how is the grade -- how are the grades reconciling in copper and gold on the underground development? Thanks. Kathleen Quirk : With respect to the first question, the increase in gold for 2019 principally relates to the open-pit ore. We've extended the mining of open pit through November, and we're doing this on a limited basis, but it does have high grades. And so, it does impact us. There is a potential that we could extend the pit longer, but our real focus is on getting the underground ramp-up, which is going well. And we have not had any issues with respect to the grades. We've got good grades, higher than reserve grade coming from Deep MLZ in the early years, and that's part of what drives the metal production. But -- and Mark's on the line. Mark, I don't know if you have anything to add about the grades, but we believe we're in good shape on that front. Mark Johnson : Yeah, for all of the new major underground mines, Big Gossan, GBC and Deep MLZ, the grades that we've gotten are very much consistent with the reserves. In GBC and Deep MLZ, we're just really starting to touch the bottom of the columns and sampling through some of the drawbell period and some of the initial primary fragmentation is a bit challenging. We get a lot of big material, but everything we've seen so far is consistent with what we would expect. The ore bodies are very well drilled, like Richard had mentioned earlier. These are not new ore bodies. They are extension of ore bodies that we've been mining for years. So we haven't seen any issues there. Richard Adkerson : And for those of you who follow the Grasberg open pit for years, you will remember that we always had this high-grade core of gold. That's the way the mine was designed to access that, and that's why we're doing the surgical mining. When I was there, there was only two shovels working at the bottom of this pit. We mined out the haul road, so it's single-lane haul roads going down and coming up. But the reasons for doing that and trying to extend this is the ore, we are getting such high-grade gold. I mean it's extraordinary grade. And so that's the whole reason we're continuing to do it. We'll do it as long as we can, until the development of the Grasberg Block Cave pit. Eventually, well geotechnically, require us to get out and we've got procedures to get out very quickly, and we're monitoring with due diligence. But as long as we can get down to that high-grade gold, we're going to do it. And that's what you're seeing, Chris. Chris Terry : Okay, thanks -- thanks for the color on that. Second question, just on slide 17, when you are stepping through the future of the Company, I just wondered if you could comment, once you get through the ramp-up period of Grasberg and then have more decisions about future projects versus potential capital returns, can you just rank those? Are you trying to do both, is it one over the other? I just wondered if you could talk through what the priorities are for the medium-term investor? Thanks. Richard Adkerson : I can't wait till we face that. So here's what I think will unfold and it's going to depend on what the economics of the world are and so forth. But we will be generating cash and we will use that cash to manage our debt level on our balance sheet initially and return -- our balance sheet, we're comfortable with it. It's not a question of having to do things, but it will be sort of the situation we were in years past. We will be increasing returns to shareholders. Shareholders will have been patient, they deserve to be rewarded for that, and so we will be focused on the shareholder returns. With that, we've had a traditional emphasis on dividends, but we will be looking at share price and deciding about share buybacks and dividends. We will also be looking if markets warrant disciplined investments in some of these undeveloped resources of Freeport, which I think is a great asset for our Company. But in any event, if we pursue those and it will be disciplined, those in our industry are investments that are undertaken over time. It's not one-time investments. We have lots of people we'd like to be partners with us, and we'll make assessments of about that. So, my own view of how this will end up for all is success with the transition in these initiatives that we have, confident of that. I believe copper markets will be better, because I don't think today's price is sustainable and I think the world is geared for a brighter future. That will mean a lot of cash. We will use some of that probably to pay down some debt, shareholder returns and longer-term investments. Chris Terry : Okay. Thanks, Richard. The last one from me, maybe for Kathleen. Just on the timing of the sales versus the production, do you expect most of that to be caught up in 4Q or will you still have any imbalance that will head into 2020, if so, i.e. can we expect a really big catch-up in this quarter? Thanks. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. We are expecting that our inventories will be at normal levels. We do usually have some inventories at site, but generally, our production matches our sales. And in the fourth quarter, we expect to sell more than our production and get inventories back to normal. You always have from time-to-time some shipping, weather type things, but we're not expecting anything out of the ordinary and except most of that to be and it's reflected in our guidance, most of that to be sold in the fourth quarter. Chris Terry : Okay. Thanks. That's it from me. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Alex Hacking : Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. I just have one question. You mentioned in the slides there have been some seismic activity at DMLZ, that it's slowed some of the undercutting rates and so on. Obviously, underground mining is not necessarily as linear as open-pit mining and there are issues that crop up from time-to-time. So I guess, my question is, are you comfortable that there is enough production blocks, all at draw points, effectively sort of latency and optionality in that's been engineered into the DMLZ, so that if these geo -- as these geotechnical issues crop up over time, that you won't have significant impacts on production? Thanks. Richard Adkerson : Yeah. So, I've spent a lot of time talking with Mark and the team about this and asking that very question. And the more I get into it -- and I try to emphasize the point that this is multiple mines that we are developing in these mineralization areas with multiple headings. And I was making the comparison with open pit where when we first started open pit, we had a lot of access available because this pit was in high grade ore. But as we went further down in the pit, the pit widened and we had less options for dealing with changes in open-pit mining. And so in comparison, where we are at the underground, and Mark you jump in on this, but I'll give you my interpretation of meeting with you and your team. With these different mine headings that we have, is really going to give us a comfort that if we do have -- and it's not necessarily mining into seismic events, but you are going to have wet muck and other things that you encounter. We're dealing with that with remote mining activities and so forth. But because of these number of accesses that we have, we're going to be able to have confidence in being able to operate regularly and to deal with relatively predictable production now. You make a point there's risk in underground, that's true. But I want to make the point that we're not just talking about a single underground mine like we have with our smaller Big Gossan mine where an event could affect that. It is not material to overall operations, although it's a great profit generator. But with all these -- the large-scale of the ore bodies, the access to those ore bodies at multiple points, will give us the chance to avoid having the kind of risk that you would have if it was a single mine. Kathleen Quirk : And Alex, just to clarify, the slowing of the undercutting in one of the production blocks of Deep MLZ during the quarter was not -- was designed to achieve a desired cave shape. We're managing the seismicity issue. It wasn't related to that. It was simply to get the cave shape in a manner that we thought was the right shape and Mark can comment further on that. I just wanted to clarify that it wasn't a seismicity-driven issue. Mark Johnson : No, what was encouraging about this situation is that, that our team was able to detect a buildup of stored energy before we had any significant seismic event. They were able to determine what was -- what the cause of that was. We had a relatively flat cave angle. We focused on the mucking in this in the cave front area, and within a month we had the cave shape back where we'd like it. And then we were able to see that some of these indicators were back in line. And we had a process where we got back to the undercutting. So that to me was -- was all very encouraging. It was a very proactive way of looking at the data and adjusting the mining. Another -- just to comment on your concern about the underground mining. What we do in the underground mine plants that we have now, we use a central estimate where there is upside to the estimate. We also look at the downside events that could cause that. But what we try to do is to develop an estimate for our forecast that has 5% to 10% upside. And some of the advantages we're going to see in the underground, for instance, in the GBC where we have the manless automated train system is that we feel there may be some upside to our ability to maximize the use of our ore flow system that we haven't been able to do in the previous systems that were based on manned truck systems. This system will be able to run through shift changes, it will be much more of a continuous operation and also our mills will see a very consistent ore blend day to day. That's not necessarily been the case in the Grasberg Block Cave. We can confer the Grasberg pit. We can get into a very high-grade phase and then we can get into a low-grade phase and all those swings cause minor disruptions in the processing. I believe, once we get into a very steady state on the ore types and the feed grades, that there will be further enhancements to our ability to more efficiently process the material. Alex Hacking : Thank you. Thanks everyone. Very, very helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with B Riley FBR. Lucas Pipes : Hey, good morning everyone. Kathleen Quirk : Good morning. Lucas Pipes : I also wanted to -- I know this has come up a few times, but I also wanted to follow up on the DMLZ. And specifically, what I looked at was the number of drawbells by year-end 2019 and then also year-end 2020. Any long-term conclusions that can be drawn from this slight reduction? Just would appreciate that clarification. Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Mark, you want to take that? Mark Johnson : Yeah, we -- we had about three less drawbells than we planned for the quarter, which is around 3% of our total drawbells. We don't see that as significant, it didn't impact our ramp up. The amount of material that we pull from each draw point in the Deep MLZ is very conservative. When we had 80 drawbells in the DOZ, for instance, we were producing 30,000 tons a day. So we've been able to pull more per draw points. We continue to see that, that's an upside to where we are right now in our production ramp-up. We have not yet pulled any of the material that has been affected by the hydrofracking, that's just slightly above where we're pulling. So we're optimistic that, that hydrofracking will also affect the fragmentation as it starts to make its way to the draw point. So it didn't have any impact. It's a relatively minor change. We feel that our production schedules or tons per draw point are very much in line, in fact, well below what we experienced in the DOZ. Lucas Pipes : That's very helpful, I appreciate that. And then two quick follow-up questions. The first -- the 200 million pounds kind of efficiency-related output potential, when could that be coming through? I would appreciate a sense for the timing on that. And then secondly, you have a large portfolio of undeveloped assets. Could you speak to the extent those might be candidates for monetization would appreciate your thoughts. Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : We're just getting rolling out new plants in the first half of next year. With all of our teams are going through now new mine plans to incorporate the debottlenecking in the findings that we're experiencing through this program that Richard was talking about. And so our expectation is that beginning next year we will incorporate those plans and hope to have it in the first part of the year. In terms of the non-core asset sales, we'll continue to test the market and have dialog where we can add some cash proceeds to our Company at a time during this transition. We have a couple of assets that aren't producing cash flows that we may sell and that's just something we'll consider as we look at what the alternatives are. But that is something that we are -- that we do have. It's not in our plan. We do have a plan announced agreement to sell our refining -- part of the cobalt refining business in Kokkola and we expect that transaction to close in the fourth quarter. Richard Adkerson : And I'll just say we have substantial interest in the Serbian in the DRC asset, people and we're just assessing -- we understand the values and if we can get to those values we're likely to proceed with those, but there is interest in them. Lucas Pipes : That's very helpful. I appreciate all the color and continued best of luck. Richard Adkerson : Thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Chris LaFemina : Hi, thank you. Hi, Richard. Hi, Kathleen. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two different questions first relating to Grasberg and second, relating to the Americas. Actually I'd start with North America. So I think one thing that maybe gets a little bit lost in the mix with Freeport, because we're also focused on Indonesia, is very consistent and predictable operational track record in the Americas. In fact, especially in North America and third quarter was no exception, obviously you had very strong production there. I guess the question around that is unit costs in North America. I mean obviously not paying taxes, that's very helpful, but unit cost despite strong production in the quarter, creeped a little bit higher versus second quarter. How should we think about the cost progression in both North America and South America over a multiyear horizon? I mean obviously you have the innovation plans, which could lead to some cost reductions. But is the cost creep really just a function of grades? I mean it's -- or is there something else going on that you could -- that could make a material change lower over time? That's the first question. Kathleen Quirk : That's one of the real benefits of this program that Red is leading is over time, we've done a lot with low grade assets to maintain a competitive cost structure and these are new tools that are going to allow us to improve productivity and that will drop the unit cost. But one thing just to point out, we did have an increase year-over-year with North America. The biggest driver of that was at Morenci where the cash costs were higher year-over-year from an accounting standpoint. But when you look at the underlying cash, the amount of cash we spent to produce those pounds at Morenci in the quarter, it was actually the same as last year. But we had costs with these stockpiles that were inventoried on our balance sheet and because we drew, I mentioned we're getting better recoveries out of the leach pads we actually had some of those costs that were in inventory on our balance sheet come through the income statement and that's included in our, we call it, cash costs, but that's using the income statement. So really from a cash standpoint the way we also manage it is to exclude those prior period costs and when you look at it, the net cash costs were around -- were similar to the year-ago period. So -- but the real benefit as we are all talking is to drive those costs lower through productivity and not only do you have a lower unit cost, but that expands the reserve position because these North American assets are limited by economics, we use 250 to do our reserves. But if we can bring down the cash costs that's more reserves that could be brought in to the portfolio. So our focus is to keep stable and drive down the cost in the Americas. Richard Adkerson : And let me add one other fact that's been kind of part of our situation last couple of years. When we were so focused on debt reduction three years ago in 2016 and that was the time when copper prices were very low, we deferred some things and we've had to catch up with mine rates and that added some volume type cost to our business, which mostly is behind this now. I think one of the points we're making is we're not seeing significant increases in input cost. Energy costs are what they are, but our energy sources are diversified. The things that are keeping copper prices low are keeping some of our input costs low. So what you're seeing is some of these accounting type issues that Kathleen referred to, some degree of catch-up in employment, mine rates and so forth, but the fundamental cost structure of our business is not changing. We had the unusual -- you mentioned North America, South America this year had the unusual situation of having these disruptions of protests not related to Cerro Verde but related to other mines, but roads were blocked, we couldn't get equipment in, we had some delays in shipments, we had to take some steps to counter these disruptions that cost some money and that's just part of things that happen. The good news is the community continued to support our operations. So that's going to be normal variations. But every quarter right before this earnings call we sit down, we go through input cost with our supply team for all of our operations and I'm struck by just how well we are managing that suppliers or are being very responsive to us. Caterpillar is a big supplier of ours and we work well with them to reduce costs. So all of this is -- I guess the point I want to make is, there is not fundamental changes in the cost structure that are driving. Chris LaFemina : Thanks for that. And then quickly on Grasberg. There's a lot of focus amongst mining investors and our investors in general about ESG issues. Can you just kind of discuss the changes in the environmental impact at Grasberg as you move into the underground? We are moving less material, obviously making less waste. How do we think about the environmental impact from the operations going forward? Richard Adkerson : I should have mentioned this. I am so glad you asked this question. Besides being thrilled with what I saw with what we're doing with our underground transition, I spent a day taking helicopter tour over our tailings deposition area and then we got into buses and trucks and actually went down on the ground. There's two aspects to what you just said about waste management. One is the waste material we mined from the pit in placed around the mine. I went to this area called the Wannigen which is one of our major waste dumps where we've literally spent over the years $0.75 billion managing waste at that site. And again, I was there when it started and to see how effective that is in this way and mixing the waste rock with limestone to control the acid run-off, I mean it's remarkable, the numbers how they decreased. Then you get down the tailings area and this is a point I'm making with the government, I made with the President. This tailing system that we settled down in the mid-1990s was very controversial at the time, because we used a natural river to transport tailings and it was contained within a dike a levy system, within this designated deposition area. Today in that deposition area, we have a demonstration project of where we're actually growing crops, raising fish, raising cattle, and that's good. But what's more remarkable to me is, throughout this deposition area when the tailings -- when the tailings river moves away from the area, it dries up. A natural slime develops, natural grasses and trees are growing. And so in the tailings area, you can see over a majority of the area, natural re-vegetation occurring without any assistance from us. And our team estimates that at the conclusion of the mining decades from now, this whole area will return to a natural state and we will only have to do any kind of remediation for like 20% of the area. It's a visual verification of the decision that we and the government made 20 years ago, and that is that this was not only a cost-efficient way, but the proper way of disposing of these tailings, so that they can be restored. It was impossible to store tailings in the mountains, because of the severity of the terrain, the wetness of the climate and the -- although if not a higher earthquake area, the possibility of earthquakes. And so, we chose this system. And now 20 years later, with all that's going on, we can look back on it and say, this is working as designed and it was the right system. We're not defensive about it and the government is now agreeing with us. Chris LaFemina : Thank you for that. It's great. Richard Adkerson : And then you talked about ESG. We learned early on at Grasberg, for us to be successful, we had to work with the local people to be successful because of sensitivities between the province and the central government. Now under President Joko Widodo, there is more sensitivity about the central government improving the situation in Papua. And more of our taxes and royalties that we paid to central government are coming back to Papua. There will always be an issue with social situation there, but we are working hand-in-hand now. Now that our interest with the government are aligned, we are working hand-in-hand on improving the lives of local community. Freeport can't -- can't succeed unless Papua succeeds. We can't succeed unless Indonesia succeeds. The government now has a 70% ownership interest in the economics of this project. We have the same 30% we had going into all of these negotiations. But we are working cooperatively on security issues, community issues. There is an ongoing effort. But we are all working together now, and I met with local leaders when I was there and made the same commitment to them to keep working really 40% of our workforce today, our top ones whereas in 1996, it was just a handful. And one of the most exciting things, I have this picture of Kathleen standing with a group of women underground miners at the surface, operating remote control mining equipment underground at -- from the surface. And to see Papuan women, who came from the backgrounds that they came to, operating the largest underground mining operations ever in the history of this industry and not having to have big, strong men in harm's way underground with using equipment that looks like Game Boy, chairs and things and all the smiles and things, and seeing that, it's just -- it's really gratifying to see. Chris LaFemina : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Murphy with Barclays. Matthew Murphy : Hi. I had a few on just small changes on guidance on Grasberg, one being the CapEx. There is a mention in the release about the four-year period 2019 through 2022, where it looks like CapEx hiked a little bit. And then on slide 15 of the presentation, it doesn't look like Grasberg CapEx is up. So should we assume that 2021 and 2022 CapEx has gone up a bit, and if so, what's driving that? Kathleen Quirk : When we did the average in last quarter, it rounded. I mean this is a rounding thing, it rounded to $920 million something, and now it is $950 million round. So it's not -- it looks like a difference, but it's not a difference like what you would expect. But we did have some increases in 2021 and 2022 that were modest related to some mill improvements that we're reporting in. We had some revised engineering estimates on a new SAG that was included in some other minor changes. But they weren't -- the changes weren't significant. Matthew Murphy : Okay, and then just on 2021 gold, guidance came down a little bit. I get it's a small change. But I think you guys started the year at 1.6 million ounces and it's now 1.45 million ounces. I'm just wondering what -- do we expect to see that in 2022 and it's just a timing thing or is that ore body understanding or what? Richard Adkerson : Let me just say, these are Kathleen questions and she is going to answer them, but we at Freeport, we don't have an annual planning process. We update our plans every quarter. We step back and we meet and we come out with our best estimate. So there are going to be changes of this nature plus and minus, there are every quarter. But rather than like in my experience watching other companies, they give kind of constant guidance through the quarter and then they all have this big announcement how their plan and all these things come through. So those things you're seeing of this nature just reflect a bunch of hard work that goes in. And as you get closer to things, you get more specific planning done and the number change a bit. But... Kathleen Quirk : Yeah. And now just as Richard said, we do update the mine plans every quarter and we had a 25 million -- a 25,000 ounce change in gold in 2021, which could be grades or modest, small changes and that rounded the number differently. So as Richard said, we just -- we keep this update, and we don't want to have any big surprises to keep it updated each quarter. Matthew Murphy : Yeah, and I appreciate the disclosure. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Orest Wowkodaw : Hi, good morning. Just a follow-up on unit costs. Obviously, they bounce around quite a bit at Grasberg, depending on the volume, but if we looked at site delivery costs at Grasberg on a dollar basis, it seems to me that they've been trending up this year, averaging about $500 million a quarter or about $2 billion per annum. Is that a good guide for a run rate moving forward, because that's certainly up from what we've seen in the last couple of years that were more like $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion on for site delivery costs? I'm just curious if there is something going on this year with the transition that's driving that up and it will come back down or whether that's a good run rate from a dollar basis? Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Yeah. No, actually our costs at Grasberg, when you look at it on the basis that you're looking at, is lower this year and that reflects the lower mill rates than what we've had in recent years. But -- and then next year, we're not projecting any significant changes in the cost from this year. As you'll recall, a lot of it is fixed and then we do have some variable costs associated with the mill rate. But we've got basically a core team that manages the operation. We don't have -- we're not having significant changes in the costs and actually they are actually down from prior year. So we've been -- one of the things Mark's team is leading out there during this period of time of transition is really trying to drive efficiencies. Grasberg has always had high production and so costs have been less of a focus but his team out there is really focused on dropping aggregate costs and looking at cost and capital together. So we will be happy, Dave and I can call you and review exactly what your question was. But we see that Grasberg costs have been trending lower this year versus previous year. Orest Wowkodaw : Okay. I'm not sure I actually got, but... Richard Adkerson : On that issue when we're out there but Orest maybe you've got some elements of cost that you're raising the question about rather than the total cost. Orest Wowkodaw : Okay. Yeah, I just looking at your total site delivery cost of $1.5 billion year-to-date versus $1.4 billion last year at Grasberg. Kathleen Quirk : Yeah, last year total cost, cash production cost at PT-FI was $1.9 billion and we're less than $1.8 billion this year. Orest Wowkodaw : Okay. Maybe we will take it offline. Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Okay. Richard Adkerson : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. John Tumazos : Thank you. Well, the 40 million pounds decline at Cerro Verde in the third quarter, we caught up and would there be 40 million extra pounds delivered in the fourth quarter with blockade of another party being over or were there a few other operational items that might have gotten mixed in and contributed to the decline in addition? And separately could you give us a flavor of the day-to-day productivity and cost issues you manage? My sense is that you're going to do your best to have a net profit for the year rather than a small loss. And could you talk about whether it's day to day cost per ton, day to day recovery rates, travel expense, exploration expense, bypassing some low-grade areas, maintenance schedules, some stripping that you can postpone, the different things you're trying to do, it's impressive, if you can stay out of the red as the price falls. Richard Adkerson : So I'm going to ask Red to talk about situation at Cerro Verde. I mean, practically we try to operate all out, and that's our plan. So there is not really capability of makeup, although there was some inventory that's in our numbers that we will make up. But John, we certainly aim to maximize cash flows. That's what we're doing, but we are not driven, I talked about the strategy of our Company and the major initiatives that we are on and that's what we're focused on. We are not -- we're trying to be efficient every day and cut out unnecessary cost. But in terms of trying to do things that would otherwise be beneficial in deferring them, just so we can affect near term accounting profits is not what we're back up and the bigger picture is this thing is irrelevant to the future of our Company. Now, I don't want you to think we're not being hard nose on expenses and efficiencies that we are. But to defer some maintenance that could have longer-term consequences just to achieve some near-term results, we're not going to do that. Red, why don't you talk about the Cerro Verde situation? Red Conger : Yeah, John just quickly going from the issues that Kathleen discussed in the third quarter that we faced. There is going to be some carryover effect from that into the fourth quarter. Our mining lines did not get advanced to the areas that we thought we would in the fourth quarter. So we're going to have to use some additional low grade stockpile material to offset that timing of ore. That ore material is there. It's not lost and will be mined next year. So we've got a small effect in the fourth quarter from that. Kathleen Quirk : But both production and sales for Cerro Verde are expected to be higher compared to the third quarter for the fourth quarter. Red Conger : Yeah. I was just referring to our forecast. Kathleen Quirk : Yeah. But compared -- as Red said, compared to the prior forecast we did adjust some Cerro Verde for the current mining situation there. But on a quarter-to-quarter basis sequentially production and sales we're expecting to be higher than the third quarter at Cerro Verde. Richard Adkerson : And in along the lines of what you talking about. John, one of the things we talked about with Mark and his team who is out there is as we are ramping down mining from the open pit, there is going to be a lot of dismantling of facilities, transfers of equipment we're transferring trucks from Indonesia to North America and the Cerro Verde and so we talked about having a focused team on how to -- and as we are -- the focus of the overall organization is on this underground transitions to put together team of how we can do things like that as efficiently and saving cost in doing some of the less significant, less visible items in an economical way. But you look back at our, for example, our G&A cost, we've made substantial reduction of G&A costs in recent years on the order of 30%-plus percent, right, Kathleen? And so we are continually going through our organization and challenging personnel cost, travel cost and the things of that nature. John Tumazos : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Timna Tanners : Hey guys, good morning. Just one question from me that I didn't hear anyone asking and I really wanted to get your high-level thoughts on. It seems like there is an uptick in disruptions in Chile lately and some maybe project specific issues in Peru. I just wanted to get your thoughts on is this isolated incident, is this something broader that we should be worried about is country risk picking up in those Latin American regions? Thanks. Richard Adkerson : So Peru has been a country of where there's been this dichotomy between the government through several presidential administrations since I've been involved there over the past 12 years. There has been consistent recognition by the government for the way for Peru to improve is encourage mining investment and the Central Government has done that directly with us and other miners. They have seen the historical success in Chile and they made a lot of progress. The challenge in Peru has been and this is not new, but it's been all along, the conflict between local communities and nearby mine developments, often centered around access to water. But also disruptions in communities and so forth. And this has been a feature of business in Peru, which still and even though the country has made tremendous progress, still has a large income disparity within the country. And so it's something that we recognized at Cerro Verde early on and I was just with the President of Peru. I've been with other Presidents and they all acknowledge that we've been a shining star of success with community relations in our region with the city of Arequipa where we provided fresh water system as a community support, we developed this innovative use of a wastewater treatment center to get water for our expansion rather than building new dam, improve the river, improve the farmer situation. But there is ongoing issues related to other mining projects in Peru and it's sort of this inherent conflict between communities and mines and that's been a feature and is likely to continue to be a feature going forward. Although the current President, as I discussed with him, is very committed to encouraging mine development and wanting to do things to help it, but it's an ongoing social problem. Chile is a country that over the years has had a stable situation. There are labor issues that come about with labor negotiations that cause disruptions from time-to-time. And there've been, in certain parts of the country, weather events and earthquake events, but typically, the civil situation has been relatively stable. On occasion there gets to be a debate between the use of revenues generated by mining for different purposes within government. And that's one back -- current situation, we have one or two that you talked about what we're seeing. Red Conger : Yeah. Part of the reason that's such a surprise to the world is that Chile has been our country steeped in rule of law. Things work very well there and are very reliable. And over time, there has been this concern about incoming quality and how people can better themselves, can they grow the economy fast enough to create jobs for all of the well-educated people. So, just a recent event of changing the prices of the metro fare by a relatively small amount, had sparked this current unrest. President Pinera has pulled everybody together, gave a great talk last night to the country about how they recognize these issues and are going to redouble their efforts to address it. So it sounds like they are resolving this current unrest and everybody that we've talked to this morning, feels very positive about the efforts being made going forward. Richard Adkerson : But, Timna as I reflect on your question, let me step back and look at a -- the global situation. You're raising issues about country risk, and I think unquestionably, that's a feature in today's world and recent history. And it's something that ultimately is very supportive of copper prices and supply development. And you just go around the world and look at what situations have occurred. The situation in Alaska with a new mine that's been proposed there. The situation in Mongolia, our situation in Indonesia. We talked about, Peru, Chile has been really a stable situation. Situation in Africa where we were, and in 2008, our contract was challenged and now the new mining law has being revised, but that's beyond the DRC into Zambia and other places. Even here in Arizona, where we have just remarkably positive relationships with the government, the communities where we operate and that's taken years of work, we have -- I tip my hat to Red and his team for the positive relationships we have with the native American groups where we need to have positive relationship for water access, but we are providing training and employment opportunities for their people. But there mines here in Arizona that are very controversial right now. I won't go out and say specific mines, because I don't like to talk about other countries, but you're fully aware of the challenges that people face. And so mining is challenging, because it has such a major impact on communities where mines are located. There's issues about sustainability of mining, the resource curse question, the issue of environmental impacts, the competition for water, it's just in here. We are working on those issues through ICMM. But the reality is, is that's a major constraint on future mine development in an industry where the economic resource is scarce. Copper is not like iron ore or coal, it's not everywhere. And the easy copper deposits have been found over the years, modern deposits at the surface are much lower grades. Like our Cerro Verde mine, it requires tremendous investments in infrastructure mining. Processing, we have the largest mill facilities in the world at Cerro Verde. Enormous tailing dams are required, because you process so much material. And increasingly, mines are underground where costs are greater. So all of that is reality. Everybody is working to try to deal with it, but it is ultimately a very positive impact for future copper prices. Timna Tanners : Okay. I appreciate that overview. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jatinder Goel with Exane BNP Paribas. Jatinder Goel : Hi, good afternoon. Just a couple of small questions. I understand these are not material numbers, but just curious on -- your treatment charges for Indonesia have gone up by $0.02 on 2019 guidance. Is there a change in concentrate grade or is there any interim revision in the terms similar rise in royalty and export duties? I understand gold price and volumes are higher, but at the same time, the copper price is lower. Is it just the mix or something else is changing there as well? Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Right. It is the mix and we are exporting more than what we had in our previous plan, but it's really just a mix issue and not something more than that. Jatinder Goel : Okay. Very clear. Richard Adkerson : We get -- we pay global TCs and RCs. I mean, it's market based with the world's largest marketer of copper concentrate and the concentrate price that we pay is the globally negotiated rates. Jatinder Goel : Sure, thank you. Richard Adkerson : We agree on a royalty stream with the government and that's what we pay. Jatinder Goel : Okay, very clear. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera with CIBC. Oscar Cabrera : Thank you, operator and good morning, everyone. Everyone there, first of all, congratulations on the strong development of Grasberg. We look forward to see how that transition will excel. Just getting back to South America and Cerro Verde, are you assuming that the blockades won't be there for your budget in the fourth quarter and into next year? Kathleen Quirk : With -- Repeat that after... Richard Adkerson : He's saying of the blockades with -- they are down now, right Red? Red Conger : Yeah and we're assuming that things run as\u2026 Richard Adkerson : No, now some of the issues that led to the blockade are still unresolved. And so, you know if something else happens it happens, but we don't predict that. We -- our plans are based on having normal access to our port for delivering concentrate, normal access for bringing goods into the -- to the operation and for our people to be able to come to work. So... Kathleen Quirk : And that's the case today. Richard Adkerson : And that is the case as we speak. Oscar Cabrera : Okay. Yeah, now that was the question. Thanks very much. Then secondly, Richard Adkerson : And I will say this -- I will say this Oscar. Not all of the disruptions that you read about affect us, okay. This one did, but there have been other disruptions for other mines that did not affect us, but this one was particularly well organized and it was directed to disrupt us as a protest against other operations -- as well as the other operations. Oscar Cabrera : Yeah, no, I think that is well understood by the market, which is the unfortunate position of just having to use the same route to get your product back to market. Then secondly, on Chile, there was -- can you just please remind me, one other large mining company cut back their projection for copper production because of the drought that they're experiencing in the South. But can you please remind me your situation in as far as water and power in El Abra? Red Conger : Yeah. So the water at El Abra comes from well fields up near the border with Bolivia. So it -- those well fields are well managed, that are sustainable and no issues for us. Kathleen Quirk : And this is a leach operation, not the -- not a mill. When we are talking about a potential there -- El Abra expansion, we would address water there with a desalinization. But the current operation doesn't require that. Richard Adkerson : And you know, somebody asked earlier about future development projects. El Abra is a very attractive project that -- where we're partners with Codelco. It would be a mill expansion. It would require, as Kathleen said, desal and it would be subject to Chilean taxes. We have a number of projects in the US that we're considering as an expansion at our Bagdad mine in Arizona. That is not as large scale, but we own 100% of the mine, we own the land at fee. We have no income taxes to pay in the US. We have expansion opportunities at a number of our other US mines, including Morenci. We have a potential expansion opportunity in New Mexico. So we have a number of alternatives. What we're doing right now as we speak is, we are doing studies of these. We are advancing our understanding of the projects, the ore bodies with challenging capital. We're trying to come up to see which ones are most economic and we are ranking them so that when we do get to the promised land of strong cash flows, and pay and returns to shareholders, we will be able to evaluate which of these to pursue on a disciplined basis but -- I failed to answer your other question, I just wanted to make this comment. Oscar Cabrera : No. We appreciate that, Rich. And we look forward to not turnaround in a couple markets, and then congratulations again on the Grasberg success. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, Oscar. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Michael Dudas : Thanks everybody for squeezing me in. Richard, what do you and your team expect to see when you get to LME Week? Richard Adkerson : Man, I'd say that's -- we're there next week as you know, Mike, and every year it's a good barometer for what's going on in the industry. My guess is, we'll hear a lot of complaining about US government's trade policy. We will hear talk about China's efforts to bolster its economy through fiscal means and through economic stimulus, and spending on infrastructure and Belt and Road Initiatives. I'm sure we'll hear a lot of talk about Timna's question about government relations and dealing with governments with -- actually meeting will be focused on dealing with tailing down management, which is an issue we have long recognized as important for Freeport. At the time of the Phelps Dodge deal, we put immense focus on it and we've invested a lot in it, continue to and our -- the situations that evolve around the world are matters everyone is studying and working with others in the industry to review our practices. But we are confident we're doing the right thing and we'll always do the right thing. So, that's kind of an overview of what I expect. It's -- as you know like it's mood swing to come over LME and sometimes it's positive, sometimes it's hopeful and sometimes it's negative. And it's not always predictable in advance. Michael Dudas : Well, you'll be running into the Brexit issue over there, so good luck when that happens. Thanks, Richard. Richard Adkerson : Yeah. I don't even know what to say about that, and so I won't say anything. Operator : I will now turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Kathleen Quirk : Well, thanks everyone for your participation and we look forward to ongoing reporting of our progress. If you have any follow-ups, feel free to call David Joint. Thanks so much. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that concludes our call for today. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, and welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning and a copy of the press release and slides for today's call are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. We\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the Risk Factors described in our Form 10-K. Also, on the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, Red Conger, Mark Johnson and Mike Kendrick. I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results and then will turn the call over to Richard who will review our recent performance and outlook. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for questions. Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $9 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. After adjusting for net charges of $22 million or $0.02 per share, which primarily reflected net charges at PT-FI, mostly related to historical contested tax audits, metals inventory adjustments and partly offset by gains on asset sales, the adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $31 million or $0.02 a share in the fourth quarter of 2019. For details about the special charges, please refer to schedule VII, Roman numeral seven in our press release. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter, EBITDA totaled $891 million. We also have a reconciliation of EBITDA available on page 35 of the presentation materials. Fourth quarter copper sales totaled 906 million pounds. Those were higher than our October estimate of 870 million pounds. And gold sales of 317,000 ounces in the fourth quarter were 117,000 ounces higher than our October estimate of 200,000 ounces. The positive variance to guidance of our copper and gold was primarily associated with an expansion of mining from the Grasberg open pit, which was completed in the fourth quarter and also the timing of shipments as we sold some inventory from the third quarter. Our average realized price in the fourth quarter was $2.74 per pound that was similar to the year-ago of average copper price, and gold prices of $1,491 average for the quarter were slightly above last year's fourth quarter. Our consolidated average unit net cash cost, net of byproduct credits was $1.67 per pound of copper in the fourth quarter of 2019. Those were lower than our estimate, primarily reflecting the higher copper and gold sales volumes in the quarter. Operating cash flows during the fourth quarter totaled $170 million. That was net of $250 million tax payment related to contested tax audits in Indonesia. And capital expenditures were about $700 million during the quarter, including about $400 million for major projects. During the quarter, we generated $450 million in proceeds from asset sales associated with the previously announced completion of the sale of a portion of our interest in Freeport Cobalt and also a sale of our lower zone interest in expiration project in Serbia. We ended the year with consolidated debt of $9.8 billion and consolidated cash totaled $2 billion. We had no borrowings and $3.5 billion available under our revolving credit facility. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Richard who will be referring to our slide presentation materials. Richard Adkerson : Thank you, Kathleen, and good morning, and thank each of you for participating in today's call. We at Freeport had an excellent fourth quarter, doing what we set out to do. During this period of time, execution is our battle call, and that's exactly what we did. We executed. We have strong momentum on three important initiatives to expand margins and cash flows and increase values for shareholders. Looking back on the year 2019, we set a strong foundation for the long term and positioned our Company for profitable growth for years to come. We start with the first and most impactful initiatives, and that is our underground ramp-up at Grasberg, which I'm pleased to report is accelerating as planned. During the fourth quarter, we completed surface mining at the Grasberg open pit. And now, we are entirely focused on establishing large-scale production from our massive low-cost and long-lived underground ore bodies. And that's going to be a source for significant cash flows for 20-plus years to come. We benefit from the substantial development and infrastructure that is already being completed. The strength of our team which possesses necessary technical competences, experiences and motivation to successfully execute our plan, and that's what they're doing. Positive production results in 2019 is enhancing our previously existing confidence of our ramp-up schedule. And we\u2019ve talked before, we're in a show me stage for ourselves and for our investors, and that's what we've done. We're showing people that we're doing what we said out to do. The designs of the Grasberg Block Cave and the Deep MLZ mine are world class. We are using our mining experience that we've had over our 40-year history of underground mining to enhance infrastructure construction. We're using new technology autonomous loaders and remote control equipment. We've made advances in ground support techniques, undercut blasting and cave management. And we're going to continue to take advantage of these improved technologies as we go forward. Technology advances in underground mining are more impactful and more achievable than open pit mining, simply because the nature of the processes. We were successful in meeting or exceeding important milestones during the year, and I'll review that in more detail in a moment. Second initiative is the commissioning of a new mine in Arizona Lone Star. We will be commencing production in this year, in 2020. Project is on track, about 75% complete, within budget. We have great experiences and track record and working in Arizona. Notably, we have the support of the communities near this mine. And that's important when you look at the issues people face in Arizona and around the world in developing new mines. The economics of this investment are really attractive, provide a source of long-term cash flow with low-risk growth opportunities. Exploration of this ore-body continues to be positive, both with respect to an expanding oxide resource and as we look into the future with a very large sulfide resource, which has a potential of making this a keystone mine of tier one asset in the global mining industry. The third value driver relates to our innovation program, really focusing on enhancing productivity, expanding markets without spending a lot of capital. During 2019, we took our experience that we had working with our Bagdad mine and initiated a series of projects throughout our American portfolio mines using new technology, machine learning, more data-driven, interactive and cross-functional operating structure, bringing all of our skills in those areas within our Company together. Our experiences demonstrate these tools allow us to work our existing assets harder, unlock bottlenecks and improve overall performance. Early results are positive. We're prioritizing initiatives now to implement these on the larger scale. We have begun to incorporate these initiatives, these projects into our plans, and currently are expecting to achieve 200 million pounds of annual production -- incremental production by 2022, emphasizing, again with very low capital. Each of these three initiatives are well-advanced, they're all largely with our own control and provide a clear path for high cash flows, value creation.  Slide four. With all the talk about ESG, we have reiterated our commitment to all of our stakeholders. For us, this starts with a strong culture of safety at all levels of our organizations. That's the core of everything we do. We operate in a dangerous industry with challenging physical environments. And we are really diligent in developing tools to enhance safety performance, with particularly emphasis on fatality prevention and continuous improvement. We recognize and appreciate the performance of our global workforce who are integral to our success. We pay people fairly in compensation and benefits. We provide career opportunities for people to grow in their work and to support the families. And it's a big part of what we do. Freeport has a long history of partnering with communities where we operate to ensure that the work that we do results in a positive impact on communities with regard to their health, welfare and sustainability. And we continue to work to do this and it\u2019s important feature of what we do. Environmental protection programs are also key to us, and we dedicate significant human and financial resources to addressing this. Our management programs are designed to mitigate impacts and closely monitor performance. We have a particular focus on water conservation. Water is an issue in most mines that we have. We are increasing sourcing of low carbon and renewable energy and have a track record of world class remediation programs. We are taking a very active role in working within ICMM and key stakeholders on developing a new global standard for tailings management. We have enhanced our disclosures in this area, so that all stakeholders have access to our tailings management activities and how we're dealing with this important area of our business. Freeport, we are leading and important producer of copper in the global industry. This is fundamental as the world transitions to a low-carbon economy. Copper is a key driver in mitigating carbon emissions through the application of renewable energy technologies and is a net positive for the future economy. Our commitment to sustainable and responsible mining is not new. This focus on communities, workers and environment is something that's been part of our culture for years. We recognized long ago, this is essential to the longstanding sustainability of our industry and that we cannot be successful in generating value for shareholders, unless we address these issues effectively and we are committed to doing that. Slide five talks about copper markets. Big picture, fundamentals are strongly supported for the future, and our Company's going to be a beneficiary of those strong fundamentals. When we look back on 2019 with slowing global growth, with the impact on -- within China, within the U.S. with the weakened performance of the manufacturing sector, with the issues in Europe, it\u2019s striking that copper inventories are at low levels that they are today. Supply growth continues to be relatively low. Markets can be expected to be tight in the future -- be become tight in the future. Copper will benefit under a scenario of even modest global growth, and the added benefit of increasing use of copper to implement decarbonization trends is a feature, this will be part of the long-term future of our industry. The current price today has improved from the 2019 lows, but is still well below the incented price needed to attract new supply. Slide six, we address returning again to talking about our strategy, the impact of that. As I\u2019ve said often, we are laser focused on execution of this strategy, and that's what we're all about. We\u2019ve worked for years now in planning and developing, particularly at Grasberg the transition to the underground and now we are executing this very efficiently, as you can see by the numbers we reported today. We have a growing production and cash flow profile that's going to be very significant and will benefit our shareholders in years to come. We're well-advanced on this underground transition. Results to-date are on target. We're moving closer to 2021 when we start seeing the results of this work that we've been doing over the past 15-plus years, and then beyond that, how we will be able to benefit from these investments and this work that we're doing. Through the execution of the ramp-up at Grasberg, the commissioning of the Lone Star project, ongoing productivities in our Americas operations, we expect to increase our copper and gold sales volumes by over 30% in 2021, compared with just completed 2019 trough year. This will result in a 25% reduction in net unit costs, all things being equal, and more than double our EBITDA and cash flows at current commodity prices. I personally believe, there's a potential for higher prices. With a growing production profile at a time when copper markets may be rising, our shareholders would have exposure to a positive long-term future, and Freeport will be particularly well situated as it faces that future. Much of the capital investment we need to achieve this result has already been made, and achievement of our targets continue to reduce the risk that this plan had embedded in it. These are long-lived assets with a strong base for solid cash flows for the future. Slide seven. We show a summary comparing historical and future results for Grasberg. The Grasberg district in Indonesian Papua where we have operated since early 1970s, is one of the world's largest and most valuable mining districts historically, very large copper producer, but with the significant byproduct gold component is one of the world's largest gold deposits. Grasberg has delivered cash flows over the last 30 years. We expect even more cash flow in the future and it\u2019s truly, truly a remarkable asset. And that's why we\u2019ve had such a focus in maintaining and developing our rights and working with the government of Indonesia to secure that. We\u2019ve had a year now since we achieved the new structure and it\u2019s working very effectively. A picture at the top left is a picture of the open pit in December. We have now completed mining from the surface. So, the pit is no longer being mined and is quite a remarkable picture. Mark and his team did a great job in extending the life of the pit. We had to do this in a conscious way because of the future interaction of the block cave mining underneath the pit, same ore-body, just to be mined from the surface. And we had to make sure that we did not expose our people or the ore-body to risk when this interaction -- as this interaction begins to occur. We did this safely. We did -- were able to produce longer than we anticipated going into the -- in the beginning of the year. And then stepping back at this, I look at this picture. I have a picture in my office of the Grasberg pit every year since it started production, and it starts with a snapshot that I took in 1988 at the exploration site, and then to see this pit completed. Since 1990, PT-FI produced 33 billion pounds of copper, 53 million ounces of gold from the Grasberg district, generated $100 billion in gross revenues. During this period of time, we moved 5 billion tons of material, both ore and waste to process about 1.8 billion tons of ore. As I said, we're now totally focused on establishing large scale production from underground. And we're a leader, have been for years in block cave mining, decades of experience dating back to the early 1980s of PT-FI. The Grasberg Block Cave, which represents about 50% of our underground reserves, is the same -- very same ore-body, mine from the pit, but the block cave method will allow us to mine more profitably than continuing from our surface. In block cave, the ore collapses under gravity, there's no stripping or mine waste. As we show in our slide, we only have to mine one-third of the material that we had to mine historically and produce more copper into underground era. Mining 1.8 billion tons of ore will be lower costs than mining 5.2 billion tons of ore. The gross revenues associated with these reserves to be produced over the next 20 years or so at $3 copper and $1,500 gold would approximate $150 billion, approximately 50% more than we produced over the last 30 years. Developing the infrastructure for the scale of operations was our biggest challenge. We've essentially done that and we still have to add -- we're building some additional crushers, some additional power, we'll make some mill modifications. But, the infrastructure has been done. Now, we're mining and the mining will be in different phases. This is not just one mine or two mines, and it's of a scale that's consistent with what we've done in the past. We have met the biggest challenges of doing this, and now we're just doing what we've done in the past essentially. Our reserves are reported only through 2041, which is the termination date of our existing agreement with the government. The resource goes beyond that. And I would -- and I expect that Freeport will continue to be involved beyond 2041. So, with the block caving, we had this multiyear investment period that began in 2003, more than two thirds of the underground development meters of our largest mines have been achieved. We invested in infrastructures, state of art, autonomous underground rail system. Most of the capital cost for the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ are behind us. Slide eight shows the underground milestones we achieved in 2019. Fourth quarter combined ore production from the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ was higher than our forecast, it\u2019s averaging 26,000 tons per day for the quarter. We exited 2019 at combined rate of 33,000 tons a day. Quarterly rates for Grasberg Block Cave included a 20-day outage for a planned modification of our ore flow system. We continue to add new drawbells, which is the structural features that allow us to extract the ore and mine it. These are rock funnels used to collect the ore, which goes in the loaders as the ore collapses from the structure above it. We continue to add drawbells across the footprint. We will build scale for higher production. We added some new schematics and the reference information in the back of the presentation, so you can review what we completed to-date and what we plan to do in 2020. In the fourth quarter, we added 34 new drawbells at the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ, compared to 14 in the first quarter of 2019. We expect to continue adding drawbells over 2020 to average 48 a quarter. Cave propagation for the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ continues to go very well. The Grasberg Block Cave will be the largest contributor to copper and gold production following the ramp-up. Reserves total about 1 billion pounds of high-grade copper and gold -- billion tons. Grasberg Block Cave will have a very large footprint, 80 acres, at full rate, 180 cares over the life of the mine. The size of the ore-body gives us the ability to produce simultaneously from five production blocks, five production blocks, not just a single mine, given the scale, flexibility and assurance that we can have continuous production. So, in substance, we have multiple mines underground, sharing the same infrastructure. We know the rock types from mining the same ore for the past 30 years with extensive drilling that we've done. We are assessing ore about 300 meters below the pit bottom in the Grasberg Block Cave. As we continue undercutting and adding draw points, the cave expansion at the Grasberg Block Cave will ramp up to 130,000 tons per day from these different cave fronts at the Grasberg Block Cave by 2023. The Deep MLZ is a different mineralization zone, where we are using hydraulic fracking, which has been very effective in managing the seismicity issues we talked about previously. We're continuing undercutting the Deep MLZ drawbell openings. We will have two active production blocks in the near term there, three in the longer term. In the early years, the grades in the Deep MLZ are very high. Fourth quarter grades at Deep MLZ were 1.7% copper and over 1.7 grams per ton of gold. At full rates, production from these two ore-bodies is projected to average over 1.3 billion pounds of copper, 1.3 million ounces of gold and that\u2019s sustainable at very high levels over the long term. Earlier years\u2019 high grades will enhance production, average net unit cash costs are expected to average about $0.30 a pound in the first five years at full rate. It is really notable and rare for large-scale operations in our industry. The key for us now to continue our undercutting to expand the footprint to open up new areas for drawbells and ore production, we expect to increase the number of drawbells in 2020 as work areas expand. Again, this is doing things at a scale that we've done in the past. Infrastructure is essentially in place. And now, we're just executing mining, like we\u2019ve done. There is risk in mining projects, there will be pluses and minuses as we go forward. But we felt that we\u2019ve now dealt with the major structural risk that we face going into this, and we\u2019re real positive about our results to-date and our ability to manage risk as we go forward. Slide nine shows an update on the Lone Star project in Arizona. Commissioned as a new mine in this year in 2020. See from the pictures, the mine is taking shape, ramping up placement of ore on the leach pad at the nearby Safford operations where we have available facilities to process this ore without major new capital expenditures. The current project is forecast to add $200 million pounds of copper per annum initially, and we have opportunities to increase production with low capital requirements. We're continuing to -- as I mentioned, to analyze the positive exploration data that just keeps coming at us, this ore-body and incorporating in our future plan, very positive about the upside to build scale on what could come, a significant cornerstone asset for us in the United States, in Arizona over time where have no royalties because we own the land, we have virtually no taxes because of our situation, a lot of value. Slide 10. This innovation initiative is really taking shape. Over the last several months, we developed a blueprint for our operating sites to implement these new data-driven technology tool, provide operator training, redesign our operating teams to incorporate cross-functional disciplines, bringing in our people on site with data analysts and outside experts to achieve what we can achieve. The availability of these new technologies is truly changing the way we work. We're challenging the status quo, not accepting what we did in the past. It\u2019s giving us the ability to adjust quickly to maximize productivity. We're leveraging these data analytics and collaborating a cross-function, arming our operators with tools, empowering them to make decisions quickly using real-time data, bottlenecks are being broken down and results are being measured in real time to really determine and improve productivity. This slide talks about two of these initiatives, one for our concentrating plants and one for our mining operations. We\u2019re developing algorithms in the concentrating plants, which really takes hundreds of thousands of data points on ore types, metallurgy and other operating conditions to make recommendations in real time, designed to maximize copper production. These models, which we call TROI, an acronym, are tailored to each side based on the characteristics of the ore-body and the processing equipment environment that we have. In the mine, we're developing technology to aggregate data from multiple existing systems to provide dispatch personnel with real-time information and recommendations to eliminate downtime, optimize movement of material to achieve the highest level of productivity at given work shift and to maximize the nature of the ore that we have in mine. Energy around this initiative within our team continues to build. I was just with our global team last week, and it's really gratifying to see how they're embracing this initiative. Organization\u2019s really gotten behind it. We had really positive results at our Bagdad mine in Northwest Arizona, where we in effect field tested this, it reach. At Bagdad, we achieved the 15% increase in output, lower unit cost and other benefits. We\u2019re prioritizing projects in the process of implementing them. We have included at this point in our plans adding 200 million pounds of copper from these initiatives, beginning in 2022. Our team keeps expressing confidence that we can do better than that. And so, we're looking forward to reporting you how that works, to lower average and capital costs. Costs are relatively low, in the range of $200 million to implement these things. It's highly attractive considering that a new project that add 200 million pounds of copper would involve capital in the range of a $1.5 billion to $2 billion and take much longer to implement. Kathleen is going to cover our financial outlook. And I\u2019d just close by highlighting he key value drivers to characterize Freeport as foremost in the global copper industry. We start with the valuable portfolio of high quality assets, tier 1 assets with scale supported by exceptional technical team and managed efficiently responsibly. We operate all the mines that we have interest in. And that gives us a powerful ability to lever experiences, allocate resources, people and deal with supply chain issues. Our assets are long lived, durable, and have embedded options for growth. We are an industry leader in copper, which is supported as a commodity by strong fundamentals. We have a growing production profile and cash flow profile of significance. And you'll see this clearly in the slides that Kathleen will talk about. Right now, we're focused on executing these three initiatives. We will have a future that will give us an opportunity to consider a number of alternatives as we go forward, including investing in a disciplined way on growing our undeveloped resources. Collectively, these positive attributes provide us with strong financial outlook and fundamental value. We're gaining real momentum, I think as you can see by the data we're reporting today to achieve our objectives. And we repeat again, we're clearly focused on executing our plans in an effective way. We now have a clear path of generating a meaningful increase, revenues, earnings and cash flow. And I personally look forward to reporting to you on our ongoing progress. Thank you. Kathleen? Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, Richard. And I'm going to start on slide 13 and take you through how all these initiatives translate into improving cash flow and value for our shareholders. We summarized on slide 13 our consolidated sales outlook for the period 2020 through 2022. And you can see here the 30% growth in copper sales between 2019 and 2021 that Richard referred to previously. This equates to an increase of about 1 billion pounds of copper, which results in incremental revenues, totaling $2.8 billion at today's copper price. The growth volumes that are coming in -- the growth volumes that are coming in are at a very-low incremental cost, which result in a sizable increase in our EBITDA and cash flows, as you will see modeled, in a moment. For 2020, we're projecting 3.5 billion pounds of copper sales, that's in line with our previous estimates. The increase of 200 million pounds between 2019 and 2020 primarily reflects increases in North America and Indonesia, partly offset by lower grades of South America. In 2021, we're projecting sales of 4.3 billion pounds of copper as output in Indonesia returns to more historical levels. And we\u2019ve also included a projected benefit of an incremental 100 million pounds of copper in 2021 and 200 million pounds of copper in 2022 associated with the Americas innovation and productivity initiatives that Red is leading and Richard talked about a few minutes ago. We show 2022 volumes growing to 4.6 billion pounds of copper. For gold, we also expect sales to rise as we ramp up the underground at Grasberg. As we talk about our sales in 2019, exceeded -- our gold sales exceeded our forecast and in the fourth quarter were about 100,000 ounces higher than what we expected going into the quarter. For the outlook, we made some model revisions in our latest forecast. But the estimates are pretty close to our previous estimates with gold volume forecasted 800,000 ounces in 2020, growing to 1.4 million ounces in 2021 and 1.7 million ounces in 2020. Sales of molybdenum are expected to be in the 90 million pound range as we go forward. But, we do have additional capacity that we can produce if conditions warrant. Moving to the next slide. On slide 14 we show our projected 2020 volumes by quarter for your reference. With the underground ramp-up at Grasberg, the sales are expected to increase throughout the year. And by the fourth quarter, you\u2019ll see we expect to be at an annual run rate, approaching 4 billion pounds, which is well on our way to the 4.3 billion pounds target that we expect to achieve in 2021. Our slide on page 15 illustrates that our growing production profile is coming in at lower incremental cost. And that will drive our unit cost down as we go forward. For 2019, our average net unit cash cost net of byproduct credits was $1.74 per pound. We're projecting a similar level in 2020 for the average, and that reflects a lower top-line unit net site production cost in 2020, but it\u2019s offset by lower unit byproduct credits. We're assuming in these estimates $10 a pound for moly. Moly prices did decline some in the fourth quarter and are currently around the $10 level. But, there's a $0.03 per pound impact for each $2 change in molybdenum for 2020. As we move to 2021 because we are ramping up production, the unit cash costs are expected to decline by 25% from the 2019 and 2020 averages, and that's just a function of scale at Grasberg. We expect that at full rate, the underground operations in Indonesia will be among the lowest in the world. And the innovation and productivity initiatives in the Americas is also expected to deliver lower incremental costs than our average. So, we're very focused on bringing the unit costs down as we build scale and productivity in the operations. On slide 16, we show a modeled result of our EBITDA and cash flows at various prices, copper prices. We\u2019re holding gold flat in these models are at $1,500, and molybdenum flat at $10 a pound over this period. In 2019, our EBITDA totaled about $2.7 billion, and that was at an average copper price of $2.73 per pound. For 2020, we're estimating EBITDA would range between $3 billion and $5 billion at copper prices between $2.75 and $3.25. And notably, and this is this is where the leverage of the increased volumes come in at -- the average of 2021 and 2022, EBITDA would grow to $6.5 billion to $8.5 billion, using the same price range. So, when we look at 2021 and 2022, we go from $2.7 billion in EBITDA in 2019 to over $6.5 billion in 2021 and 2022 at current prices. This is all from existing projects that are in advanced stage. As we've been emphasizing, it's about execution. Over the next few quarters, achieving our key milestones will continue to derisk the plan. We have a similar story for operating cash flows net of our cash taxes and interest. Our operating cash flows grow from $1.5 billion in 2019 and would range from over $4 billion to $6 billion in 2021, and 2022, with copper prices ranging from current levels to $3.25 per pound. As our cash flow grows, we're going to be very-disciplined about capital spending to target increase returns to shareholders as we complete the transition at Grasberg. Slide 17 shows our capital expenditures for 2019 and projected spend for 2020 and 2021. Capital expenditures totaled $2.65 billion for 2019 and are expected to total $2.8 billion in 2020. We've included about $150 million in capital investments in 2020, associated with our innovation and productivity project. That has a very quick payback and will add long-term value. We\u2019ve added 100 million pounds of copper in 2021 and 200 million pounds in 2022. So, you can see the quick payback of those projects. And I think it's going to build the foundation of improved long-term value of our Americas businesses as we go forward. The balance of capital in 2020 includes $1.3 billion in underground capital spending at Grasberg and the completion of the Lone Star project. We\u2019ve also got sustaining capital in $1 billion range. For 2021, we expect capital to decline by about $400 million, and we\u2019ve included $1.2 billion in sustaining capital and the balance for projects, mostly related to Grasberg. I will note that the underground capital at Grasberg is expected to decline significantly beginning in 2020. As Richard mentioned, we've got a big part of the infrastructure completed. And so, we do see capital beginning to decline significantly from Indonesia, beginning in 2022 and beyond. We're continuing to manage our capital expenditures very carefully and thoughtfully. The investments we are making now are in advanced stage. They're going to strengthen our margins at low prices and enhance our long-term asset base, while providing leverage to improve markets over time. The amounts do not include the new smelter in Indonesia in which FCX will share a 49% of the economics. We've got some information on the smelter on the next slide on slide 18, the status update of where we stand. We're in the process of completing our engineering studies and expect to have confirmed project costs and project schedules during 2020. The preliminary capital cost estimate on 100% basis approximates $3 billion for this project with capital estimated to be in the $500 million range for 2020. We're in the process of making the necessary improvements to the ground at the land side in East Java, Indonesia. We\u2019ve also made very good progress on our financing discussions. They're at an advanced stage with a syndicate of banks. And we expect the bank facility will be available during 2020 to fund the capital over time as it\u2019s required. We are planning for the financing to be made at PT-FI without recourse to FCX, and for the new facility to be drawn as needed to offset cash outlays for smelter. So, we do not expect the dividends out of PT-FI to be burdened by smelter development capital during the construction period. We've included a chart at the bottom of this slide to show the after tax costs of the debt service. And you will see here that in this example we show an amortization of the capital cost spread over the life of the existing reserves. The initial financing will be shorter term but can be financed -- refinanced. And this illustrates what the cost of it is over the remaining 20-plus-year life of reserve. But, the net impact on FCX's equity share is about $88 million per year. We're also showing here that as part of the smelter development, we will be phasing out the export duty that PT-FI currently pays. It's currently 5%. And as that is phased out, the savings average over the life of the mine is a similar amount of almost $80 million. So, we've got the cost here but also the benefit of reducing the -- phasing out the export duty. We also will have the benefit of having operating costs at the smelter, which should be very competitive compared to global TC and RC markets. Turning to slide 19. We're just summarizing here where we are from a debt position, net debt position. We ended 2019 with just below $8 billion in net debt. We've got a strong balance sheet, good liquidity position. We have $2 billion in cash and an undrawn credit facility. So, strong liquidity, and we do not have significant maturities until 2022. And in closing, before we take your questions, we just want to reiterate where we are in terms of establishing the necessary production we need to grow our revenues and cash flows. We're very positive about the financial outlook. The initiatives that we have in place are advancing in line with the expectations. And we're focused on continuing to hit the milestones in 2020, executing effectively and delivering on these plans. So, those will all translate into substantial growth and revenues, margins, and free cash flows, as we go forward. So, we appreciate the attention. And now, operator, we\u2019d like to open the call for questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line and Alex Hacking with Citi. Alex Hacking : Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. And thanks for the question. I have a couple of questions on South America, if that's okay. Firstly, on Cerro Verde, it looks like costs will be going up this year. Is that primarily due to the grade decline? And how should we think about that going forward? I think, you're mining around 0.35% today, which I think is around wherever reserve grade is. So, how should we think about that going forward? Second question, your JV partner El Abra, Codelco has announced cuts to their CapEx budgets going forward? Does that affect El Abra in any way or you're thinking about the future of El Abra? Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, Alex. It's Kathleen. The grades in Cerro Verde were about 0.36 in 2019. We're expecting that to be about 0.33 in 2020 and are not expecting in the near term further decline. But, what we are doing is ramping up the concentrator there. We've got -- it's already producing 10% above where it was originally designed. But, Red and the team have identified opportunities to increase the concentrating rating rate to 420,000 tons a day, and that would be the biggest concentrator in the world. We expect that to start coming in, in 2021. So, we've got relatively flat grades at 0.33%, but very large scale. And these efficiency initiatives are going to help Cerro Verde, the ones that Richard was referring to about the mine-related initiatives, the CHLOE project that's being piloted at Cerro Verde. So, we're really positive about Cerro Verde to continue to try to improve efficiency of its mining rate to see the big mill that it has there. On El Abra, we're not anticipating any changes with the partnership we have with Codelco, we work very closely with them on the expansion opportunities. At El Abra, we're really focused on continuing to optimize what we have. We're currently looking at the evaluating expansion project but not looking to pull any trigger on that right now. So, we have substantial time with the existing operations to consider what's next. I don't know Red, do you want to add anything on Cerro Verde, or\u2026 Red Conger : So, let me just say, with El Abra, we are working cooperatively with Codelco on it. They're encouraging us to work on it. We're not planning on initiating major new expansion projects, until we complete this process of the underground conversion at Grasberg. And so, we're studying it now along with expansion at Bagdad and others. And we'll be doing tradeoffs to see what makes sense when the time comes to make decisions on expansion. So, we think that if it does come down to a joint decision to expand El Abra that there'll be sources of capital to finance it. So, I don't think that's going to be a constraint to us. But that's a future decision to be made. Operator : Your next question comes from the line is Carlos de Alba with Morgan Stanley. Carlos de Alba : So, just in terms of the smelter financing in Indonesia, Kathleen. Have you been facing any pushbacks, or what obstacles are you getting from the conversations with the banks? When do you really think during this year that you can grab this issue for good, so your Company can move on and investors can feel more confident where the money is going to come from and at what rate? And then, if I may ask Richard or Kathleen, do you have an early sense of the potential CapEx estimate for the oxide expansion Lone Star, and when do you think you can be ready to make a decision? Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Carlos, the answer to your first question is, we are in an advanced stage of discussions with them, with a group of banks we have been for several months. We are very close to having $3 billion in commitments raised. And so, we do expect the facility to be in place in time for the -- to fund the capital. We don't -- we haven't been spending that much capital on it. Most of the work to-date has been on ground improvements and we\u2019re doing the engineering studies right now, so. But, we do expect that the bank facility will be in place in 2020 ahead of when it\u2019s needed to fund the $500 million that we're talking about estimate for 2020. There really hasn't been pushback. There is strong interest in PT Freeport Indonesia. It does -- Freeport PT-FI, does not have existing debt. The banks like the strong sponsorship of our partner Inalum and FCX. And so, there hasn't been pushback on it. Richard Adkerson : Yes. To say -- it\u2019s contrary to push back. There is a very positive reception in the banking community participating this. So, it\u2019s -- and you know, it\u2019s because as Kathleen says, PT-FI has no debt. The banks like to do business with Freeport. They like to do business with Inalum. They like to do business with government of Indonesia. So, we have a positive reception for that. With respect to Lone Star, we are focused right now in getting this initial project up and running. As I said, production commences this year, and we're analyzing exploration data to make decisions on where to go from that. So, it\u2019s a work in progress on the future right now, both for an oxide expansion, and ultimately, I'm confident we'll do a sulfide project there. But that's all work in progress. Kathleen Quirk : But, there is a capacity at Safford, in the tankhouse there to do more than 200. And so, there could be some low capital mining equipment related things to raise the production at Lone Star. So, incremental expansions I think will come in at a very cheap capital cost. So, we have some flexibility there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riely FBR. Lucas Pipe : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Richard Adkerson : Hey, Lucas. Lucas Pipe : I wanted to take a closer look at 2022 production. So, on slide 13, you show a growth through 2022 and there's about 300 million pounds of growth versus -- in 2022 versus 2021 and then you have 200 million pounds from the efficiency drive, and then on slide 31 you show also 300 million pounds of growth from Indonesia. So, in short, should we be thinking about the efficiency drive offsetting depletion? And if so, where would we be seeing that depletion in 2022? Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : It just varies, Lucas. We\u2019ve got some higher grades in 2021 than we have in 2022. So, it\u2019s not necessarily depletion. It's just we do have some variability in grades, principally in North America. So, 2021, we benefit from having some higher grades, compared to 2020 and 2022. But, most of the growth is coming from Indonesia that year. But, we've also been able to offset this lower grade in 2022 with the efficiency impacts. Lucas Pipe : That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then, I wanted to ask about kind of the CapEx outlook, past 2021. I think, you mentioned in your prepared remarks Kathleen that Indonesian spending should be dropping substantially. But, can you elaborate what would be kind of a ballpark for the two major buckets with mining and then major projects beyond 2021, specifically. Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : I think we mentioned the Indonesia development capital for underground averaging about $1 billion a year. In 2020, it\u2019s a bit higher than that. But, by 2022, it's well below that average, probably half that average and then starts to decline as we go forward. So, that's when you see the capital really falling off is after 2022. We have projected very low capital for underground development. We've obviously invested a lot in the past. But that's -- we're at the peak now and it's declining. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Korn : Hey. Good morning, everyone. I just want to say, as it's been through the years, it's been great to see the progress made at Grasberg. I appreciate the work gone into that. Couple questions for me, just in the near term. Expectations for the first quarter reflect a pretty big step back in production, step up in per pound costs. Essentially, is that due to this being the first quarter where you're completely out of the open pit? And then second, Kathleen, I wanted to ask a little bit more on just the accounting for the smelter, as this comes through over the course of the year. Just to make sure. The debt\u2019s going to be consulted in the balance sheet. I expect the total 100% spending for the smelter come through on your cash flow statement. But, can you help us out with some of the other pieces or the other offsets that would reflect your partner's participation there? That would be very helpful. Thanks. Kathleen Quirk : Okay. In terms of the first item, the production for the first quarter, you're right about that, Matt, the main difference is the Grasberg. We don't have the open pit any longer. So, that's the biggest impact on the first quarter. We also do have some variances at Cerro Verde already, primarily in our estimates for the first quarter. And for South America, the first quarter is the lowest for the year, based on our current mine plan. So, really, first quarter for all sites is low, but ramping up during the year. And it's just mine planning as usual. We'll try to produce as much as we can that fits within the overall mine plan. On the smelter, you are correct that it is consolidated. You'll see it in our consolidated results in capital expenditures, when it will be in our consolidated debt. And what we tried to do on slide 16 is to let you understand really what the economic impact is. It'll be financed at the PT-FI level. So, we won't have -- FCX will not have cash to put in for the smelter, nor will our partner. It'll be financed at the PT-FI level. And so, really, the impact that FCX will see from an economic standpoint is the effect on dividends coming out of PT-FI. And what we're showing here is really with the benefit of having the export duty phased out, and that'll offset essentially the debt service. So, that's really the economic impact. But, when you look at the financial statements, it will be in the consolidated results. But, we want to focus on what the true economics are. Richard Adkerson : So, Matthew, you've touched on a important point that I think everybody understands. But, just to make sure there\u2019s an understanding, our new structure with Inalum, the state owned company in Indonesia differs from where we were with our previous partner, Rio Tinto, as Rio Tinto is a joint venture interest. Now, there's the entity PT-FI, which has two shareholders, Inalum 51%, FCX 49%, but it's the entity PT-FI that will be building the smelter that\u2019s doing the financing at the entity level. And while PT-FI -- FCX only owns 49% of the economics, that's close to the economic interest we had under the Rio Tinto structure. So, that's why we're very happy about it. Through a shareholders' agreement, FCX retains operating control over the operations. So, it's just important to understand that -- if there had been equity requirements of shareholders, that would have been made 51-49. But we concluded that the availability of this low cost bank financing is so attractive that that's the best way to finance this. And as Kathleen says, when you look through it and the fact that the export duty is going away, there's not really a lot of difference, plus there's going to be some impact of having an incremental major smelter in the world on global PCs and RCs, which will be beneficial to the rest of our business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Murphy with Barclays. Matthew Murphy : Hi. Kathleen, I had a question on the slide 16. If I look at 2020 operating cash flow, let's say the $2.75 per pound scenario, and I compare that to your presentation from Q3, the drop looks a little more than just the byproduct assumptions. So, I'm wondering has anything else changed in the expectations? You said top line production costs would be down. But, are they down less than you expected at Q3 or anything else that can explain that change? Kathleen Quirk : The big differences between last quarter's forecast and this one is we made a change in molybdenum you noted that from $12 to $10. We also have incorporated our new mine plans and some of the studies we're doing that are expensed in our -- for the innovation projects, and then, just some changes in timing on tax payments. So, nothing really major, beyond those changes in assumptions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Chris Terry : Hi, Richard and Kathleen. Thanks for taking my questions. Two for me. First one just on cash flow and thinking about other ways you can reduce your net debt further. Just wondered if you could touch on working capital over the next 12 months or so. And then also, you\u2019ve done a good job on the asset sales in 4Q. Just wondered if there is any other assets in the portfolio, JVs et cetera where you can monetize some of the rest of the portfolio that we might be missing. That\u2019s my first question. Thanks. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. Thanks, Chris. And I think you saw we did complete some asset sales in the fourth quarter and we\u2019ve got some additional potential transactions that we\u2019ll continue to look at, if they make sense economically, where we do have some non-core assets that are not producing that potentially could be monetized for cash. So, we\u2019ll continue to look at that if we can do at a valuation that is positive for our shareholders. Continuing to work on reducing working capital at -- all of our teams and Red's team continue to look at our supply chain and how we can gain better efficiencies of using supplies that we already have across the organization to share those resources. During the fourth quarter, you could see we did bring down our sales concentrate and finished goods and inventory. We\u2019ll continue to try to focus on doing that. But that's an area of focus as all of us are focused on this transition period and really trying to conserve cash as much as possible, so that as we go into the improved, we can be in a position to begin returning more cash to shareholders. Chris Terry : Okay. Thanks a lot. And then, my other question just relates to CapEx as well. I know you've gone through that on number of the other questions. But, I just wanted to touch on -- so the smelter totaled $3.5 billion in 2020. Would we expect sort of an even split of 800 roughly for the other three years to go at 2023? Kathleen Quirk : We're in the process of getting final engineering done and project schedules. So, we don't have at this point an exact estimate of capital cost. I would expect just based on our preliminary estimates that the capital in 2020, one would be slightly above the average you just talked about and in 2023 be slightly below. I think most of the capital will be spread between 2021 and 2022. But that's I think for your modeling purposes, which you have is probably pretty close. Chris Terry : Okay, thanks. And then, just as well on CapEx for 2020, your guidance was 2.6, gone to 2.8. Is that just a timing issue against 2021, 2022 or is there something that moved there in terms of the buckets? Thanks. Kathleen Quirk : Well, most of the increase, we\u2019ve got $150 million in our 2020 plan for this productivity initiative, which is adding 100 million pounds of copper in 2021 and 200 million in 2022. So, when you look at the CapEx, you\u2019ll also have to consider how much production we're adding in the near term. So, it's got a very quick payback. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Orest Wowkodaw : Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to again return back to unit costs. I've been a bit surprised about just the upward trend that we've seen in both North America, South America. And in your guidance of I guess about 130 a pound for 2021, does that assume that unit costs continue kind of in North America, South America around that $1.90 to $2 mark. Kathleen Quirk : We do show some slight benefit in that period in North and South America, beginning in 2021. The one thing that -- just to keep in mind that we've been doing in recent years is increasing our mining rate, which is going to set us up for better production, more flexible production in the future. And so, what you\u2019ve seen in 2018-2019 is a big increase in our mining rate from where we took it down after the market change in 2016. So, we've been building back the mining rate. That's going to give us better long-term value and more consistent performance as we go forward. But, we're not projecting increases like we've had in recent years. And in fact, these productivity initiatives, the volumes are coming in at lower incremental costs. So, we do expect to have that trend reversed as we look into 2021. Orest Wowkodaw : Okay. And longer term, I mean assuming grades only decline in the future or stay flat at best, are we -- should we anticipate the North America, South America costs are going to be, I don't know, somewhere in the $1.80 range? Kathleen Quirk : Yes. I mean, that's part of the reason we are aggressively moving on these initiatives is we are very focused on maintaining of cost position, despite the fact that you have longer hauls and changes in grades over time. So, that's really what we're focused on is how do we offset -- more than offset inflation and these other factors that affect not only our mines, but mines across the industry that have different profiles as they mature. Orest Wowkodaw : Okay. And then, finally, just on the Q1 production -- sales guidance of 725 million pounds. Can you tell us what the Grasberg copper is, embedded in that number? Kathleen Quirk : It's about 115, 120 million pounds. Orest Wowkodaw : Okay. So, that would imply there's quite a step down in North America, South America than in Q1? Kathleen Quirk : From the fourth quarter. Yes. I think, I mentioned that because we also had -- we've got lower production in the first quarter, we also had some sales timing, you\u2019ll recall that boosted fourth quarter sales versus the production in the fourth quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Chris LaFemina : Just on Grasberg, the operational progress with the Black Cave and the Deep MLZ has been very impressive over the last few quarters. And in fact, the Deep MLZ, I think you're tracking well ahead of where you had expected. If you think about the -- well, I guess, there is a lot of scale and complexity to these projects, a lot of moving parts. But in terms of the risks now going forward, do you feel like most of the risk in those projects is largely behind us, and you have a very high level of confidence around the ramp-up there? And what really are the key risks going forward now? I mean, the caving is working, the hydraulic fracing is working. Is it just a matter of making these things bigger and ramping them up or are there any other kind of critical tasks that you need to get through before you can confidently say that we've achieved success with these projects? Richard Adkerson : So, I think I did say that when you step back and look at where we were, as we were looking forward for this -- and we've been looking forward to this ever since mid 90s, when we developed the plans for the open fit design in the Grasberg pit. I mean, we were thinking about where to go, and over time, the recourse just got bigger and bigger and bigger. The big issue for us was developing this infrastructure, and that is largely behind us. I mean, we've got some crushers to complete that we're constructing out, some power, looking at a mill improvement. But, the fundamental impact -- we\u2019re developing some visuals. If you could see this thing, it is incredible. I mean, the sheer size of the adits and the crushers in this ore train, and all of these things. That was a real big risk thing going into this. And that's essentially behind this. Now, we're opening up these drawbells and propagating case. And it's done in sections. And so, each one of those are of a scale that's not larger than what we've done in the past in mining the DOZ, the IOZ, DOZ and so forth. So, there's ongoing things to deal with. There'll be different kinds of ground conditions we have to face. But, what's going to be so great about this is that we will have flexibility in going from one of these faces to another as we deal with it. So, mining always has its risk and I don't want anyone to sit here and say that we don't. But, I got to tell you the big risk associated with this underground development, in my opinion, Mark, I think you'll agree with this, right, are behind us. So, it's now a question, it's more of an operating thing now, it\u2019s more of operations. And that's what we've been so good at over time. Mark Johnson : So, one thing I'd add there too just -- this is Mark Johnson, is there's nothing unique with the equipment we're adding, it's more of the same. Our manpower levels at the underground stay flat. So, we kind of transition people from development roles into operating roles. So, from a training and recruiting standpoint, we're well-positioned right now. So, as Richard said, it's more of the same. These mine areas are opening up. It's much like a pushback in open pit. As add pushbacks, you have more work areas. We are adding more production blocks, more cave fronts. And it just provides that room for all the additional drawbell construction. So, in Deep MLZ, still the seismicity is something we watch very closely. With the hydrofracking area, all the tools that we\u2019ve acquired are mitigating those quite well. We're very confident there. We're well-positioned to be able to continue to do that. It's going to be one of our units of operations throughout the Deep MLZ. In GBC, it's just -- as Kathleen has mentioned before, it\u2019s the same ore-body. The grades are trending well, mine grades relative to what we thought. So, yes, we believe we -- every month, every quarter, we're getting better positioned. Much of those risks, much of the challenges are behind us. Richard Adkerson : And you know there is another factor that as I think about it in response to your question, our labor situation right now is so much better than it has been since 2011 or 2012. I mean, the team is motivated, everybody is working together, relationships with the union is good. Our relationships with the government is much, much improved. And so, there were a lot of these issues that had an impact over time in what we were doing. When we had strikes and blockages and all those sort, that's not part of our situation now, and we don't anticipate it being part of the situation going forward. So, just a lot -- we just all have this great thing about the way things are going here and it's a lot of things coming together, getting this work done, but also selling down with the government, developing good relationships with the workforce. Security situation has been good, although security in Papua will continue be a concern of the government. But in our area, security has been good. And so, we're just moving along and it\u2019s moving in a very positive direction. Chris LaFemina : Well, congratulations on the progress. Sounds like a good time for a site visit? Richard Adkerson : Yes. We are looking forward to it. We are looking forward to it. And I think there have been things that kept us from doing that in the past but we are -- nobody goes to that place and comes away from it, with the same feeling. I was visiting with JS in London LME week. And even though they're out of it, he just kept talking over and over about what a fabulous operation it is and engineering accomplishments. So, it\u2019s -- we look forward to giving you a chance to see it. Chris LaFemina : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. John Tumazos : Thank you very much. I'm looking at the slide nine on Lone Star and I just want to make sure I comprehend it. There were 68 holes, I guess in the upper row that averaged intercepts 0.56 copper. Were those the holes prior to 2019, and were the 28 holes that averaged 0.82%, the 2019 holes? Richard Adkerson : They're not divided that way, John. They're just shown for illustrative purposes, as we got the data in. So... Kathleen Quirk : To show the number of holes where we have the higher grade intercepts. John Tumazos : So\u2026 Red Conger : And some of those intercepts wouldn't be inside of ultimate pits, even at this point at pits that are drawn at today's copper prices, $2.50 copper prices. So, they're not -- these are just the size of the mineral endowment there's what we're trying to show. John Tumazos : Presumably the high grade stuff is into it? Red Conger : We're going to see. As Richard pointed out, we're building the mineral models, we're going to float columns and do all of that analysis. Richard Adkerson : So John, we had some historical drilling there. And we were able to use even before 2015, I mean, this ore-body has an exploration target for many, many years. And so, we upgraded the drilling. We initially did enough to take advantage of the available facilities at Safford as it was winding down. So, the first project was how can we use these facilities at Safford. We continue to drill. And as we continue to drill, some of it is outside of that planned current production. We're finding very attractive opportunities, which we are now analyzing. And those opportunities include oxide, as Kathleen said there's a possibility of being able to further use Safford. There may be an opportunity to do other capital investment to take advantage of that resource. And then, we continue to develop the sulfide. So, this is very much an unfolding story. But, as it does unfold, the exploration use continues to be very positive. John Tumazos : What grade does the 200 million pound production plan assume? Red Conger : We'll have to look that out. Richard Adkerson : We\u2019re shuffling through paper. We'll find it for you. John Tumazos : Sure. And if there are these high grade zones, are you going to build an electro winning tankhouse for 200 million pounds of capacity, or 300 or more million pounds capacity, or will you take the pregnant solution to the old Safford tankhouse or Miami or Tyrone? It sounds like some of these ores are almost like having a twin, because it has twice some of the ores, has twice as much copper as other ores. Richard Adkerson : That's right. And as I said, the initial project was to not build new tankhouses for this project but to use what we had available at Safford. And there is still excess capacity at Safford, which would allow us to expand the current project. The next step would be to say do we invest in new processing facilities to match up with the resource that we're finding, and then ultimately with the sulfide. So, it's not going to go to Miami or any of that. It\u2019s -- we're going to use as much as we can effectively of the existing facilities at Safford. Next step will be say, do we do some incremental investment in new facilities, take advantage of the resource. And then ultimately, and this is down the road, if we get to that sulfide, and that could be a very major project for us. Because -- and as I said potentially be a new Morenci. So, that's what's exciting about this. Kathleen Quirk : John, the reserve grade at Lone Star of oxide, as you probably know, is in the point 0.44 average range. In the early years, we expect the leach ore to be slightly above that in the 0.5 range as -- in the early years. And as Richard was saying, as we mine the oxide, generate cash flow off of the oxide, that really is going to increase the value of ultimate development down the road because effectively we're restricting them -- the ore-body. Richard Adkerson : Yes. And that's what's great about this, John, because of Safford being there, normally you have a big sulfide resource, you face all this, and you see this example of other projects being developed. You have this massive stripping costs into the today's world where grades aren\u2019t as high. Stripping gets to be a big part of the cost of what you're doing here. Our stripping is creating value. A combination of where it is, near Safford and yet it is stripping and it's going to expose what looks to be a massive sulfide opportunity for us for the future. John Tumazos : If I could ask one last one, and forgive me. I read of the overture you had from another company a week or two ago. And clearly you're on the brink of copper recovering, new projects, getting Indonesia down, et cetera. And you don't want someone to take a shot at you just before everything turns up. Do you think it\u2019d be a good idea to do a share buyback? Your balance sheet\u2019s turned around and 1 billion or 2 billion of stock buyback might be -- it's nice to be complimented or flattered, but you don\u2019t want somebody trying to do a merger with you just before everything turns around? Richard Adkerson : So, I do not think the time is right to do a share buyback. And John, you know how long I've worked in this industry. And the one thing that comes home to me through all the things that we at Freeport have been through over the years is life is much better with less leverage than more leverage. And we make progress with reducing our leverage. We're on the verge right now of generating substantial cash flows, which will allow us to further reduce leverage and return to being able to increasing returns to shareholders. I believe that's the right answer for us and that's what we're going to be focused on doing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Just -- I know we're running a bit late, but just one question for me. Can you just add a little bit more color on the maintenance shutdown we saw at Grasberg in the fourth quarter? I know you installed some ore flow equipment. What was that specifically? And how should we think about 2020? Do you have any particular equipment installation, maintenance shutdown, processes planned sometime in the near future? That's all for me. Thank you. Mark Johnson : Yes. This is Mark Johnson. We mentioned it in the last quarter update, the planned shutdown. We had one conveyor that in the ore flow system that was able to collect the ore from the Grasberg open pit, and this same belt also collects ore from the Grasberg Block Cave. We no longer needed the portion of that belt that serviced the pit. So, we shortened that belt by about 40%, which just makes the longer-term system more robust. So, it\u2019s a matter of taking the tail portfolio of that belt and moving it to a different location. And then, we also modified a bunch of the motors that control, so that would be a much more modern system for this long-term application at the Grasberg Block Cave. Going forward, we obviously have maintenance plans. They are built into our production plan, that's integral to our planning, looking at crushers, conveyors, mill, which we've always done. So, going forward, the production plans are reflective of our maintenance plans. There's nothing significant or unique coming out. We continue to incrementally add to our infrastructures, as Richard discussed. The rail systems, all those things just continue to grow, but it's all going quite well and on plan. Richard Adkerson : So, stepping back, we just had this conversation with Mark, what's going to be key for us to meet these production plans [Technical Difficulty] and Mark, don\u2019t let me get way out ahead of myself here, but we don\u2019t see that as mining. We see it really as being able to deliver this massive amount of ore from the mining activities to the mill facilities. And this is not, I mean, we benefit by gravity here. We're developing these mines horizontally and not vertically. And so, it's not terribly complicated, but what it does require you to do is make sure you stick with these maintenance programs. And because if you don't stick with the maintenance programs, you're going to have unplanned issues, and that's a lot more complicated. So, throughout the whole system, there is this constant deal of planned maintenance programs. And we really -- our Americas team is supporting our operations out there to make sure that we have our arms around this, because that's what we need to manage to ensure that the ore that we can mine and mining has got its complications, but we are confident about that. But making sure we don't get hamstrung by the fact that we\u2019re moving this massive amount of ore and that our systems are well-maintained and operated to allow us to do it. Andreas Bokkenheuser : That is very clear. Thank you very much for the clarification. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jatinder Goel with Exane BNP Paribas. Jatinder Goel : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking questions. A couple more from my side, please. Firstly on these productivity enhancement projects, you mentioned $150 million included in current year\u2019s CapEx guidance. Are you able to give a number for 2021 that's included in your current 2021 CapEx guidance? And is that the only spend that you need to do to keep 200 million pounds of production run rate, or would you still need to spend more beyond 2021 as well? Second question is on moly. You are still using $13 price for 2021 cost guidance, but you've taken your production guidance down and you are using $10 for this year. So, just trying to square that you do seem to have spare capacity in the system and $13 looks like a good price, how do I reconcile lowered volume but still using $13 for 2021 cost guidance, please? Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. We don't have much capital in 2021 for the productivity initiatives. Total was $200 million, and $150 million of that is in 2020. We spent some in 2019 and we'll have some in 2021. But that is the capital that\u2019s mainly mining equipment and the development costs of these data models that are included in those numbers. So, we do feel that -- and that's what we'll continue to do is to try to do this on with low capital intensity. So, that's -- as we go forward, we'll look to see if there's other incremental projects that have a very quick payback. But at this point\u2026 Richard Adkerson : Yes. We hope we'll add some. It won't be massive amounts. But we -- our hope is that this thing will identify areas that we can spend a little bit of capital and generate good returns -- big returns off of it. Because it is very high returns versus having to build new concentrators and things like that. So that's what's in our plan right now. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. And then, on the roll forward of the cost. We kept the moly assumption consistent with what we had used previously. At $13 moly, it might make sense for us to increase our primary molybdenum production. But that'll be something that we\u2019ll evaluate. We've been, as you\u2019ve seen in the numbers, we've been cutting back the primary moly production because of market conditions. And we don't want to provide and put a surplus into the market because we have so much volume that comes from our byproduct mines. But, we'll have that opportunity to look at if that\u2019s -- if prices do improve, what the moly production would be from the primary mines. But the byproduct mines are the ones that are included in the cash unit costs that we provide. Richard Adkerson : Yes. We clearly have the capacity to add to those volumes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli Funds. Chris Mancini : Hi, everybody. Thanks for the questions. On slide 18, quickly, the $180 million of annual debt service for the smelters, does that include amortization of the $3 billion loan or is it just interest? Kathleen Quirk : It does include amortization, spread out over the remaining life, so over the roughly, 19-20 years after the smelter\u2019s operational. So, it assumes that it's financed over the life of the reserves. And as I mentioned, we\u2019ll likely have a shorter term financing at first, but that can be refinanced as we go forward. So, it was principal on interest. Chris Mancini : Okay, thanks. And do you expect any return from the actual investment. So, meaning like, once the smelter\u2019s built, if we were to include any profitability from the smelter, can we like subtract that from the 180 in terms of what the ultimate kind of cost of the smelter is? Kathleen Quirk : What we're showing here on the right of that chart that by building the smelter we can phase out the export duty. Okay? So, that offsets essentially this principle on interest. But other benefits that we get from the smelter, one, we got an extension of our mine life through 2021. Two, we expect that once the smelter is operational, smelter cash costs generally are below $0.20 a pound. In fact, our line of copper operations were well below $20 a pound in 2019 compared to market rates in the $0.25 a pound range on average. So, you'll have some margins, depending on TC RCs. But, as Richard pointed out earlier, we also get a benefit to the rest of our operations and Cerro Verde and the Americas that with this capacity, it\u2019ll likely bring down market TC RC rates, and that will benefit our other operations that are paying market rates for treatment charges. Chris Mancini : Okay. It\u2019ll -- so you won't accept -- this won't accept any third-party concentrated, it will be just from Grasberg. And your costs should go down slightly, your treatment costs as right now you're shipping around half your concentrate. So, the treatment costs should go down a little bit. Kathleen Quirk : Correct. I was just going to say in terms of returns, our mining projects have much, much greater returns. But what the point is here is that we are going to be able to offset the capital cost and interest from the smelter and other benefits. Chris Mancini : Right. Is that cost benefit at $160 million a year of export duty reduction? Is that in your guidance now? Kathleen Quirk : Yes. Operator : Our finalquestion will come from the line of Oscar Cabrera with CIBC. Oscar Cabrera : Just concentrating, two questions, one in production, the other one in CapEx. So, Cerro Verde is producing about a billion pounds, or produces about a billion pounds a year, your throughput at 420,000 pounds per day, about 60,000 pounds per day higher than name plate capacity. So, was the plan to keep production at about the 1 billion pounds of that declining over the next five years? Kathleen Quirk : So, I think, Oscar, you right. I mean, we are having to offset the grade decline at Cerro Verde, and we are putting more through the concentrator. In 2020, we expect to be a bit below the 1 billion pounds, but return back to the 1 billion pound level in the years following 2020. Mark Johnson : And when we designed the plant, it was going to come off -- it would be off 1 billion pounds by now. So, we've been able to keep it at that level. Richard Adkerson : Yes. And that's what we hope to do with our mining initiatives, and all these things looking for -- I mean, we\u2019re just saying in passing 420,000. Oscar Cabrera : No, it's a big deal. Kathleen Quirk : It\u2019s the biggest in the world. I mean -- and we're really proud of it and -- and so, it gives us opportunity to say how can we maximize the resource in ways to help us. And we're going to -- I mean, that's Red\u2019s every day job, try to figure out how to drive the cost down, get more volume, be safe, should have said that for us, right, Red? Red Conger : You got it. Oscar Cabrera : Yes. Absolutely, doesn't get lost on us. So, the next question with regards to CapEx is at a higher throughput rate. Do you need to expand your tailings and do you have the permits for that? And if so, why would the CapEx be. Red Conger : Oscar, we\u2019re in good shape for tailings capacity. But, as we expand these reserves, we're doing tailing capacity studies, where do we put this material in the future and not only at Cerro Verde but at all of our operation. So, as Richard said, that's part of the ongoing work that we're doing all the time, how do we maximize these resources and take care of all the environmental and safety concerns, at the same time. Richard Adkerson : Fair to say, Red, though, at Cerro Verde that's a planning challenge, just not a constraint. Red Conger : Very well put. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. And, we've got 420,000 in site and permitted. Red has aspirations of going above 420, 000 and thinks that we could do that over the longer-term and then that\u2019s what he's talking about is having some planning around what would we need to do to move that up another increment. So, it's a great release. So, it\u2019s in a great concentrator facility. And we're working on scenarios to maximize the value. Oscar Cabrera : And then lastly, if I may, I think I missed this with one of the previous questions, the CapEx in Grasberg after 2021, would that return to about $1 billion a year? Kathleen Quirk : It\u2019s less than that. After 2022, it's substantially less than that, Oscar. 2022, it starts to trail off and then very low capital after that. So, that's when really you can harvest the cash flows associated with this higher production. Operator : I'll now turn the call over to management for any closing remarks. Richard Adkerson : Again, thank you all for participating. And we look forward to future reports. And David Joint is available to follow-up with any questions you might have. Thank you.

Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Conference Call, where management will discuss revised operating plans in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and first quarter financial results. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported our revised operating plans and our first quarter operating and financial results. A copy of today's press release and the presentation materials are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet. And anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today\u2019s call. And a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. We\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the Risk Factors described in our 2019 Form 10-K. On the call today is Richard Adkerson, our Chief Executive Officer; Red Conger is on; Mark Johnson is on from Indonesia, we\u2019ve got a number of other of our senior executives on the phone as well and they will be available to participate in our Q&A session. Our comments today in the prepared materials will be principally focused on our plans and our outlook and how we are addressing current market conditions. I'll briefly summarize our financial results for the first quarter and then turn the call over to Richard who will be reviewing our revised plans. As usual we'll open up the call for Q&A after our prepared remarks. We announced revised operating plans as you've seen in the, in the press release, we've had a series of cost reductions and capital expenditure reductions. We've also reduced our copper production volumes by 400 million pounds in response to market conditions in an effort to reduce our costs and capital expenditures. In terms of our first quarter results, we reported a net loss attributable to common stock of $491 million in the quarter that was $0.34 a share which included $256 million or $0.18 per share associated with inventory valuation adjustments and other items that are detailed in our press release attachment on VI. Adjusted net loss attributable to common stock totaled $235 million or $0.16 per share in the first quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA or earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation for the first quarter totaled $189 million. And we've included a reconciliation of our EBITDA calculation on Page 43 of our slide materials. Our first quarter sales, copper and gold were slightly higher than our January 2020 estimates. We sold 729 million pounds of copper during the quarter and 144,000 ounces of gold that mostly reflected higher production from PT Freeport Indonesia partially offset by lower sales volumes in the Americas. Our average realized price in the first quarter was $2.43 per pound that was 16% lower than a year ago average price of $2.90 per pound and the realized price for gold in the first quarter was just over $1,600 per ounce which was 24% above the first quarter of the prior year. Our consolidated average unit net cash costs were also lower than our expectations. They averaged a $1.90 per pound of copper in the first quarter and the estimate going into the quarter was about $2 per pound. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $600 million. That included roughly $300 million for projects that we're doing to increase production and reduce unit costs in Indonesia and also our Lone Star Project in the U.S. and Arizona. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.6 billion and consolidated debt of $10 billion. We had no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility and have significant liquidity as we manage volatility during 2020. I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard who will be referring to our slide materials. Richard Adkerson : So good morning, thank each of you for participating in today's call. I hope you and your families are well and staying safe during this very difficult time for everyone. Our Freeport family extends sympathy and support to all those that are impacted by the virus. And also by the very significant economic hardship that is brought over so many people. We appreciate particularly the global health care providers, government authorities and others who are on the frontlines working often at personal peril to protect our people and all people around the world. At Freeport, we are prioritizing the health and safety of our workers. While we support the communities where we operate, as we serve customers with the ongoing requirements of copper. The copper is an essential metal for the global economy even in today's world. The plan we're announcing today is a comprehensive response by our company following a carefully planned-process-to develop proactive actions, first to save our people and our business and then to protect the value of our assets for the long-term. Very proud of our Freeport team for the response they developed in a very short period during a time when the world faces this unprecedented pandemic crisis. Our team has responded in the right way with the right attitude of commitment and cooperation. Our revised plan will target year end 2020 financial liquidity that at current copper prices actually exceeds the liquidity that we had targeted in our annual plan announced just a quarter ago and that was when copper prices were 20% - more than 20% higher than today\u2019s price. What we had to do with this plan was offset the loss of approximately $1.7 billion of cash flow from lower prices. We've done this by reducing spending, revising mine plans, and taking a series of financial initiatives. Importantly, we have contingency plans to preserve our business if the copper price were to fall further. What this plan will do is carry us over the brighter days for our company. When production volumes increased substantially with the ramp up of our new underground mines in Indonesia, 2021, and as the world economy recovers, whenever that might be. Our Freeport team has done fabulous work by making tough decisions in developing the plan, while we are protecting our workers, treating them fairly, I personally cannot thank our team enough for the work done in developing this plan. We fully recognize the uncertainties we all face about the duration and extent of the pandemic and its impact on the growing economies. Having said that, I'm confident the actions we are taking will allow Freeport to navigate this period of uncertainty and position our company for long-term success. Starting with Slide 3, I emphasize again that health and well-being of our people is number one priority. As we protect our workers, we are addressing the current financial challenge using our experience and successfully responding to past financial crisis. We have an existing playbook that we're following. But we're also taking into account current conditions and uncertainties. We are now undertaking aggressive proactive actions focused on protecting liquidity, by cutting costs, maximizing cash flows. Situation is dynamic and uncertain; we\u2019re prepared to do further adjustments to preserve liquidity and protect long-term values if we have to. Our company benefits in a major way from having extraordinary long lived and durable reserves and resources. I'm confident that the actions we're announcing today and our preparations to respond to further as required will make these assets even more valuable for shareholders in the future. Turning to Slide 4, we have implemented prudent health protocols in all of our locations. We do what we can to avert a spread of coronavirus in our operations. We're monitoring and following all the guidelines of international health organizations and governments. The effort is being led by a dedicated team of medical advisors and providers. Our procedures are robust, forward looking, proactive rather than reactive. Our international medical providers are administering, tracing, quarantine procedures on an ongoing basis. We severely restricted and in most cases, eliminated travel, group meetings have been eliminated, working virtually, and all work that can be done remotely is being done remotely. In our operations, physical distancing in mining processing is being achieved. Ours is not like a factory where people are working totally together. Truck drivers, shovel operators, other operators can work with social distance. At the site we provide housing, meals, transportation. We are being diligent with sanitization isolation of workers showing symptoms and treating workers who have potential illness with state-of-the-art equipment and facilities. Our management of worker health to-date has been very effective. We've experienced a limited less than 50 confirmed cases to-date across our global workforce which approaches 70,000 workers. But knowing just how fast this virus can spread, we remain diligent and proactive in protecting our people. Slide 5 addresses our commitment to communities where we operate. This commitment is longstanding and unwavering. These communities are the homes for our workers and their families. They are essential to our long term success. Across the globe we're supporting communities during this time of great need. We are prioritizing critical needs caused by COVID-19 and we continue to [technical difficulty]. Slide 6 presents the global span of our work force including employees and contractors. While a lot of countries are dealing with the pandemic in varying degrees, our workforce is adhering to global health standards, focusing on their personal safety, and the well-being of those around them. Our global team of workers is critical to our company's success and we fully recognize that. I personally appreciate the dedication, commitment, cooperation during this challenging time. Slide 7 we note that copper is a metal strategic to the world and its importance is growing. Freeport is a long time leading supplier of copper to the global economy. We're working closely with customers to meet their needs in today's world, protecting our business so we can reliably serve customers in the future. Copper is essential to global economy not only in times when the economy is growing but also in times like these when health care, water, food supply, communications and technology are critically important. Telecommunications, digital technologies, and cloud applications have ever been more important than in today's world. And copper is an essential element in meeting these requirements. On Slide 8 I want to note that many of you probably have seen recent reports on the growing recognition of copper's anti-microbial properties. Copper can play a significant role in preventing transmission of viruses and bacteria. This has been known for a long time. Our industry has supported research efforts and education efforts for the public to understand the benefits of copper in fighting the spread of infections in normal times. The current pandemic is bringing to light what copper can achieve in improving public health. Studies have demonstrated that copper can destroy viruses like COVID-19. Copper's use in health care equipment and facilities and in public places will undoubtedly grow significantly when the cost of copper which has been a barrier in the past is measured by the enormous cost to society that is being brought on by this pandemic. Freeport will be at the forefront of leading the world to understand the benefits, the greater uses of copper globally. To learn more about this, I refer you to the Copper Development Association's website and you can read articles about it almost every day in the press. On Slide 9, we talk about just how quickly the market conditions change. [Technical difficulty] seems like a lifetime. When FCX reported its fourth quarter results, the global economy was showing clear signs of progress. The phase one deal with China was encouraging after trade issues had burdened copper prices for the previous 18 months. The copper price was then $2.85 a pound and seem poised to move higher. Now, we have copper prices today about $0.50 per pound lower than in late January. And in recent times, we've seen copper trade down to near $2 a pound, totally unexpected. Meantime, the gold prices have risen dramatically. Gold is a benefit to operations in Indonesia. Oil markets are in turmoil. Diesel fuel roughly 8% of operating cost has declined roughly about 50%, dollar strengthened that lowers our U.S. dollar cost for expenditures in current local currencies. Many other input costs have dropped. The rapid change in markets required us to move quickly and aggressively digest our plans. Freeport's 2020 revenues were already abnormally low because of the transition of Grasberg to underground mining. We completed mining the massive Grasberg high volume open pit in December 2018. Today, PT-FI is effectively managing the coronavirus self-challenge. PT-FI is progressing at own schedule with the ramp up of its massive underground mines. This has been the critical strategic initiative for our company for many years. Continued progress with this ramp up will place Freeport in a much stronger cash flow position even if copper prices stay low in 2021 and beyond. The gold benefit of Grasberg's production is a major benefit as I said, the gold component Grasberg\u2019s production is a major benefit. It\u2019s what together with the good copper grades make this one of the mining industries, most fabulous assets. Of course gold is having its day in the sun, copper's day will come. On Slide 10, we talk about this transition that Grasberg moved to underground mining and with a current ramp up. We've incorporated in our original plans, our budget going into 2020 are prior to the current pandemic, doing the proactive steps to protect our balance sheet and liquidity. Over the past four years, we have cut what was then crippling debt levels in 2016 in half. During 2019, we extended our $3.5 billion bank credit facility currently undrawn for a new five-year term extending to 2024. Kathleen and her team also worked with our banks to obtain amendments to our bank credit revolving covenants, to give us flexibility during the Grasberg ramp-up. In recent months we've had two bond offerings raising a total of $2.5 billion in long-term notes at attractive rates which we used to refinance debt maturities. Today we have no significant near-term debt maturities. Slide 11 now addresses the aggressive actions we're now taking. Our team undertook a comprehensive and iterative process involving site managements across the company. Red Conger and his team in the Americas were facing the challenge this time around of not being supported by cash flows going out of - coming out of Indonesia. Cash we're generating in Indonesia is going into continuing to develop the underground. So what they got to do for each operation each individual mine was to develop a plan to maximize near-term cash flow at low prices while protecting long-term values. All the savings reflected in our new plans that we\u2019re reporting today are supported by detailed analysis. We left no stone unturned. This was not a top down exercise. The objective was set at the top. But our operating teams developed these plans and now own them. They are committed to executing them and our senior management team and our administrative organizations will support them. Everybody is on board. Our Board of Directors has deferred common stock dividends in 2020 prioritizing this. The Board will review dividend actions on a regular basis with the goal of restoring dividends when conditions improve. The chart on the right, summarizes the combined impact of these actions. Based on our January plan at $2.85 copper, we would have ended the year with a consolidated cash position of $1 billion before returning to significant cash flow generation in 2021 with Grasberg's ramp up and beyond. Despite this $0.50 a pound current reduction in copper prices, our revised plan is at $2.30 copper, plans we're announcing today project $1.7 billion in cash at year-end and increase in liquidity without raising new capital. This is a major accomplishment. Three, four weeks ago, we wouldn't have anticipated. We have stress test our plans at lower prices to ensure we have a plan to bridge us through 2020 regardless of prices, and put us in a strong position as we enter 2021 when we will be adding large-scale, low-cost volumes for Grasberg. Significantly, we've reserved a plan to double EBITDA in 2021 from this year's levels without higher copper prices. Slide 12 illustrates the impact of this. Execution of these plans will set us up for significant improvements in 2021, in part from changes in copper prices. Projecting a 26% increase in copper sales, volumes in 2021, 75% increase in gold volumes. The outlook takes into account approximately 400 million pounds of Americas production that we are idling in this plan. And our projections include that remaining idle in 2021, which we're adjusting if conditions improve. Our unit cost projected to decline, 2021 EBITDA would double, 2020 levels at $2.30 copper and $1,600 gold. Cash flow benefit from potential higher gold prices noted as well, many expect, as well as the potential for a return of copper prices to the levels we saw earlier this year. Looking at Slide 13, we note that our management team has had extensive experience in managing tough market environments. The leadership teams across the company are seasoned and have been effective and successful in past downturns. Prices is different, but in each of our past experiences, Freeport has come out stronger. We have a management structure and a team that is collaborative, experienced and decisive. Never cut corners on important issues involving worker safety or environmental obligations. We keep a long-term focus on our license to operate around the world that we worked so hard to earn. We adjust to market conditions quickly, develop contingency plans for further actions as required, do this on a site-by-site basis, a planned safeguard to protect long-term values. This is a real hallmark of this Freeport organization. Highlighted on the slide are actions we took in 2008, 2009 crisis [technical difficulty] 2014 and reached critically low levels in 2015 and 2016 when our company was heavily burdened by debt from our discontinued oil and gas business. Note where share prices were for FCX during each of these crises and the improvement within two years that follow. We're all committed to successful execution of these plans. We're all intensely focused on restoring value in our shares. Now I want to provide you a brief update of our operations and projects. Slide 14 addresses Cerro Verde. As reported previously, the Peruvian government declared a national emergency, which was just extended to May 10. This government order affects Cerro Verde and other mines in Peru. Our Cerro Verde team is doing great work in managing smaller-scale operations during this period while we protect the health of a much reduced workforce and as we work with the government to explain our health protocols so that we can position Cerro Verde for a restore to normal operations. Cerro Verde has been operating in excess of designed capacity for several quarters, chiefly mill throughput of over 400,000 metric tons per day, leading up to March 16. We are currently operating about 1/3 of this level. Our plans are developing and ramping up Cerro Verde late in the second quarter and returning to higher production levels in the second half. Returning Cerro Verde to normal production is important to the government of Peru and the community of Arequipa. Cerro Verde has been a large contributor to the national and local economy, one of the largest employers in the region. Slide 15 covers our new mine that we are developing in Eastern Arizona, adjacent to our Safford mine, very close to Morenci, called Lone Star. And we're nearing completion of this new mine, and we will commence production in the coming months. The project is 90% complete. Capital is largely behind us. We're advancing on schedule with pres-tripping, which we expect to complete in the third quarter. We've started to ramp up placement of ore on newly constructed leach pad at the nearby Safford operation. Project is forecast to add 200 million pounds of copper per year initially, with opportunities to increase production over time with low capital intensity. While we have great expansion opportunities at Lone Star, we are deferring those until the market conditions more. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity for Lone Star. We believe it will be a significant future cornerstone asset for Freeport in the United States. At Grasberg, very pleased to report that our Grasberg underground ramp-up is proceeding on schedule. Great cave propagation for the Grasberg Block Cave and the Deep MLZ mine continue to go well. We have achieved important milestones to establish large-scale production from these high-grade low-cost little blocks. Been consistently meeting or exceeding key performance indicators. I congratulate Mark Johnson & our PTF team for its noteworthy performance in advancing this massive undertaking in such an effective manner. During the first quarter, production from the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ together averaged over 37,000 tons per day, slightly in excess of our forecast at the beginning of the year, and over 44% higher than prior quarter rates. By the end of the first quarter, we were producing at a combined rate of over 40,000 metric tons per day. Rates will be increasing continually as we go forward. We've added almost 50 new drawbells at the 2 mines during the quarter compared with 34 in the fourth quarter. We now have 250 open drawbells, which are the rock funnels that allow us to gain scale in ore production. These are high-grade, large copper and gold ore bodies. It's noteworthy that the first quarter mill rate throughput was only about half of last year's first quarter yet PT-FI's quarterly metal production was similar to last year's first quarter. This demonstrates that these underground ore bodies can produce scale because of their grades. At full rates, the production of these 2 ore bodies is projected to average over 1.3 billion pounds of copper, 1.3 million ounces of gold per year. In the earlier years, we'll have higher grades, and that will yield higher metal production. Average net unit costs are expected to average less than $0.20 a pound in the first 5 years of full production rates. $0.20 a pound, that's notable and rare for large-scale operations in the global copper industry. Our PT-FI team deserves complements for their extraordinary performance in managing the health situation while continuing to execute on this major project. We have a workforce of about 30,000 people, a large portion of that work in the highlands, where they live in dorms, eat in mess halls. Our team is supported by world-class medical providers. They've been proactive with a series of actions to help us prevent any major outbreak at this remote location. Our testing and screening activities in one of the most remote places in the world are much more advanced than much of what we're seeing today in communities in the United States. Our PT-FI development operating team is supported by FCX's global world-class technical organization. PT-FI in Indonesia is benefiting now [technical difficulty] that was put in place in late 2018, where now we have a 51% shareholder that's a state owned company, named MIND ID and now we have a much more positive relationship with the government of Indonesia after our December 2018 IUPK permit. Unlike years past, now all stakeholder interest in our business in Indonesia are aligned. Slide 17 talks about the smelter that we committed to construct as part of the IUPK. We're facing delays with this project. It's located far from our operations in Papua, in a densely populated area of Eastern Java. We have notified the government of delays because of worker restrictions and supply chain issues, and we're in discussions to extend the December 2023 project deadline. We're also reviewing with the government other issues related to the smelter that might be mutually beneficial to PT-FI and the government. We do not expect to incur capital expenditures of significance in 2020 on the smelter as a result of the delays that we're experiencing. Slide 18 looks at copper markets. Copper prices have dropped from a weaker demand from the declining GDP, of course. On the other hand, supplies of copper have been impacted by the pandemic. Copper mines and development projects are being curtailed or canceled. Scrap market, which provides a large part of refined copper to the market, is currently very weak. We're encouraged by data now coming out of China, indicating an emerging recovery. There is strong likelihood around the world that ongoing stimulus actions will help economies recover. Despite the long - the near-term uncertainties, we're not trying to base our business on ours or anybody else's ability to predict these near-term situations. The long-term copper outlook for copper remains highly positive, and in some ways, being supported by the supply curtailments we're now seeing. Copper is strongly supported by fundamentals, has an essential role in the overall global economy, the major element in efforts to reduce carbon in the world, and the world is increasingly turning to electronics in so many respects, extended from electric vehicles, charging stations, but also 5G and other technical factors are going to require more electronics in the world. Supplies of copper continue to be limited. No one can predict with confidence when economies will recover. Copper is a highly attractive commodity to move - and is positioned to move substantially higher as economic conditions improve. Freeport will be a major beneficiary of this movement. I've included Slide 19 as an infographic, developed by the Copper Development Associations, what I thought does a great job of illustrating broad ranges of uses of copper in the economy. I'll just refer it to you and ask you to take a look at it when you have a moment to consider it. Slide 20 will present our reserve and resource position. We have long-lived and valuable resources that will be available for all organic growth development for decades to come. Volumes we've elected to curtail the current market will be more valuable in the future as economic conditions improve. Before turning to Kathleen, who will review the financial outlook in more detail, I want to close with the following. Freeport is foremost in copper. Looking beyond the current troubled conditions, copper is widely considered the best-positioned major commodity for our supply - from a supply demand standpoint. Freeport's portfolio of copper assets are large and high quality. We're an established industry leader, we operate the mines that we have interest in, which are among the largest in the world. And by operating all of our assets, it provides us valuable synergies and flexibility across the portfolio to deal with times like these and to take advantages of the brighter days to come. Our assets are long-lived, durable, with embedded option for reserve and resource growth. Strong franchises in the United States, South America and Indonesia. Near term, Freeport is in advanced stage for a major increase in margin and cash flows beginning in 2021, apart from copper price movements and extended for 20 years and further. We have industry-leading technical capabilities through strong track record of execution over many years. We've earned the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, our suppliers, financial markets, most importantly, our workers, communities and those countries where we operate. Our block caving experience is one of the most extensive and longest-standing in the history of the global mining industry. We've been operating block caves in Indonesia since the early 1980s, and we have an important aluminum of block cave operation in Colorado. This is a critically important factor as we transition Grasberg to the largest block caving operation in the world. Our experienced and battle testing management team has demonstrated the capabilities to perform in good times and bad. We are confident of our ability to \"improve our metal\" as we've done in the past. Slide 22, I want to close by talking about our people. Again, I want to recognize the strength and resiliency of the entire Freeport family who inspire me every day. I'm proud to be part of this team. We're all motivated and committed to persevere and achieve success for all of our stakeholders. Kathleen, I'll let you take over. Kathleen Quirk : Okay, thank you, Richard. I'll turn to Slide 24 and run through some of the details of our operating plans and financial outlook before we begin the Q&A session. On 24, we present a summary of our revised operating plans. As Richard was saying earlier, as we develop the new plans, we focus on reducing operating costs and capital expenditures while maintaining safety, reliability and the integrity of the long-range plans. In the Americas, we reduced mining rates across the board by about 20% in total. What this did, it had the impact of reducing all elements of our operating costs and the capital that higher mining rates would require. We note that this material is still there and available to us in the future as market conditions warrant. At our molybdenum mine in Colorado, the Climax mine, we're going to reduce the mining rate there by about 50% to better match our supply and - the supply and current market conditions. In the Americas, we've reduced capital by $500 million and that included the capital associated with our innovation initiatives that we previously estimated at $150 million of capital in 2020 that would add production as we go forward. We have suspended that project, but we're still using the data analytics tools and the agile way of working to drive cost performance and other things like recoveries and initiatives that do not require significant capital. We believe these tools will be very useful to us. As we drive efficiency. We'll use them rather than driving higher production levels, we'll use them to manage costs and improve our recoveries in our Americas mines. In Indonesia, our mine plans are basically the same as our prior plans. We incorporated updated market rates for energy and the favorable impacts of the stronger dollar on our foreign-denominated labor costs. We also tightened our belt to reduce spending in a number of areas throughout the operation. Now have combined these savings, reduced costs in Indonesia by about 10% for 2020. We also benefit from a higher gold price, which our prior plan was based on $1,500 gold, and we've adjusted this plan to $1,600 gold. And as you know, gold is currently over $1,700 per ounce today. Our capital spending in Indonesia was reduced by over $200 million in 2020. About half of this is the timing of installation of planned mill upgrades, which we deferred by a year as a result of the pandemic and current constraints on international contractors. We've also reduced spending forecasts associated with the proposed smelter in Indonesia that Richard referred to earlier as a result of project delays and the current discussions with the Indonesian government. Looking at Slide 25, and this is also in our press release. It's a financial summary of the revised plan for 2020 compared to the January plan that we prepared in conjunction with our earnings call in late January. Because of the sequencing of our mine plans during the year, we expected the first quarter to be the weakest of the year. We also expect, under the current plan, for capital expenditures to exceed our operating cash flows in the second quarter. But as you can see here on the slide, we expect our operating cash flows for the full 9-month period in the balance of this year to exceed capital expenditures by $400 million. And that's a $200 million improvement in cash flows for the full year compared to our previous plan despite a $0.50 decline in assumed average copper prices. In addition to the cost and capital reductions, our plan reflects a number of cash flow benefits associated with reductions in materials and supplies inventories, an acceleration of tax refunds and a series of other items to improve our cash flow. Importantly, we boosted liquidity during the year compared to our prior plans, and our net debt is lower. Richard mentioned, we've gone through a process of stress testing these plans at various prices and believe we have a plan that will bridge us through 2020 and put us in a strong position as we enter 2021 with the addition of large scale, low-cost volumes from Grasberg. Turning to Slide 26. We show our sales outlook for 2020 through 2022. As you'll note in this slide, the sales volumes are about 400 million pounds per annum, lower than our previous estimates. This reflects the curtailments that we're making in the Americas, reducing our mining rates. And it also includes a small change in 2022 associated with the deferral of the upgrade of the mill project, which has a slight impact on our mine plan for the ramp-up of the Deep MLZ. You see the gold sales are similar to our prior levels. There's a small change in 2022 related to the timing of the mill upgrade. Molybdenum sales are down about 10% from our prior estimates, and that reflects the change at the Climax mine and also the reduction in byproduct moly resulting from mine plan changes in our Americas copper mines. On Slide 27, we present a summary by region of our unit net cash costs. We separated the first quarter from the rest of the year so you can see the impacts of our actions. Net unit cash costs on a consolidated basis in the first quarter were $1.90 per pound. This was better than our plan, which projected about just over $2 in the first quarter. And our first quarter was expected in the original plan to be our highest in the year. But as you'll see, what we've done with our cost structure in the balance of the year is driving a significant decline in net unit cash costs compared with the first quarter. Cash costs in the 9-month average would be $1.44 per pound. That is $0.46 a pound or 24% below the first quarter average. We expect to average for the year, $1.55, taking into account the first quarter results and move to a unit cost level of about $1.20 per pound in 2021. We show at the bottom of the page, the makeup of our cost by region. You can see energy on these pie charts, which includes diesel and electrical power. And that represents, combined, the diesel and other sources of energy, 17% of our consolidated costs. Diesel represents about 8% and our diesel prices have declined more than 50% since the start of 2020. Moving to Slide 28, and you've seen us present EBITDA and operating cash flow in this format over many quarters. But it's designed to show at various prices what our EBITDA and cash flow generating capacity is using the average volumes and costs for 2021 and 2022. We hold gold flat in this scenario at $1,600 per ounce and molybdenum at $9 per pound and vary the copper prices for 2021 and 2022 between $2.50 and $3. And you can see here, we would generate a $2.50 copper, over $5 billion in EBITDA and over $3 billion of operating cash flow. And as prices move, we could generate over $7 billion at $3 copper and over $4.5 billion of operating cash flows. We present sensitivities on the right side of the chart, so you can make your own adjustments as to different copper market or gold market outlooks. We expect, as Richard was talking about, to manage our situation from a financial standpoint in 2020. Before getting into 2021, we will generate - we expect to generate very significant increases in cash margins and cash flow. We've cut spending. I'm now on Slide 29. So these cash flows that we generate will be available to fund CapEx and also have excess cash flows for other initiatives, including debt reductions and other initiatives that we have. We cut CapEx from $2.8 billion to $2 billion, and we show the details of where that came from. For 2021, we're currently estimating $2.3 billion in capital expenditures. That's about $100 million lower than our prior estimate. The focus of our plans to date, our revised plans to date, have been mainly on capital expenditures in 2020. We're continuing to review 2021. And we're reviewing those for potential additional reductions depending on market conditions, which we'll be evaluating in the coming months. Our plans, appropriately cut spending and capital and again, preserving the strong outlook that we have over the next several years. I'll just close on our financial policy that we covered throughout the call. We remain focused on safeguarding our people and our business, and maintaining strong liquidity and balance sheet strength as we manage uncertainty during the pandemic and the economics - associated economic impacts. Under current market conditions and priorities, our Board does not expect to declare dividends in 2020. This will be evaluated on a regular basis. And as we successfully execute our plans and enter 2021, we expect to be in a much stronger position with increased cash flow, enhanced flexibility to consider shareholder returns. Thanks for your attention today. And operator, we'd now like to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Alex Hacking : Good morning Richard and Kathleen, and hope you guys are staying safe and doing well. let me ask a couple of questions on Grasberg, if that's okay. The first question would be, how are the supply chains holding up there? Are you able to get access to the consumables and other things that you need? Or are you having to run down stockpiles? And then I guess, secondly, on Grasberg. Congratulations on all the steps that you're taking there to keep everyone safe. But in a worst-case scenario where there is a significant outbreak, what is the contingency plan? I mean, it's obviously very difficult to kind of safely halt underground mining there. So maybe you could discuss a little bit what the contingency would be in a worst-case scenario. Thank you very much. Richard Adkerson : Okay. Thank you for your question. Mark Johnson, would you comment? Mark is actually in Papua now at Grasberg. Can you comment on the supply chain issues and how we're dealing with it? Mark Johnson : Yes. To date, we haven't had any problems. Nothing's been interrupted. We're - we always have to maintain a supply up in the highlands. But no issues on - obviously, we have a large community up here. That's one of our concerns, but no problem. Like some of the places in the states, we haven't had a run on any of our grocery stores, our medical supplies, all those key things, plus all the things that we're doing for production and for our development, we haven't had any issues. On the contingency plans. One of the things that we've looked at in a worst-case scenario, as you mentioned, is the mines that we'd be - need to have some consideration. At Big Gossan, we could shut off and turn on if we needed to. It's a stope mine. But we've got - we work with our consultants and we understand what sort of minimum draw rates we would need in our block caves to keep them going. We could drop our personnel dramatically and to just do that minimum draw. For instance, in the Deep MLZ, right now, we run 8 loaders, about the same in the GBC. That's our core production. So the core production is a relatively small amount of people and equipment. A lot of our effort is in the continued expansion, the construction to achieve those out years that we've got. So it's an ongoing process. Our contingency plan in the worst-case scenario would be to minimize those activities and focus on the production activities. Operator : Your next question is from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. David Gagliano : Hi, thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the comprehensive update, the quick actions, the cost improvements, the cash savings, everything that you highlighted today. Clearly, you've been through this before. My question is regarding the out years. It looks to me, on my side, like a 2021 and 2022 reductions in copper volumes are mainly tied to the AI initiative CapEx cut, at least for North America. So my question, just to verify, do the '21 and 2022 copper volume targets assume that the North American operations are back up and running at normal rates? Or does it assume they continue to operate at the roughly 20% lower rate? And under what underlying market conditions do you plan to ramp those operations back up to normal again? Kathleen Quirk : Dave, it's Kathleen. Our mining rates that we have put in here, the 20% reduction in 2020, continues into part of 2021. We have some mines that are starting to ramp up, but we still have idled production during that period of time. So when we were pursuing in our previous plans, the initiatives, we were calling America's concentrator where we were increasing both mining rates and milling rates. We're not doing that at this point. So we could, if market conditions were to improve dramatically, and we'd have to take a long, hard look at that because, as you know, this is not a light switch that can go on and off. But we could start bringing back production and - over time and increase our mining and milling rates again. So this assumes that we remain in a curtailed mode at most of the - really all the operations through the first part of next year. And then some of the operations are increasing mining rates and others aren't. So it's a mixed bag, but we could. There's nothing about our prior plans that would stop us from increasing production. It may delay but because of the mining rate change this year, it may delay the timing to get to those volumes. But as we talked about, the volumes are still there and could be added over time if market conditions warrant. David Gagliano : Okay. And just as a related follow-up, just can you give us a sense as to when you say if market conditions warrant, is there - what's the market condition that would warrant a full... Kathleen Quirk : Well, our prior plan at the beginning of the year was based on the context of a copper market of $2.75 to $3. And as Richard was saying, the things - the ground work was in place for potentially higher prices as we go forward. So I think you'd have to see prices move back to those levels and have more economic certainty around the economy. But we're going to be very disciplined about executing these plans, really focused on costs, really focused on capital in the near term to make sure that we can preserve our financial position during 2020. And then as we get into 2021, we can start looking beyond at what the market conditions are and whether we restore full mining operations at that point. Richard Adkerson : And Dave, realistically, this situation is not likely to turn on at one point. Different countries are going to be in different situations. And things will occur step-by-step, and there will be uncertainties along the way. So it would be fair to say that given our overriding objective of protecting the long-term values of our assets, we will be very measured on how we respond. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Chris Terry : I just had a follow-on to David's question just now. So Slide 26, just on the production. Understand North America, I think that was probably reasonably we were flagged that there might be adjustments there. But in terms of South America, appreciate Cerro Verde is offline currently. The 2021, 2022 impact of South America, can you just talk through that? I know you have a little bit of leaching on Cerro Verde. Is that the carryover effect of less mining into 2021? Or is that - what exactly is happening there? I'm just trying to think about how you could maybe increase that if, again, maybe back to copper conditions, but just trying to understand the mechanics of 2021 in particular. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. Well, we've also reduced production at El Abra. We deferred a significant capital item there. And so we're reducing our mining rate at El Abra, and that's also contributing to the lower production in South America. But we do show - under our plans, we do show Cerro Verde production increasing in 2021 from the 2020 levels. But our El Abra mine is about flat like it was in 2020 when you compare it. So that's a significant reduction from our prior plans. Chris Terry : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. Just one more, if I may. I just wanted to follow up on the comments on the smelter. So the concept is still the kind of $3.5 billion level, but you just pushed back 2020, but you're still working out exactly negotiations on that. Is that the right way to think about it? Thanks. Kathleen Quirk : Richard, do you want me to take that one? Richard Adkerson : Well, let me ask you to repeat the question. Unfortunately, I had a little static in my line here. Chris Terry : Sure. No, I just wanted to just be - a little bit more detail on the smelter in terms of the concept. I think what you're saying is it's still kind of the $3.5 billion. You're just going to push out 2020, and you're in the process of renegotiating it. I just wanted to understand that, that was correct. Richard Adkerson : So I wouldn't characterize it as a renegotiation. We reluctantly decided that we would have to commit to build the smelter in order to get a resolution of the long-standing issues we've had with the government of Indonesia about extending our operating rights. And that was one key concession that we made along with facilitating the government through a state-owned company, acquiring 51% of the shares. That, as you know, was achieved principally by Rio Tinto deciding to sell their joint venture interest to the government. Of course, in return, we got clear-cut operating rights, fixed fiscal and financial terms to 2041 and established a positive new working relationship with the government. So we've made that commitment to the government, and we're executing on that commitment. The facts are we can't proceed as we have planned because of the worker restrictions at Gresik where the smelter relocated and supply chain issues with contractors and the like. In the meantime, the government in Indonesia, like governments around the world, are struggling with state revenues because of lower economic activity and investments. So we are engaging with the government as to whether this new circumstance might provide a way that would be mutually advantageous for the government, for our MIND ID, through PT-FI to reconsider what we're doing with the smelter. But throughout all this, we are being clear-cut that we made this commitment to the government. And unless the government agrees to some changes, which the current circumstances might lead them to consider, we are proceeding with fulfilling our commitment to build a smelter. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Carlos De Alba : Hopefully, everyone has been fine. So my question is first on working capital. The company generated cash flow from working capital reduction or lower levels of working capital in Q1. How do you see that going forward during the remainder of the year? And the second question, if I may, is regarding the positive surprise for the second quarter in a row in terms of gold production or shipments out of Indonesia. Can you maybe provide a little bit more color as to what is going on there? And if there is - this is something that maybe you have room to continue to surprise to the outside? Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Okay. With respect to the working capital question, we are projecting a large working capital source in 2020. As we mentioned, that is one of our initiatives here, to release cash from the balance sheet through the materials. As we curtail mining operations, we'll have the ability to use existing inventories as opposed to having to buy new consumables to a certain degree. So we'll have a reduction in materials and supplies. We're also bringing forward some tax refunds that were projected over the next several years, and we're bringing those forward into 2020. And there are a number of other cash flow initiatives that we have developed over the last several weeks in the context of our revised plans. And so we are showing a large source of working capital throughout the year. Carlos De Alba : Kathleen, if I may. So this will continue in Q2, Q3, above and beyond what we saw already in Q1 then? Kathleen Quirk : Right. Yes. Richard Adkerson : Let me just add that, again, complementing people. Kathleen and her team has done a great job with financing. Steve Higgins, who heads up our administrative team is doing an excellent job in managing worker issues and HR and other matters. Danny Hughes, who heads up our global supply team, is doing a fabulous job. And we have tremendously positive relationships with our suppliers. We are often one of their largest customers, in many cases, the largest customer. And so as we face this problem, we sit down with our suppliers, and we're able to find ways to reduce costs, deal with payment terms and the like. Same way with our customers. We all understand each other's problems. We worked together many years. Some of this you're seeing is a result of all those long-term relationships, but also how diligent our whole team is being in finding ways, I said we left no stone unturned, in finding ways to generate cash, and we're going to continue to do that on an ongoing basis. Kathleen Quirk : In terms of the question on the gold. We did experience some higher grades and - of gold, and that will - we still are projecting that our grades are consistent with our plans. And you'll have pluses and minuses with how the grades are measuring against the plans. We did have some higher grades. And Mark, I don't know if you want to comment any further about gold grades and recoveries as we go forward. Richard Adkerson : Yes. I was going to add that, Kathleen, before Mark talked. Mark, I've been noting just how strong our recoveries have been and recoveries have been above plan in many respects. So maybe you could talk about that. Mark Johnson : Yes. In the first quarter, what we - the significant difference that we saw in grades in both copper and gold was in the Deep MLZ. We were essentially on or just above target as far as the tonnes. But for both the copper and gold grades, we were about 18% above plan. What's driving that is really, we're mining the Deep MLZ for the cave management. We've talked about the seismicity. And so we're very cognizant of how we pull the cave and it's - our intent is to draw it in a very even fashion, and we've got a great system now where we can track every single bucket, and we know exactly where each bucket of material came from. Just happened in the first quarter to manage the cave on a daily basis, the grades came out. Like Kathleen said, it was an advancement. It's not a change in our model. We just happen to be able to pull - by following the cave plan, we ended up with better grades. And those grades are quite good on both - the copper grade for Deep MLZ was at 1.9% copper and 1.9 gram per tonne gold. And the plan for both those were right in the 1.6 range. So that was a welcome surprise. Recoveries have been quite good. As Richard said, we've been - particularly, on copper, we were over 92% copper recovery. Obviously, these - our experience has been over the life of mining the Grasberg and the other ore bodies here, the better the grade, the better the recoveries, and that's been tracking well. As we mine these very high grades at Gras, at Deep MLZ and the grades at GBC are also very respectable and very high-grade deposit at Big Gossan. So we track well on that, and then we've been right in the 80% recovery range for the gold, which is very close to our expectations. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Chris LaFemina : Hi, Richard and Kathleen, thank you for taking my question. It's good to see the improvements in your balance sheet and liquidity over the last few years. Very different from what you looked like in 2015. And also good to see the operational flexibility. It looks like you are actually generating positive free cash flow at current spot prices, which is encouraging. My question relates to how some of the operational changes that you're making today might affect the long-term performance of your assets. I recall back in 2008, some mining companies revised their mine plans. They reduced their CapEx in response to low prices, which helped in the short term, but those changes led to an extended period of higher cost and higher sustaining CapEx. And I'm wondering if that's something that is likely to happen at Freeport? Or is it just that you are taking these short-term measures without necessarily jeopardizing the longer-term structural integrity of your assets? Richard Adkerson : Well, thanks, Chris. The word jeopardizing is not one that would be - that would apply here. But the effects of not spending some of this money now will carry over to future production levels because certain of the capital costs that we're deferring will have to be recovered in the future, and it will push out some production. But this will not, in any significant way, jeopardize the value, the resources because the resources are still there but it could - it will result in some delays of when that production occurs. You see that at Grasberg, where we are delaying spending on incremental crushing capacity at the mill for the time being, and that will have an impact. What we'll do is update you each quarter as we go through this and get better views of it. But again, it's not a question of destroying resources but there will be some impact on future timing. Let me ask Red. Red, do you have a comment on this? Red Conger : Yes. Richard, you're absolutely correct. And just one specific example would be El Abra that Kathleen mentioned earlier that we're slowing down the production right there in order to push out capital expenditures and a new leach pad that's required for future production. So when things look up, we'll make that investment and be able to increase the volumes there if markets warrant. Chris LaFemina : As a follow-up, sorry. Kathleen Quirk : The other thing I would just add, Red's team is very strong with all of the operations that during this downturn, we're not going to compromise safety. We're not going to be cannibalizing equipment. We're going to keep the equipment that we are using in good condition. It's just that we're not using all of our equipment. So we're postponing what we need to do in terms of rebuilding and things to meet a higher mining plan. But we're not doing things that don't - we aren't doing things that would destroy asset value, and Red keeps preaching that to the team. So I just wanted to add that. Chris LaFemina : As a follow-up, it will be, I suppose, interesting to see whether companies that don't have liquidity, don't have positive cash flow and are taking actions to kind of protect their balance sheet. We'll have to do things that will lead to less production for an extended period of time. In other words, the question really is, well, do you think this leads ultimately, this downturn leads to an extended period of less than expected global copper production as a result of initiatives that companies are taking today to protect themselves? In which case, we can have higher prices in an upturn than we would have had otherwise? Richard Adkerson : No question about that. I think the feature that was most supportive of copper prices is the supply situation in copper. Supply was going to be tested in any event before all this happened. And now, with development projects being delayed, curtailments occurring, which is we just spoke about, has some impact. And as you say, Chris, we know what it's like to be a company where you don't have flexibility with liquidity. That's where we were in 2016. And as a result, we had to sell assets beyond copper, but also some copper assets. So this is - depending on severity and the link of this lasting, there's going to be a longer run impact on copper supplies, and that will ultimately be supporting the prices. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Oscar Cabrera with CIBC. Oscar Cabrera : Thank you, operator and good morning everyone. Richard, I just wanted to explore a little bit more the cost reduction that your team did. And by the way, congratulations to the team on a quick turnaround. Something that took less than - in a few weeks, whereas a lot of the mining companies are not providing this level of detail. So your site production and delivery costs with your original plan was about $2.04 a pound. This was now reduced to $1.80. I was wondering if you could provide us with an estimate of how much lower can this go. And you talked about diesel costs being lower as well as getting help from a - depreciating exchanges around the world. So I was wondering if you could provide just a ballpark estimate of what percentage of that accounted for the reduction. Kathleen Quirk : Oscar, this is Kathleen. So it was a combination of many things. But in the Americas, we removed production. So that flows through all the costs, all the mining and labor costs. And so that had an effect on removing all of the cost of production associated with those pounds. We also benefited from lower energy costs, which was about $0.07 a pound compared to our prior forecast. Energy costs are lower than when we prepared this forecast. They're down probably another 15%, 20% from the time we prepared this forecast. But from a long-term perspective, we're using about $1 per gallon of diesel in these forecasts. And that had about a $0.07 impact on the Americas cost. Of course, in the U.S., our currencies, it's all a U.S. dollar business. Where we really saw the benefit of the currency impact was in Indonesia. And as I mentioned, that reduced our cost by - the absolute cost of energy plus the currency benefits by about 10% in Indonesia. And the big driver in Indonesia, though, is the volume aspect, and that's really what's going to drive our cash costs lower. But as you've seen, we reduced our - we were previously estimating over the next 5 years, about $0.30 a pound for production costs in Indonesia, and we're now using roughly $0.20 a pound for those costs, and that reflects some savings in the cost structure that we've been driving over many months, not just because of the COVID and the economic situation. But as we transitioned out of Grasberg into the underground, we've been - Mark and his team have been leading a zero-based budgeting process to bring overall costs down in Indonesia. Oscar Cabrera : But I mean, year-end 2020, if need be, could cost be reduced further, i.e., there - are there other sources you could use like cutting more production to lower the $1.80 that you're showing now? Kathleen Quirk : I think what we're doing really is looking at what's cash flow positive. And so we look down at cutting production further. At $2 copper, that may not make sense. But we'll iterate on that some more as we go forward. But if you really look into our second half cash costs at $2 copper, our Americas business is generating cash flow. And so prices would have to decline substantially for us to take it down further. But you noted how quickly we moved here, and we're continuing to evaluate, to be flexible to have a flexible operating structure regardless of prices. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. John Tumazos : Thank you very much for taking my question and for your service to the company. Concerning the exciting antimicrobial properties of copper, for weaving into linens and masks and things, I guess that would use wire rod and wire products consistent with infrastructure. But for countertops, tables, chairs, restaurant, public applications, it would need sheet. And there's a very limited amount of foil or strip and electronics and a very limited architectural roofing applications. Would you be willing to contribute capital for a sheet rolling mill or a JV with other copper producers or fabricators or apply for stimulus money, which the government might grant to get the supply going? It could be a multimillion tonne market. Richard Adkerson : John, we've lost part of your question. I think I understand your question. John Tumazos : Do you want to build a hot strip mill for copper sheet? Richard Adkerson : I think the more likely thing - the way forward with that is for our company, and hopefully, I feel confident, other companies will join us, is to provide the technical basis for these things and then to work with entrepreneurs, venture capital firms and so forth to develop these new industries. We tried this in the past and we ran into barriers because of the cost of refitting and so forth. Now the world has changed and people are seeing this. And this flood of articles is coming out, telling the truth about copper. So we think that will create a market, and we will be working with the industry as a company to help promote this going forward. I think there would be some likelihood for government support of entrepreneurial-type companies. Going forward, our primary focus is going to continue to be in developing and operating mines. But we will - we've already begun talking and developing a team to see how we might help lead this movement to doing something that - positive for copper markets, of course, but more importantly, would be positive for the world because these impacts of health protection are real. And we just see how much they are needed in today's world. And even before that, the number of infections that people get going to hospitals for surgeries and things like knee replacements that occur because of infections from hospitals is staggering. So this is just bringing to light a contribution that copper as a metal can make the world. And we are going to be a leader in demonstrating that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley FBR. Lucas Pipes : Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on a very impressive response to this - especially under these very difficult circumstances. I wanted to follow up to Chris' question earlier on trade-offs between today's cuts and future production. Is there a way to maybe quantify in a little bit more detail what the impact to production could look like for the Americas, call it, starting around 2023? Richard Adkerson : Well, it's just too early to do that. I mean, we're in a period of uncertainty right now. Our focus has been on bridging from the loss of cash flows from the lower copper price to ensure that we could bridge our company to the higher volumes from Grasberg. And so that's what we're doing with this plan. We're going to focus on executing this plan. For any of us to sit here today and be able to predict where the world is going to be any period of time even in the short run, there's huge uncertainties. And beyond that, there are as well. So we're just not in a position right now to say what we're going to do. But I think what you can get comfort in is that we have the flexibility of addressing to whatever the world has. We have a track record of doing that. You can look and see what we did beginning in 2010, 2011, what we did in 2016, '17 and see how we did it, and that's what we're going to keep working on. So this is an unfolding story, work in process. But as a company, we have a lot of flexibility in dealing with whatever comes down the road, positive or negative. Kathleen Quirk : And right now, our plans show pretty flat going out to that point over the next 5 years for Americas. But as Richard said, it's going to be dynamic as we assess the situation going forward. Lucas Pipes : Yes. I understand. I appreciate the color. And again, I think you've done a really great job responding to this unanticipatable environment here. Second question, just in terms of your relative cost position and the industry response. Obviously, there's been a lot of supply being taken offline to safety concerns and precautions. Do you anticipate - first, what's kind of - what's your relative cost position today? And then do you anticipate a broader supply response from the copper miners due to the decline in prices? Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Well, we have mines that range in cost structures from the lowest end of the industry to mines that are relatively high cost because of the nature of the portfolio we put together years ago when we combined Grasberg with Phelps Dodge portfolio of assets. And by having these assets together is what enables us to reduce mines that are relatively low margin during good times and generate profits and extend resources with having the ability to scale back production when prices are low. And that was the huge issue that Phelps Dodge faced years ago, and the strategic benefit we achieved by putting these sets of assets together. So we can calculate an average as a company and compare that average with other companies. But when we manage the business, the management is focused on site-by-site. And so what you're seeing here today is a layering of actions to reduce high cost production, drive our costs down. And even within areas of mines like Morenci, there are elements of production within that large mine that get adjusted and others do not. So there's no - the average is calculated, but the management is managed site-by-site. Kathleen Quirk : I think the other thing to add here is we benefit from having very long life reserves. And when you're looking at - aside from the Grasberg reinvestment - investment program we're making right now, once we get into production at Grasberg, CapEx will decline. You'll be generating a lot of free cash flow. But also in the Americas, we have a very long life reserve base and additional resources. So when you look at the cash cost plus the CapEx, and you think about, we're not having to spend a lot of CapEx to replace reserves because we've got such a long reserve profile. And we don't have the reinvestment risk that some other short life mines might have. So when we look at this and when we went through this plan with Red and the Americas team, we were really looking at what is the cash cost less the capital that comes with it? And sometimes, when you're trying to build production and grow, you've got a lot of capital that comes with that. And so right now, we're operating on the plan to have as lower cash costs but also what is the lowest cash cost plus capital expenditures that makes sense for us right now. And that's really the plan we're focused on. Operator : Now we will turn the call over to management for any closing remarks. Richard Adkerson : Well, it's been a long call. I appreciate your attention. I think the length of this call is warranted because of the uncertainties we face, and we wanted to make sure that we did our best to try to explain to you what we're doing with the company. As you can tell, we're more than pleased with where we are in a very difficult and uncertain situation. Our guard is up. We're not going to let down at all because none of us are quite sure what else we might have to deal with. And so thank you for your attention. If you have follow-up questions, or comments, please get in touch with David Joint, and we'll respond to them. I hope all of you stay healthy and your families and friends can do so as well. It's time to be reflective about what this situation is doing to so many people around the world, and our hearts and prayers go out to everyone. Thank you a lot. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

On the call today is Richard Adkerson, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Red Conger is on the call, as well as Mark Johnson; Steve Higgins, Rick Coleman and Mike Kendrick . I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard who will be going through the presentation materials. As usual, after our prepared remarks, we'll open the call up for questions. Today FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $53 million, or $0.03 per share in the second quarter of 2020. The results included net credits of $9 million or roughly $0.01 per share, primarily associated with favorable metals inventory adjustments and an income tax credit, and those were mostly offset by COVID-19-related costs and employee separation programs. Adjusted net income after these special items totaled $44 million or $0.03 per share in the second quarter. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation for the second quarter totaled $754 million. That was above our July 6 estimate of approximately $650 million, primarily reflecting slightly higher sales volumes in the quarter and lower costs than our prior estimates. A reconciliation of our EBITDA is available on slide 38 of our side deck. Copper sales during the second quarter were 759 million pounds. That was about 10% higher than our April, 2020 estimate. And that reflected better than anticipated production rates in Indonesia and North America, and the timing of shipments from Cerro Verde. Our second quarter gold sales of 184,000 ounces were 12% higher than our April 2020 estimate, reflecting a strong performance in Indonesia. The average realized copper price during the quarter for copper was $2.55 per pound. That was below the year ago quarterly average of $2.75 per pound. And gold realized prices averaged $1,749 per ounce during the second quarter, above last year's second quarter of $1,351 per ounce. Consolidated average unit net cash costs averaged $1.47 per pound in the second quarter of 2020. That was lower than a year-ago quarter and also lower than our April 2020 estimate of a $1.63 per pound, reflecting the higher copper and gold sales volumes and strong execution of our cost reduction initiatives. We generated strong cash flows during the quarter, totaling $491 million in cash flows from operations and funded capital expenditures, totaling $527 million during the period. We ended the quarter with consolidated debt, totaling $9.9 billion and consolidated cash totaled $1.5 billion, with strong liquidity and no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Richard who will be referring to our slide presentation materials. Richard, please go ahead. Richard Adkerson : Okay. Thank you, Kathleen. And good morning to each of you, and we appreciate you participating in our call today. Hope you and your families are staying well and safe. This has been a very trying time over the past four months. Work has been intense. Life is challenging. I'm pleased that our team has shown the discipline preserver. [Ph] We faced lots of problems, but I want to say that this quarterly report as we previewed earlier is really a good news for our Freeport team and the great work we\u2019ve been doing. I'll refer to the slides and going to slide 3. At Freeport, we are of course continuing to prioritize the health and safety of our workers, and we're also working hard to support communities where we operate as we serve our customers with their ongoing requirements for copper. In late April, we laid out a comprehensive plan to share with our stakeholders at that time to describe how we were going to manage the COVID-19 health and economic issues, keep our people safe and how we were going to safeguard our business to protect the value of our assets for what we are convinced will be a very-positive long-term future. Since that time, over the past three months, I've been extremely proud of our Freeport team for the way they responded to this plan and this crisis in a very short period, making tough decisions during the height of this unprecedented crisis, and more importantly, how our team is executing these plans safely with a spirit of commitment and cooperation. We have had a real sense of urgency in implementing these plans. We moved very quickly to reduce costs and capital spending. And you can see this in our second quarter results and our annual guidance that we're providing today. Our management and healthcare -- worker healthcare today has been affected. Pleased that in addition to manage these health issues, our team has also achieved strong safety performance during the quarter. And that's particularly gratifying because of our concerns as people might be distracted, but that's not been the case. We have been able to produce safely our products, using strict operating protocols, distancing, enhancing protective equipment for our workers, sanitation, and particularly significant investments in testing and tracing isolated, infected people and treating those that are sick. We've actually had only a handful of people to be seriously sick and the vast majority of the people that have encountered the disease today have recovered. Many have not had any symptoms. But that's not deterred us from going forward with this program to protect their safety. Our workforce is adhering to global health standards. We're making sure everyone focuses on their own personal safety and the wellbeing of people around them. We are continuing and enhancing and responding to these protocols as we go forward. Our global team of workers is of course critical to our Company's success. And we recognize and I personally appreciate the dedication, commitment and their cooperation during this challenging time. Other than government imposed restrictions at Cerro Verde, there have only been very limited impacts from the pandemic at our operating sites. But knowing just how fast this virus can spread, we remain diligent and steadfast in protecting people. As I said in April, we laid out our plans to address our business and boost liquidity in what was then a very weak and volatile market environment. As a reminder, we laid out our plan to reduce costs and capital spending in 2020 by over $2 billion, the reduction of about 15% of our planned copper production, totaling about 400 million pounds, an aggressive management of all costs, including G&A and exploration. Our execution of this plan has been very effective. You see that in our second quarter results, which are better than the revised forecast. Our sales volume exceeded our April guidance about 10% for copper, 12% for gold, all achieved very safely in the face of this global crisis. Our team maintained focus, drive and came together to meet the challenges as we've done [Technical Difficulty] in the past at Freeport. Copper prices have improved dramatically during the quarter. Our plan was based in April on a $2.30 per pound copper price and we had contingencies for much lower prices. Even though prices are higher, we are staying the course, remaining disciplined and executing our cost containment plans. We\u2019re convinced this is prudent in light of the uncertainties and dynamic nature of the ongoing pandemic. We're not letting down our guard at all or taking any victory laps. We're more focused than ever as an organization to drive long-term values that we see in our assets. In a few seconds, I'll be reporting more in detail on the progress our team has made at Grasberg. The team there continues to shine in its operations, and it's really key to our long-term strategy. We are on schedule and ramping up to deliver large, low-cost, sustainable production, volume of copper and gold for years to come. The team has consistently been meeting or beating forecasts. That's been our situation for several quarters. Now, I'm pleased to report that we're on track with our ramp up plan. And I also want to especially acknowledge the Cerro Verde team for their exceptional work during this quarter to restore operations at our site near Arequipa in Peru. We've worked very closely with the Peruvian government and the local authorities. We developed a safe plan for return to operations at Cerro Verde. By June, we were operating at 80% of our 2019 rates. We're continuing to increase productivity with protocols that protect workers in the community surrounding Arequipa. The Lone Star project in Eastern Arizona advanced during the quarter on schedule and that is now being commissioned. We also continued to build flexibility in our balance sheet, through extending maturities at attractive rates. We're working with our bank group to provide enhanced downside protection to maintain liquidity through our bank credit facility. All of this has effectively safeguarded our business, allowed us to navigate this period of uncertainty and retain the massive upside we see in our asset that is now increasingly close to being in front of us. Our Company benefits from a major way from having an extraordinary long life and durable reserve base and resource space, premier position in copper, which has a compelling long-term outlook and significant exposure to gold markets. And I'm confident that continued strong execution will make these assets even more valuable to our shareholders in the future. Now, turning to slide 4. We talk about our commitment to our communities. This has been longstanding on wavering. Communities are home for our workers and their families. They're essential to our long-term success. Across the gold, we supported communities here in this time with much of the medical supplies, food, monetary support. In many respects, dealing with COVID is bringing us closer to communities -- bringing us closer communities, where we operate to fight a common cold. Our people are stepping up to help communities to meet this growing need. And as a company, we're continuing to find ways to make a difference. On slide 5, we talk about our commitment to all stakeholders. Our focus is on our shareholders of course, but equally on our workers, communities and environment. And this has been embedded in Freeport\u2019s culture for many years. We cannot be successful in generating long-term value for shareholders, unless we address sustainability issues appropriately. In fact, we learned that many years ago. While this commitment is being highlighted through our actions in response to the COVID pandemic, in our recent report -- published annual report and sustainability, which you can find on our website, summarizes all of our programs in this important area. I'm pleased to note, we've recently published our first climate report, which details our efforts to-date and our plans to address climate-related risks and opportunities to go forward. And of course, copper is going to play a key role broadly in dealing with carbon reduction and as the world focuses more on climate issues. As I mentioned and shown on slide 6, copper prices have recovered sharply from the lows in March. We're now back to the point where they were earlier in the year at the height of the crisis. Speaking candidly, this recovery came sooner and stronger than we and others anticipated, similarly to what we saw in 2009-2010. China's economy is recovering strongly and steadily from the first quarter low, being led by its industrial sector, infrastructure spending and the government's actions to stimulate the Chinese economy. Around the world, ongoing monetary and physical stimulus is helping to offset the negative economic downturn from COVID. We're beginning to see a restart in the global economies. We're also seeing some positive signs as businesses reopen in the western world, particularly with automobile production beginning to improve. Supplies of copper during this COVID pandemic have been affected, both mine supply and scrap availability are lower. Notably, inventories have remained low and have actually moved even lower in recent months. Now, this is very notable because it's not typical of past commodity downturns. Typically, in downturns, inventories rise and then have to be worked off when recovery occurs. Currently low inventories are a good omen for copper as it positions the metal for material gains as economic activity rebounds. Now, having said this, we at Freeport are cognizant of the risk of current uncertainties. We will continue to operate our business prudently until there's clarity. As economies around the world recover and improve, copper will be a major benefit. And prices are still well-below what is needed to incentivize investments and new projects, which results in a tight market as we go forward. Slide 7, we show how to become clearly and more widely acknowledged that copper's importance in a global economy will be key to achieving decarbonization initiatives, that will require greater intensity for the use of copper. Copper is strongly supported by fundamentals as an essential metal in the overall global economy. And as the economy recovers and the world grows, more copper will be needed. But, momentum is growing in efforts to reduce carbon around the world. I'm personally convinced this is going to be a mandate for all companies and governments, mandate by people as we go forward. From electric vehicles and charging stations to 5G and other technical applications, all of this is driven by electronics, and electronics require copper. Copper is essentially not only in times when the economy is growing, but also times like these when healthcare, water and food supply, communication and technology, critically important. Telecommunications, digital technologies, cloud applications have never been more important than in today's world. The current pandemic is bringing to light what copper can achieve in improving global health. Studies have demonstrated that copper can destroy viruses like COVID-19. Use in healthcare equipment, facilities, public places will undoubtedly grow significantly. Our Company, Freeport is foremost in copper. Copper is widely considered the best position major commodity from a supply-demand standpoint. And Freeport will be a major beneficiary of these trends. Now, beginning on slide eight, I'll give you a brief update on our operations and projects. At Cerro Verde, its production was impacted during the quarter by the government order, which restricted operating rights for Cerro Verde and other mines in Peru. Our Cerro Verde team is doing terrific work in working with the government and our workforce, and implementing protocols to demonstrate to the government and our workers that we can operate safely. During the quarter, we managed to increase rates from about a third of capacity to about 80% of 2019 levels. Our current plans assume we operate at about 350,000 tons per day through the mill for the balance of the year. We will continuously monitor conditions in the region and work to increase rates over time. We have demonstrated in the past that the modern concentrator complex at Cerro Verde, the largest in the world, copper industry, can produce at rates over 400,000 metric tons per day. Cerro Verde has been a large contributor to the local economy, one of the largest employers in the region, has a bright long term future. Cerro Verde is simply a great long term asset for Freeport. Now, for the good stuff. At Grasberg, I'm very pleased to report of the positive progress on our underground ramp-up. For several quarters now, our team has consistently been meeting or beating expectations. And this quarter\u2019s progress is particularly noteworthy in light of doing this with having to manage the impact of the pandemic. Combined production from our two major mines, the Grasberg Block Cave and the Deep MLZ mine averaged nearly 55,000 tons of ore per day. This is ahead of our forecast, and almost 50% above the first quarter of this year. By the end of the quarter, we were producing 70,000 tons of ore per day, containing high grades of copper and gold, and we expect to exit 2020 at 95,000 tons per day. We added 46 new drawbells during the quarter. These are the rock funnels that are used to collect ore simultaneously which add scale. We now have 260 drawbell locations and growing these. Infrastructure is in place. What we're doing now is basic Block Cave mining, advancing the cave front, building drawbells and commencing production. On slide 9, we show a new chart this quarter to illustrate the pace of our underground production ramp-up. The annualized run rate in the second quarter, this is really notable is now at about close to 50% of the ultimate goal of producing an average of 1.55 billion pounds of copper and 1.6 million ounces of gold from the underground ore bodies. This is triple what we achieved a year ago. As indicated in the graph, we expect to average about 70% of the annual targeted run rate by the fourth quarter of this year, and by the end of 2021 be at 90% of the targeted run rates. We expect to continue to add new drawbells to allow us to increase production. Basically, we'll now continue to do what we now have been doing over the last several quarters. But, when this all down, it's straight forward that all of this is achievable because of the more than 15 years we've been investing in this program. Making the decision to continue this investment during our negotiations with Indonesian government of our contract, the investments we've made in developing the infrastructure, the technical expertise of our team and managing Block Cave and a social license we have earned in Grasberg position us over the many years, we've been there. We are now positioned for achieving this success that we've been pointing to for such a long period of time. But, we know better than anybody in the world the risk inherent in Block Cave mining and there are issues that we will face. But, the progress today demonstrates validity in our confidence. We've gone a long way in derisking the long-term plan. We recently achieved a major milestone, which was expected. The Grasberg Block Cave has now intersected the massive Grasberg open pit. This is a milestone. It was also a situation that we had to be prepared to manage because it evolved certain unknowns. Gratified to say that Mark Johnson and has team are dealing with this, and we don't perceive this as being a problem. And now, the massive Grasberg open pit will literally crumble into the Block Cave mine we're developing. The value creation from this transformation is truly magic. Notably, the gold benefit at Grasberg production has been and will be a major benefit with combined rates -- combined with rates of high grades of copper. At full production, Grasberg mine is the largest gold mine, even though the gold is a byproduct of the copper operations. The high grades of copper combined with this gold component make Grasberg one of the mining industry\u2019s truly most valuable fabulous asset in its history. As gold prices, approximate $1,800 an ounce, revenues from gold are projected to completely offset the total cost of production at Grasberg. EBITDA from this operation would average $4.5 billion to $5 billion a year at copper and gold prices. Really want to say and emphasize that our partnership with the government of Indonesia remains strong and I would say grow stronger every day. We're now fully aligned in our mutual objectives of creating values for all stakeholders. And what a much improved situation it is for all of us to be focused on developing and operating this asset and not to be sidetracked by dealing with contract issues, as we were for so long. I can't say enough about how pleased I am with the agreement we reached in December 2018 and how it's being operated. I want to say, as indicated in our April report, we continue to experience delays with the development of the proposed new smelter in the Gresik area of Eastern Java. We're continuing to do running planning and site work to a certain degree, but COVID is a real serious problem in the Gresik area, and it is delaying progress with this project, with workers and with contractors. We are continuing our discussions with the government regarding our request for a year's delay in completing the project. We are also engaged in discussing with partners and representatives of government alternative scenarios that would be true beneficial to the government and the PT-FI. These matters are currently under consideration, and we'll keep you informed of what happens with this. There's nothing easy about this project we're doing. It takes a world class team in terms of competency with years of experience, strong track record of success. This is a unique asset in a unique physical setting. We're meeting this challenge. We met the challenge of dealing with the unexpected seismic events with the Deep MLZ mine, with hydraulic fracking solution that is now working and is proving to be very effective. We are confident about our team's ability to meet these challenges and confident that going forward that the biggest risks we face are behind us. Slide 9 shows -- illustrates what I've been talking about in terms of the progress that we're making towards getting to our long-term goal, which we will subsequently reach by the end of just next year, 18 months from now. Many of you\u2019ll recall how we were talking about dealing with this 15 years ago, and now we're 18 months away. As I said, in terms of targeted production, we're at about 50% way there in terms of throughput from our two major mines. We are a third of the way there and moving forward. Slide 10 covered the smelter, which I've talked about. Slide 11, we talk about our Lone Star mine in Eastern Arizona. This is the mine as most of you know, that's directly adjacent to the Safford mine where we're using available production facilities as the Safford mine ages and has availability for capacity. It's just across the mountain range from Morenci in an area of the world that we're very well familiar with and very well accepted. Our progress at Lone Star was excellent in the quarter, commissioning work has begun. We are ramping up placement of ore on a newly constructed leach pad. At Safford, the pre-stripping we undertook to explore the ore is substantially behind us now. And we're setting up for the production phase at the beginning of this quarter, third quarter. Project capital of $825 million is largely behind us, technically a bit lower than the original budget. Initial project is forecasted at 200 million pounds of copper annually. We're evaluating exciting opportunities to increase production over time with low capital. This is a tremendous resource with great expansion opportunities. But for now, we're focused on optimizing the initial project. We'll turn to major expansions of Lone Star when market conditions warrant. Over the long term, this asset will be a significant future cornerstone asset for Freeport in the United States in our outlook. I want to point out the United States has major advantages for mining investments compared with other countries around the world in general. For our Company, there are no taxes in the far U.S. investments for many, many years to come. We pay no royalties because we own lands and fleet. Energy costs are lower. We have a flexible workforce with no unions. We now have an improved regulatory framework. Freeport has achieved through hard work, community and government support for our businesses, and in the United States benefits from a strong rule of law. Slide 12, we summarize the work we've been talking about over the past year that our Company has been doing with automation. We continue to leverage the technology tools we've developed to unlock bottlenecks, use machine learning, drive to have our best operating performance every hour of every day. We have reduced the budget for this initiative -- the spending budget for this initiative, but our teams continue to progress the work we started in 2018 and 2019, using internal resources with minimal capital investment. We continue to be encouraged by the power of these two, and the results we\u2019ve generated to-date. And I can say, the enthusiasm of our team for this initiative is very-high. Now, putting this altogether on slide 13, you will see that we're on a path to double our EBITDA from 2020 levels as we go forward. Execution of these plans now well underway, will allow us to grow copper volumes by over 20% in 2021, gold volumes by 75%, reduce our net unit cost by over 20% and significantly expand our margin and cash flows. Assuming an average of $2.70 copper for 2020, this takes into account the first year actual average in $285 million copper for the balance of the year. EBITDA would approximate $3.4 billion. This expands to $7 billion per year at $2.75 to $3 copper. Our gold revenues are expected to approximate $2.7 billion per year at $1,800 gold. So, you can see the very positive exposure we have to gold prices. Through our decisive actions announced in April for 2020, we have protected the downside, while we've retained the growth in cash flows for 2021 and beyond. That was the objective of the whole exercise. This combination of growing volumes with the potential -- has the potential to coincide with [Technical Difficulty] copper prices to enable us to strengthen our balance sheet and then returned to the day when we can provide significant cash returns to our shareholders. We at Freeport have all worked so hard to position our Company for this opportunity. And it's particularly gratifying now to see this firmly within our line of sight. Slide 14. I'm so proud of our organization and what we refer to internally as The Freeport Edge. Our management team has extensive experience in managing tough market environments. Leadership teams across our Company are seasoned battle-hardened. They have been effective and successful in past downturns. Each crisis is different, but in each of our past experiences, Freeport as a company has come out stronger. We have a management structure and a team that is collaborative, experienced and decisive. We never cut corners on important issues involving worker safety, environmental obligations, responsibilities to our communities, and commitments to governments. We keep a long-term focus on our license to operate around the world that we have worked so hard to earn. We've shown that we can adjust to market conditions quickly. We've done this on multiple occasions and we're doing it now. We\u2019ve developed contingency plans for further actions required to take this on a site by site basis. Value orientation is real hallmark of this Freeport organization. Freeport is foremost in copper in the industry. And copper is a great place to be. Freeport\u2019s portfolio of assets are large and high quality. We are an established an industry leader by developing and operating mines that are among the largest in the world. Our assets are long-lived and durable with embedded options for reserve and resource growth. We have strong franchises in the USA, South America and Indonesia. We have industry-leading technical capabilities through a strong track record of project execution demonstrated over many years. We've earned the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, our suppliers, financial markets, most importantly, our workers, communities, and host companies, where we operate. Really important that our Block Caving experience in our company is one of the most extensive and longstanding is the history of the global mining industry. We've been successfully operating Block Cave mines in Indonesia since the early 1980s. And we have an important molybdenum Block Caving operation in Colorado at our Henderson mine. This experience and capabilities and competency is critically important as we\u2019re introducing Grasberg with the largest Block Caving operation in the world. And I can tell you it's highly valued by our Indonesian partners. Our experience and battle-tested management has demonstrated the capabilities to perform in good times and in bads. We are confident in our ability to live with these plans safely and efficiently. Before turning the presentation back to Kathleen, I want to close by sincerely thanking all of our Freeport people. They inspire me every day. I want to recognize them for their strength and resiliency, their dedication and performance. I'm personally proud to be part of this team over all these years. I can tell you, we're all motivated and committed to persevering and achieving success for all of our stakeholders. Kathleen? Kathleen Quirk : Great. Thanks, Richard. And I'll just briefly review our financial outlook, beginning on slide 17, and then we'll take your questions. On slide 17, we're summarizing our sales outlook for 2020 through 2022. As Richard indicated, our global team is performing at a high level. We've increased our 2020 sales outlook by about 60 million pounds of copper and 50,000 ounces of gold, reflecting the strong second quarter performance. As reflected in the charts, our sales volumes estimates are expected to grow by over 20% in 2021 and 30% in 2022, compared to 2020 levels. Notably, volumes in 2022 are expected to increase by nearly 1 billion pounds of copper from 2020 levels. This reflects the projected addition of volumes from Grasberg as we move toward design capacity and the increased Cerro Verde volumes as we continue to restore full production levels. Our gold volumes, as I said, in 2020, are slightly above our prior estimates and are similar to the guidance that we provided for 2021 and 2022. For moly, we've adjusted the sales outlook slightly to better match our supply with current market conditions. We show on the next slide, slide 18, our volumes by quarter. And as you'll see, we're expecting a strong second half with sales increasing throughout the year. And you'll know, by the fourth quarter, we're very close to our 2021 run rate for annual volumes. Our teams remain very-focused on executing the plan safely and finishing the year strong. Turning to costs on the next slide, slide 19. You can see, we moved very quickly in March and April to adjust our cost structure. We modified our mine plans to reduce mining rates and to reduce higher cost production, and we successfully implemented a series of cost savings initiatives to drive long-term benefits. As Richard mentioned, in addition to the operating cost reductions, we also took steps to reduce overhead and exploration costs, and those initiatives were also successfully implemented during the second quarter. We reduced our North American mining rates in the second quarter by about 25%, compared to the year-ago quarter. We also reduced our contract labor significantly, and our team stepped up -- internal-team stepped up to fill in the gaps. We continue to effectively implement the cost containment programs that have been underway in Indonesia. And as a result of these combined initiatives, our unit cash cost declined from $1.90 per pound on a net unit cost basis in the first quarter to $1.47 per pound in the second quarter. This was over 10% better than our April forecast. We're continuing to manage all costs very carefully and expect our net unit cash costs to trend lower in the second half of the year and into 2021, as we increase volumes at a very-low incremental cost. Our current forecast incorporates current market conditions for energy prices, currency rates and other input costs. These input costs have increased somewhat from our April forecast, but this has been offset by improved gold prices. So, we're continuing to expect our net unit cash costs for the year to be roughly $1.53, that's similar to the average cost we estimated of $1.55 in April. And in 2021, the average is expected to decline to below $1.20 per pound. With the rising volumes and declining cash costs, we expect our margins and cash flows expand in the second half of the year. As you look at slide 20, this provides the EBITDA and cash flow sensitivities, and shows the significant cash flow generation that we expect from the business, bringing in the additional volumes into 2021 and 2022 and beyond. As you'll see, if we assume gold prices flat at $1,800 per ounce, and molybdenum flat at $7 per pound, we would generate between $6 billion and $8 billion of annual EBITDA at copper prices ranging between $2.75 per pound and $3.25 per pound. Operating cash flows which are reflected at the bottom of the chart would range between $4 billion and $5 billion at these price levels. This provides significant amount of cash flow to fund our capital expenditures and provides excess cash flows for further balance sheet improvement and returns to shareholders. We're all very-focused on this. We're very close to getting there, as you'll see from the results we expect in the fourth quarter of this year. And much of the capital that was required to generate this result has already been spent to achieve this. And we\u2019ll continue to maintain our focus on delivering these results. On slide 21, we present the capital spending plans. We continue to manage the capital plans in line with the revised estimates we laid out in April. As a reminder, we reduced our 2020 capital spending by about $800 million. And we're tracking very well against those plans. The bulk of the $2 billion capital budget for 2020 is related to the Grasberg underground development, which will pay back quickly as we reach capacity rates. As Richard indicated, the spending for Lone Star in 2020 is largely behind us and we'll begin to generate cash flow from that operation. We have adjusted slightly to 2021 capital budget down from $2.3 billion to $2.2 billion that was originally estimated at the beginning of the year to total $2.4 billion. And we're presenting our 2022 estimates. And as you'll see the spending at Grasberg will begin to decline and decline after 2022 as well. We're going to continue to manage our capital spending levels very carefully. We remain very-disciplined in carrying out our revised operating plans. Turning to our financial and liquidity position. You'll see we had strong liquidity at the end of June, totaling $5 billion and our financial position is strong. We've taken steps to protect the balance sheet and liquidity and we undertook a series of capital markets transactions over the last 12 months to extend out our debt maturity profile and provide flexibility. We also worked with our banks and achieved amendment of our credit facility during the second quarter, which provides substantial flexibility and gives us access to the liquidity under the bank credit facility. We show our net debt at the end of June of $8.4 billion, that's a debt of just under $10 billion net of our cash position of $1.5 billion. And that equates to about 2.5 times the estimated 2020 EBITDA. Notably, that relates if you look at 2021 EBITDA, the leverage is 1.4 times. If we were to apply the 2021 projected excess cash flow to net debt reduction, we\u2019d have $5.3 billion of net-debt at the end of 2021 or less than one time the 2021 EBITDA. Our uses of excess cash will be considered by the Board. There's a strong commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet to drive shareholder returns over the long-term, and our Board will consider financial policy as we go forward. But, we show at the bottom of the chart, the average duration of our debt, which is currently just under 11 years. And as you can see, we've built significant flexibility with the maturity schedule that is very attractive profile over the next few years. Regarding financial policy, as we've covered throughout this call, we remain focused on safeguarding our people and our business, and maintain strong liquidity and balance sheet strength as we manage through uncertainty during the pandemic. As previously reported, our Board has indicated it does not expect to declare dividends in 2020, but this will be evaluated on a regular basis. And as we successfully execute these plans in 2021, we expect to be in a much stronger position with increased cash flows, enhanced flexibility to consider shareholder returns. So that's just a summary of our quarter and outlook. And now, operator, we\u2019d like to take questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Our first question will come from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. David Gagliano : You\u2019ve covered a lot of it in the prepared remarks. But, I did just want to try and talk a little bit more on the capital return policy. Obviously, strong free cash flow generation expected over the next six quarters, net debt metrics flow one times. Is there a target of average, leverage metrics over the cycle? And from a timing perspective, when should investors start thinking about getting some of that cash back? Richard Adkerson : So, Dave, we've always approached those questions not from the standpoint of developing any particular financial metrics, but assessing commodity markets cash flows and where we stand. We will want to reduce our debt from the current levels. We were doing that -- on a track to do that before COVID. And so, as these cash flows recover, and Kathleen talks about capital spending going down, we will have much higher volumes and the prospects for higher copper prices will have opportunities in the relative near-term, beginning in 2020, by the end of 2021, to achieve that goal of reducing debt going forward. Now, I want to compliment Kathleen and her team for the actions they have been taken over the past 10 months or so. We've had three bond offerings now that have been very successful at rates that are really attractive considering the fact that we are just beyond being an investment grade, still we expect someday to get back to the investment grade. But, now, we spread out our maturities. We work with flexibility of the bank group, so we can achieve all that. So, I can't give you anything other than, if this world unfolds like we hope it will and expect it to the very near-future, we're going to be able to return paying dividends, and looking at the possibility of buying stock back, depending on how the equity market reacts to our improved situation. I quite frankly expect the equity market to react positively in a significant way. David Gagliano : Okay. Thanks for that. And somewhat related on the Indonesian smelter, first of all, I'm assuming that the cash flow numbers that are -- those projected net debt numbers are not included anything for the smelter and the CapEx for smelters... Kathleen Quirk : That's right. David Gagliano : Okay. And then, in the press release\u2026 Richard Adkerson : But, let me just say, I know you understand this, Dave, because you followed us so closely over the years. But, to be clear to everyone else, the smelter, if we go forward with the current plan, and as I said, that's under discussion, will be financed by PT-FI where we have a 49% equity interest. But, because of our shareholders agreement with the government of Indonesia and the state-owned company, MIND ID, we consolidate. So, we have a 49% interest. We finance by that entity. But, it will show up as consolidated debt because we consolidate PT-FI, which is really good for the way we present our financial statements. David Gagliano : Okay. That's helpful. Then just really quickly, the related question there on the Indonesian smelter. The press release talks about other alternatives in terms of deferring schedule for the projects as well as other alternatives. Can you touch a little bit more on what those other alternatives might be? Richard Adkerson : One of the positive things about this is these considerations within Indonesian government are being led by the Minister and the Ministry of State Owned Enterprises, whereas in the past, we had to deal with that on our own. We have aligned interest with the state owned enterprises. And a number of alternatives are being considered, which would be alternatives to building the smelter is presently contemplating. It's a complicated political situation, it goes without saying. But the economic benefits to the government are really strong if we were to pursue other alternatives that would require significantly less capital from PT-FI. David Gagliano : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks very much. Richard Adkerson : Thanks, Dave. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Carlos De Alba : Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. So, my question is on the ramp-up in -- of Indonesia on the ground operations. I appreciate and congratulations on achieving the targets and being on the right track to deliver results there. I just got a question on slide 25. The open drawbells on a cumulative blasted basis were -- declined a little bit from the last quarter presentation, just a little bit less in 2020, 2021 and 2022 in the DMLZ; and for the GBC, it is lower in 2020 and 2021, slightly higher in 2022. So, I appreciate that these may be too specific of a question. But, given that this is probably the most important aspect of people going forward, I just wanted to get some clarification as to what drove that rise in the forecast? Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. This is Kathleen. There were just minor revisions to the Deep MLZ and GBC drawbells. And you can see at the end of 2021, we had 213 for Deep MLZ and 322, and those have been reduced by 3 each. It\u2019s not been anything significant and just slight timing differences. By the end of 2022 in Deep MLZ we\u2019re just slightly below, but it doesn't change the ore extraction levels and it's pretty much the same plan that we've been on. Carlos De Alba : Understood. Thank you very much and good luck. Richard Adkerson : I'll just say, this is a -- as I mentioned earlier, this is a complicated operation, Mark Johnson is on the call and nobody knows that better than him. So, there are going to be ups and downs and adjustments and so forth. That's part of our everyday life out there. But, of what we set out to do and what we're doing, and we have confidence that over time, we'll do it. But, having said that, there will be things that we'll have to deal with as we have in the past. So, you'll see adjustments like this occur from time to time. Carlos De Alba : All right. Understand, Richard. Thank you very much for the color. Richard Adkerson : Okay. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Alex Hacking : Yes. Good morning. Thanks, Richard and Kathleen. I just wanted to ask around the production guidance. In the last quarter, in the teeth of COVID crisis and copper prices extremely low, you cut your production guidance for this year and in particular next year where you took a couple of hundred million pounds out of South America. Is that something that gets revisited if copper prices are sustained at these levels, or those kind of revised mine plans locked in that? Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Well, they are revised mine plans that we're following. And we are not. We\u2019re tweaking but we're not making any major adjustments to those until we have clarity in this market situation. But as clarity occurs, the plans will be adjusted, the resources are there some of this -- the cut production was a lower margin production. And if prices increase, it becomes a profitable again. So, there will be timing impacts as to how it ramps up and so forth. So, it'll be part of our future. But, as you know all too well, this is not a turn on it, turn off [ph] it thing. You ratchet back. It has impacts. To ramp it back up takes some time. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Chris LaFemina : Hey. Good morning, Richard, Kathleen. Thank you for taking my question. For me, the most impressive data point in this earnings release was the unit cost performance in the Americas, especially on a site production and delivery cost basis where you had very substantial reductions from the first quarter to second quarter. I suppose that's a function of the changes to your operating plans. My question relates to the guidance. So, if you look at the unit cost guidance for 2020, in particular to South America, it implies that site production and delivery costs will rise in the second half of the year. And I'm wondering why that might be. And I suppose, related to that is Cerro Verde production. I think in the last quarter, you had guided to second half 2020 mill rate of 400,000 tons per day. And in the press release today, you -- in the presentation today, you are guiding to 350,000 tons per day. So I'm wondering if there is some kind of cost increase that we should expect for Cerro Verde in the second half a year. I would have thought that with the mill rate going up from the run rate in the second quarter to the second half of the year, unit costs might actually fall further, but it does not appear to be the case. So, just if you can give us some clarity as to what exactly is going on by cost outlook for the second half of the year in South America in particular. Kathleen Quirk : The main change in the second half compared to the second quarter in South America relates to increasing the Cerro Verde mining rate. And during the second quarter, the mining rate was lower than what we expect. In order to get the mil rate up on a sustained basis, we'll have to begin increasing the mining rate. So, that's what that reflects in the second half. But, to your point about the cost reductions, the team has just done incredible work in bringing down costs. I mentioned the use of reduction in contract costs, contract labor costs. We've had some headwinds on some of the currency exchange rates and energy costs from the low levels that we had in the second quarter. Those have reversed a little bit. But, the discipline of driving the cost performance and balancing that with production is something that our team is very focused on. So that's, to the prior question, about increasing copper volumes, we're being very careful to make sure that we have sustainable cost savings and the cost structure before starting to ramp up. But specifically on South America the increase relates to an increase in mining rate at Cerro Verde from the second quarter levels. Chris LaFemina : Okay. Thanks for that. And so, I one other question related\u2026 Richard Adkerson : Yes. Let me come in here because I really appreciate the comments you made about the performance in Americas. And this goes back to the rationale when put we Phelps Dodge and Freeport together. But, the Americas operations are characterized with these very large, lower grade ore deposits, which is kind of the world forward in the copper industry. And Red Conger and Josh Olmsted had such experience with this, but they're doing such a great job and it's the operations in the field, the way they're managing the team, we operate all the mines that we have interest in. So, we're able to achieve synergies across the board. Our global supply chain group has done just a great job in working with our suppliers and coming in with cost. We've had a playbook for this. I mean, we've done this before and we're doing again very effectively. But, these guys really need to be recognized for dealing with this entirely different set of management challenges than you have with this high-grade mine we have in Grasberg. And I want to also recognize Kathleen and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administration Officer for what we've done with G&A. This is really significant. Our Company changed dramatically at the end of 2016 when we exited the oil and gas business, restructured our management team. But, at that year, we really only had $700 million in G&A. Now, our current expectations are that we go down to $355 million. It's been in steps over these years, but that's almost a 50% reduction in G&A over the past now four years. And this has been done as a process. We made some major steps. We had to furlough some people unfortunately. We had a incentivized early retirement, severance plan. We've reduced our head cut off and our centralized groups by something over 30%. But, this is all part of the things that have come out from this COVID initiative and they all have long-lasting benefits. As a company, we\u2019ll never work in the same way that we did before this COVID thing change. There's going to be less office space, less meetings, less travel. We proved to ourselves that we can work effectively. We did not go back to work in Phoenix when the Governor opened the state up. The halls are and offices are empty in our headquarters. And yet, you can see the results from this core about how effectively we can operate in this kind of environment. And we're learning lessons from that that we will carry forward to the way we do business in the future. Chris LaFemina : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jatinder Goel with Exane BNP Paribas. Jatinder Goel : Good morning. Just a quick question, thinking more long term. Richard, you alluded that when market conditions allow, you can look at Lone Star expansion. And you also indicated about 5-million-ton gap emerging in the market by 2030. To me, the real constrains for you appear to be balance sheet and potentially management capacity till Grasberg is delivered. So, from a long-term perspective, you've got three things probably on your plate, Lone Star, El Abra, and Kucing Liar, which you can look after Grasberg is delivered and balance sheet is at a more normal capacity. How quickly you can move to develop either or all of those projects and what could be the order of priority? So, just trying to get some sense on your earliest possible timeline and order of priority. Thank you. Richard Adkerson : The timelines are long. One of the issues that\u2019s so supportive of copper supply is simply how long it takes from identifying a resource to doing the feasibility studies for how it's to be developed? How it\u2019s to permitted in processing and so forth? So, all of these things will take long time -- long term. And that is a key reason of why the outlook for copper as a commodity is so strong. The current projects that are being pursued today are not in aggregate significant to the market but are significant to companies but they're being delayed. So you ask about our situation. The Kucing Liar fits into our long term mine plan for Grasberg and that's something that we're assessing and we'll consider and look at going forward. Lone Star has the opportunity for oxide expansion, which is growing. That could be done with a limited amount of investment in new facilities. But longer term, there's a large sulphide resource, and this will be long term but it is very, very large. And that would require very, very large concentrator expansion. We have great opportunities at El Abra with our partner Codelco in Chile. We have great opportunities in the U.S. at other properties, including Bagdad, Morenci, Sierrita, our properties in New Mexico. And so, all of these things are being studied. We are going to be very-disciplined about it. First steps for cash flow will be using debt, increasing shareholder -- returns to shareholders, and then we will -- we have restrained spending in the project evaluation area, as we have across the board and our country for the current time. As the situation improves, we'll return to investing in the evaluation process. And from that, we'll come to timing schedule that you have. We don't have one right now. But we will keep you informed as this unfolds and we start spending again and getting in the process for evaluation. But, key, positive feature about Freeport is this opportunity to grow our business internally to develop resources which we get no value for currently today in our stock price. If we develop those ourselves, all that value goes to our shareholders as opposed to making an acquisition where substantial value goes to the owners of the asset being acquired. I know that's not a clear answer to your question, but it's a truthful answer to where we are. Jatinder Goel : That's very helpful. Thank you so much for the clarification. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley FBR. Lucas Pipes : Hey. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on another very strong quarter. Richard, in light of current gold prices, I wondered if you have considered changing your float into foremost in copper, second in gold or something along those lines? Richard Adkerson : Lucas, gold, like copper, has its ups and downs and often gold is up when copper is down, copper\u2019s up when gold is down. I remember years ago when gold was really high, I decided to change the name to Freeport Gold and Copper. That was before... Lucas Pipes : And you already touched on my question that is gold equities tend to trade at substantially lower discount rates. And I wondered how you're thinking about that types that changing names or changing slogans. Thank you very much, Richard. Richard Adkerson : Well, we have over the years looked at a number of strategic alternatives involving our gold asset. Back in the days, before Phelps Dodge, Freeport was a company that was two-thirds copper, one-third gold, and we really struggled to attract investors because of the different objectives of gold investors and copper objectives. And really, we found the only way we could track investors was paying extraordinarily high dividends. And for those of -- you are all too young to remember that, but that was where we were. We made the commitment to the copper business. The gold component of Grasberg is as I talked about earlier a key reason of why that asset is so fabulously attracted. And so, we're a price taker with gold. We continually review options about dealing with it. But, today we concluded that its greatest value to us is funding the cost of Grasberg. Just think about this having 1.5 billion pounds of copper was no cost or negative cost. And so, that's the role we see it playing in our Company. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. John Tumazos : Thank you very much. Congratulations on the great production, and thank you for the update on the next smelter. Some of the other companies have cut back on exploration, waste stripping, underground development or maintenance and the struggle to keep up production. Are there any of those functions that have been delayed at some of your sites such that 2022, 2023, 2024 output targets might be a little uphill or tougher to meet? Richard Adkerson : Kathleen, let me start. So, John, that's a great point. And I mean, you could look back in our history and with the -- in 2008, when the price of copper just cratered from $4 a pound at midyear to approaching $2 a pound by midway in the third, fourth quarter, we did have to make some of those changes. I mean, we parked a hundred trucks at Morenci, right Red? It was something on that order, cut production in half. And that resulted in a multiyear ramp up. So breaking our business apart from exploration, we have essentially terminated all greenfield exploration, which is pretty limited for us anyway, considering our brownfield opportunities. We continue to do work at key operations. That's not going to be a constraint for us going forward. Grasberg, we really have looked at cost hard, made some reductions, but done nothing to slow down the ramp-up of our future. So, we did defer a mill improvement, but which could have some impact, but it was only a short term. Now with prices being where they are, that's not going to be an issue. With the Americas, as I said, we've been very -- so, we're doing this in a way that preserves as much as the future as we can. But, as Kathleen illustrated with Cerro Verde, when you cut back the mill and you cut back mine rates, there is a timing issues in getting the mine rates back up to rates that feeds the mill. So, there will be some impact, but we are so mindful of that that I think we've been very effective in minimizing that impact. In any event, we're going to update this every quarter. And so, we give a lot of details. So, you'll be able to see that as we go forward. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. I was just going to say, the mining rate reduction that we took in the U.S. was deliberate in terms of getting the cost structure as low as possible. And so, the metal production rates that we show in our forecast are consistent with the level of mining rates that we are deliberately working towards. It's not like a situation where we have an update at the metal forecast to coincide with the mining rates. So, our mining rate and metal forecasts are aligned. In second quarter, we did have similar mining rates for Cerro Verde because of the pandemic. That was the only one where we mined less and kept the mill as full as possible, and we'll have to ramp up mining in the second half. But, the rest of the mining operations in the U.S. really were cut back deliberately, and we've reflected that in our metal forecast. If we were to ramp back up, which our current plans assume it will start ramping back mining rates in 2022 timeframe, you would start to see metal improve over time. But, we haven't shortcutted anything. And so, all of our mining rates in metal forecasts are in line. John Tumazos : If I could ask one more, and thank you for the two replies. You have the footnote on the Lone Star slide that the potential mineralization is over 50 billion pounds that I guess would be at least 3 billion tons of mineralized material. In your gut, do you think that the Lone Star is more like 3 billion tons or 5 or 10 or even bigger? Richard Adkerson : Hey, Red? Red, you're on the call, right? Red Conger : Yes. John, it\u2019s a huge district. We're very excited about it as we've reported in the past, lots of drilling to be conducted, where I think we're going to find that the full district has mineralization in it, where if you look at the maps, Lone Star is miles away from those progresses where we first started mining. So, lots of drilling yet to do, but the Lone Star deposit is what we know about, it as a mineralized material that you just cited. And we'll continue to drill and explore there and update those as we get more information. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. And I think John, as you know, the oxide project that we're doing plus potential expansion of oxides is really not only economic in terms of the initial investments. But, it exposes the sulfide ores and makes that opportunity -- it's a long-term opportunity, but makes that opportunity more economic as we continue to mine the oxide. So, we're very excited about the district. And it's a long-term play but one that we feel will be a big part of Freeport\u2019s future going forward. John Tumazos : Thank you. Operator : Your next question we'll have on the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Chris Terry : Hi, Richard and Kathleen. I hope you\u2019re both well. Just a quick one for me and that is the 2021-2022 volumes were just down a touch versus the last quarter, just comparing the two presentations. So, I think it's 100 million pounds or so. Is that just a bring forward effect where you've done better in 2020, or is there something else to that? It\u2019s very minor, but sort of check? Kathleen Quirk : Yes No, the main difference was the mining and milling in South America. We have some -- we assumed a lower rate in Cerro Verde. We were previously at 400 sooner than what's in our current plans, and we've made some minor adjustments also to El Abra. So, they were minor revisions but did end up impacting 2021 and 2022.Grasberg is unchanged. Chris Terry : Okay, thanks. Actually, one follow-up just to complete one of the questions from a bit early just on the cost side. I mean you commented on sort of some of the ups and downs. You had the tailwind from, I think, in Indonesia on the currency last quarter and then oil down drastically. And then, there's ups and downs on mining rights. But from a macro sense, just given that we've now seen copper start to rebound, are we entering environment, where you start to get inflation in general on some of the costs for the business as well, just more from the macro variables? Kathleen Quirk : The main thing that we\u2019ve seen really is on the currency rates. We've had the energy prices from our prior forecasts were up about 18%, from April forecasts. But, we've also had -- and some of this has been offset with gold. But, the way that the dollar has raised against some of these currencies has had an impact on our costs in Indonesia with the rupiah rate and to a lesser extent in Chile and Peru. But,, that's really the only thing we have seen is really these macro, currency exchange rates and the energy prices. We haven't seen -- and we continue to work with our suppliers, we haven't seen inflation in other areas. And of course, with the level of employment, et cetera, the labor rate pressure is not what it is sometimes when you see copper prices rallying. So, we're going to continue to focus on driving out as much cost as we can, using this time period to execute the plans, the revised plans and drive costs as low as we can. And in the U.S. and in South America, the costs really have a big impact on value, because the lower the costs, the bigger the resource. And so, we will focus on that as we go through 2020. Chris Terry : Great, thanks. Thanks, Kathleen, and congrats on a great turnaround in the quarter. Richard Adkerson : Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James. Brian MacArthur : Just two quick questions. First of all, I just want to confirm, the forecast through 2022 and all your production, your cash flows, is Chino in there or is it not? Kathleen Quirk : It is not. It's currently remained idled and we're still evaluating next steps with respect to restart. Brian MacArthur : Perfect. Thank you. My second question and I know maybe getting a little ahead of myself here, but obviously you're going to generate an awful lot of cash flow going forward. And as Richard said, you've been working for 15 years to get everything underground, set up the Grasberg, which have a lot of work. And you've sort of had ongoing major project costs of $1 billion a year and you get down to $900 million in 2022. And I understand too in 2022, the ownership changes in a little bit. But what does the ongoing capital look at -- look like sort of post 2022, once we get the GBC developed, everything's up and running, how long can you do it, like just keep generating without major capital go into KL or something? Because I would think post that period, you've had substantial capital to build this thing for 15 years. Some of that on a runway should come off or is that right? Kathleen Quirk : Yes. And we've got -- in terms of our current plans, we project the capital will decline in 2022 from 2021, as we mentioned, but even further beginning in 2023. We're looking at KL and relooking at the project and running scenarios and trade-off analysis to look at the capital involved in developing KL, which involves potentially having some additional processing equipment to handle pyrite ores. We're looking at if there is a higher NPV option that involves lower capital that would mine the areas that are -- that have less pyrite. And so, actually from a value standpoint, it could be something that's more valuable than just full out development of the whole resource. So, we're currently in those -- in progress with those analyses. But, for the foreseeable future, as we get a Grasberg ramped up, the capital will decline. And we don't have -- we don't have a major decision to make. In the next few years, we will want to settle on what the KL plan is, but in terms of capital outlays, we don't have major increases in capital forecast in our plans for Kucing Liar. We want to deliver the Grasberg and Deep MLZ first. Brian MacArthur : It makes great sense, but would capital down like a lot at Grasberg in \u201820 -- like when I say go down a lot, I mean you've been spending about $1 billion in development a year plus sustaining, give or take, will that go down like $200 million or $300 million for a few years, or I guess that\u2019s all dependent on whether... Kathleen Quirk : Aside from KL, you could see CapEx at Grasberg going down to $300 million or $400 million level. And ultimately, we'll have to make decision on what the plan is for KL. But, it'll go down significantly beginning in 2023 and beyond. So, just the cash flow from GBC -- from Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ are going to be massive. And we'll look at reinvesting that into KL over time. Brian MacArthur : Kathleen, you did say to 3 to $400 million, right? Kathleen Quirk : Right. It'll go down to 3 to $400 million, right, from over $1 billion. Brian MacArthur : Yes. Right. Great. Thank you very much. Again, congratulations on the great progress that has been made. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with VRP. Michael Dudas : Thanks Richard and Kathleen. What a difference a quarter makes, huh? Kathleen Quirk : We were just saying the same thing. Michael Dudas : My question is, Richard, do you think how your company and the industry has evolved and managed through COVID in the past four months and what will happen in the future? Do you think that the industry or maybe Freeport particularly and industry in general will be look -- perceived as a better partner from a labor and a government standpoint? So, as we move forward in the next several years of higher prices and development and maybe some issues with regard to royalties and such, do you think that what\u2019s come out that will be helpful to the industry and that could also maybe be helpful on ESG or any type of thing? Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Yes, I do. In fact, early this morning, I added to my notes that I was going to say that I said earlier actually when we're done with COVID, in many respects [Technical Difficulty] closer to communities and governments. [Technical Difficulty] I recall, going into February, going into March, when we started working remotely, Kathleen and I were looking at each other and saying, okay, now what are we going to do? And by April, we had a plan. Well, that's the situation for all these communities and all these governments, and people are still struggling with that. And so, by our being aggressive in investing in healthcare protocols, testing equipment and doing things to help these communities in Indonesia, I mean, we have two PCR labs. Here in the United States, what does it take often, a week to two weeks to get PCR results? Well, we have two PCR labs, one in Lone and one to the Highlands, which we're working with community use, and that's much appreciated. We had to build an oxygen facility in for Arequipa. So by showing that we are competent in managing these, by showing we have sensitivities to workers\u2019 families and the communities by working with governments to do that, we're showing both, competency, sensitivity and the fact that we are committed to being good partners. So, I think all of that's going to be beneficial. We've achieved that in steps. We moved our headquarters to Arizona several years ago. We made a big commitment to show people of Arizona that we could be good partners. And now, we are broadly regarded as being great partners. So, that's an excellent point. And ESG matters are growing in importance and significance to investors. We know that. We believe that's a good trend. And we will measure up well by that, because that's just what our commitment is. Michael Dudas : It\u2019s quite encouraging. Thank you, Richard. Richard Adkerson : So, thank you all for\u2026 Operator : Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to management. Richard Adkerson : Thank you, Gina. Thanks all of you joining us. We appreciate your interest, appreciate the good questions. Of course, it is -- a quarter\u2019s made a heck a difference, but it is so great now to be focused totally on what we are doing operationally with our business. We look forward to reporting continued progress. As always, if any of you have questions or need some more information, contact David Joint, and we\u2019ll be responsive. Good luck to everybody. Take care. This thing is not controlled yet. So, all of you be careful and watch out for your families and friends. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today.

In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, each filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. On the call today is Richard Adkerson; Mark Johnson is also on the call; Josh Olmsted; Mike Kendrick; Steve Higgins; and Rick Coleman. I'll start by briefly summarizing the quarter's financial results and then we'll turn the call over to Richard, who will review the slide materials. And we'll then open up the call for questions. Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $329 million, or $0.22 per share for the third quarter of 2020. After taking into account, debt extinguishment costs associated with our refinancings during the quarter and other non-recurring net charges totaling $101 million, or $0.07 per share, adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $430 million, or $0.29 per share. These special items can be reviewed on Page VII of our press release. Our adjusted earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, totaled $1.4 billion for the third quarter of 2020, and a reconciliation of the EBITDA calculation is available on Page 32 of our slide deck. Our third quarter results benefited from improved pricing for both copper and gold, strong copper and gold sales volumes that were above the prior estimates and solid cost performance. The average realized price during the quarter for copper was $3.01 per pound that was 15% above the year ago average and the third quarter realized gold price of just over $1,900 per ounce was 28% above the year ago quarterly average. We generated strong cash flows in the quarter. Our operating cash flows totaled $1.2 billion and exceeded roughly $400 million of capital expenditures during the quarter. We ended the quarter with $10 billion of total debt and our consolidated cash position grew during the quarter from $1.5 billion at the start of the period to total $2.4 billion at the end of the quarter. I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to our slide materials. Richard Adkerson : Thanks, Kathleen, and good morning everyone. Thank you all for participating in today's call. I hope you and your families and your colleagues are all staying well and safe. This corona virus situation is not ended. We at Freeport are not letting up our guard in any fashion. We remain focused on protecting the health and safety of our people and the communities where we work, and we're all looking forward to a medical solution, which will come in time. In the meantime, though, we are staying diligent with our health protocols and we're also being conservative in the way we continue to run our business. And this has proved, served us well over the last six months. I'm really proud of our Freeport team for the aggressive response we developed as an organization, how we've executed the plans that we announced just six months ago, it seems like a decade ago, but it was at the end of April when we announced plans that was well received by our company and the market to take steps to reduce cost, capital cost, operating cost and G&A cost, suspend some low margin production. And we put those plans in place and we really went after them in an aggressive way and it served us well. Turning \u2013 starting with Slide 3, we present the highlights for the quarter and it's notable just how much cash flow we're generating. We've been talking about this for a long time [indiscernible] finally arrived for Freeport. This is the quarter where all this work that we've been doing for years and years is beginning to show, is beginning to show its presence. This free cash flow generation will actually accelerate as we go forward into the fourth quarter, into 2021. And by the end of 2021, we'll reach really a \u2013 relatively steady state of volumes and that extends for the 20 years beyond than our current contract rights extend to. But as you see clearly our sales volumes, our cost and capital performances were favorable to the estimates we provided to market three months ago. Our Grasberg team achieved its quarterly sales targets and continue to make excellent progress with the ramp up of our large underground mines, the Grasberg Block Cave, and the Deep MLZ mine. In Arizona, we completed The Lone Star project during the quarter. It was completed on time and below budget. In the bottom line, we generated substantial cash flows in the quarter, reduced our net debt in this quarter by $800 million. And this was all achieved operating safely in a challenging environment because of the pandemic. Our team maintained its focus on the health of our workers in our protocols and showed real drive and commitment in executing our plans while managing this health issue. As an organization, we're all stepping up to meet this challenge. We met challenges effectively in the past. Turning to Slide 4, this is LME Week and it's a strange deal and I being in London, last night would have been the night of our Freeport reception such a fun event and it's disappointing not to be there. We distributed a video to people. And if you didn't get it, contact David and we'll get it to you, but just a lot of fun looking at the video and thinking about all the good times I've had in London and looking forward to coming back next year. But you know thinking about LME Week and the times we're facing right now really makes us all very pleased to be a company that's the leading producer of copper and copper is critical to the economy of the world, has been, but even more so as we look to the future. Copper is absolutely essential and strategic to the technologies that the world is moving to transition to global clean energy future. And more and more we're seeing the adoption of policies both in community and governments, but by companies to reduce carbon emissions. This initiative is no longer being debated as to whether it's needed or not, but there is a real commitment now to accelerate. And as a result of the steps that will be required to reduce carbon, the intensity of the use of copper in those application is really significant. Copper utilization in electric vehicles and the generation of renewable power requires four times more copper per unit than traditional internal combustion vehicles require and traditional power generation requires. The coming transition to 5G technology will be positive from copper with required data centers to supporting infrastructure with lots of new copper wiring required to support 5G. These major trends, which are in place and irreversible, will bring significant new sources of demand for copper. And that will supplement the already significant requirements for copper to fund global growth in the developing world. We are committed at Freeport to being a responsible producer of copper, which is a very favorable metal in terms of these positive ESG factors going forward. In addition to Freeport's commitment to the International Council on Mining and Metals, where I just returned as Chairman after serving 10 years ago, during the third quarter, we committed to the Copper Mark, which is a new assurance framework developed by The International Copper Association that's specific to the copper industry that demonstrates responsible production practices and how operations for copper can contribute to the UN sustainable development goals, and we're fully committed to these things. Currently in the market conditions, thinking back to six months ago, none of us would have anticipated that we would be today just six months later after facing the industrial downturn that was accelerating at that time. And all of the uncertainties from a health and economic standpoints to think that here we would be at the end of our third quarter in such a favorable market condition. And this has been led by the really dramatic recovery of the Chinese economy and demand that's generated for copper. Economic conditions in other parts of the world continue to face uncertainties. And we are certainly sensitive to those uncertainties. And as I said, we're not letting our guard down. But we're encouraged by these demand trends in China. And then we look at global stimulus measures and decarbonization initiatives, which are also supportive of copper demand. At a time when supplies of copper remain limited, and this supply effect has been really emphasized by what we'd gone on with the COVID situation. Prices have recovered from the lows earlier this year. You may recall that we were preparing for a scenario of $2 copper and year-to-date we have copper that $3.15 that's pretty remarkable. But the fundamentals of copper market are increasingly attractive. We put together a slide on five to give a historical perspective on these copper markets. And thinking back, they're really strong similarities and parallels to what we've seen earlier. In the early 2000s, when the world was coming out of the global recession, there was policy driven demand particularly in copper combined with limited new supplies, which was a new factor in the market at that time. And that drove a major repricing of copper to kick off the commodity super cycle. Then again in 2009 following the global financial crisis that emerged in 2008, China again led a significant and unexpected recovery in copper prices, which crisis \u2013 when crisis increased over three times from the lows with that 24-month period. In each of these times, FCX share price performed strongly. On the right side of the chart, which shows what's happened since March, copper \u2013 it's notable and this is something that I think is striking and it's different. The copper inventories have declined even with the major downturn in the global economy. You could have ever thought that the U.S. GNP would drop by a third in the second quarter and copper inventories would not have risen. The global pandemic resulted in disruption of supply as well as demand of course. And with low inventories and limited new supply, the market is positioned for additional gains. As we look forward to a medical solution to COVID-19 and for our economies to recover with major copper intensive infrastructure spending on the horizon. Again, in the past, when the downturn occurred, inventory spills, the inventories had to be run off. We don't have that this time. We have low inventories. And so with recovery, we were better positioned to see copper perform strongly. Now turning to our company, the challenge for us in 2020, unlike these earlier times, when we faced downturns was a long list, the lower prices driven by COVID-19. We were at a time of trough production at Grasberg. We completed mining the Grasberg open pit at the end of 2019. We couldn't even begin to ramp up in any significant way of the Grasberg Block Cave ore body, which is our largest underground ore body until we were complete mining in the pit. So all of this started and production dropped from the pit, it was at low levels from the underground, and then we get hit with a low copper prices from COVID and operational challenges in the Americas, because of their situation and so that makes what's happened for our company over the last six months, really, really special. Our team in the Americas continues to do great work, executing our plans, and the plans were aggressive and challenging. You can see the results of the execution in our financial results. We made the decision to complete the initial Lone Star development project, which is located right in the heart of our operations in Eastern Arizona. This is a relatively small, but very positive returns initial project. And it opens the opportunity for a very large future significant project. The team at Cerro Verde in Peru has done exceptional work in restoring our large scale operations there. They were really challenged by COVID. Our people at Cerro Verde lived in the town of Arequipa, which was facing a challenging community situation with COVID where they work with the local community and with the government to restore operations. We've done that largely. We've had to keep a sharp focus on cost and capital management. We had one mine, an older mine in New Mexico that we shut down operations because of COVID situation where now taking actions to restart that mine next year at a much reduced rate, a smaller footprint will allow us to achieve cost in capital benefits from as compared with prior operations. On the call today, Josh Olmsted and I want to recognize him and congratulate him on his expanded new role in managing our operations in the Americas. Josh was named Chief Operating Officer for the Americas in August, following Red Conger\u2019s departure. Red was great friend and long time employee who decided to move for family reasons. And we congratulate him and wish him well. Josh was Red\u2019s right hand guy for \u2013 along with the rest of our team for recent years. He's an experienced operator; a really good, strong inspirational leader has been with our company 28 years. He has worked in leadership roles at a number of our operations across our Americas assets. Josh is really highly qualified and well prepared for success in this new role. He's off to a great start. He's been a key driver of our innovation initiatives, which all of our team is committed to and is committed to having a high performance culture. The really good thing is Josh has a terrific team around him. We have really significant technical depth world-class in every respect. And we all look forward to working together with him and his team to accomplish both we have for us opportunities going forward. At Grasberg, our third core annual sale volumes on an annualized basis reached 58% of the targeted annual run rate post ramp up. And I want you to focus on this. We generate all these cash flows by being at less than 60% of our targets of where we're going to, and we're making progress on reaching those targets. For so long, I've been talking at these calls about looking at this ramp up. It's not like starting a new operation with a one point in time startup, but it was a process \u2013 a process of increasing volumes with 58% of the target, and you saw we generated this level of cash flows. So as we increase that ramp up volumes grow, cash flows will grow as well. It wasn't without its challenges this past quarter. We had a COVID related labor disruption that we had to deal with. We were actually shut down for four or five days this week, worked with a group of indigenous workers in our workforce who wanted to be able to return to the Lowlands where many of their families lived. We had restricted travel. We had to negotiate a resolution with that. We also had some maintenance issues with the material handling. So it's notable, and we're going to have situations that are inherent part of mining as we go forward. But here's the quarter where we had to deal with temporary shutdown, some unscheduled maintenance issues. And yet we were able to meet our metals target. By the end of the quarter, the mining rates at the Grasberg Block Cave in the deep MLZ had reached targeted levels. We continue to target metal production that will approach 90% of the ramp up targets by the middle of next year, middle of 2021. Unit cost \u2013 note that the unit cost for Grasberg in the third quarter averaged $0.13 a pound. Grasberg of course has this really significant gold component in its ore which at full production rates makes it the largest gold mine in the world, even though it's a byproduct production, but using current gold prices, I'm looking forward. If prices stay at this level, global revenues will fund all of the costs of operations for Grasberg. And we'll be producing over 1.5 billion pounds of copper a year. With full ramp-up that we'll reach at the end of 2021 at a zero or negative unit cost. In Indonesia, I mentioned that the discussions about the new smelter are ongoing; they're being led by our partner, MIND ID interlude. PT-FI requested a 12-month delay in construction of the smelter that we had committed to because of COVID issues, which affects international contractors and local workers. The government is in the process of assessing alternatives to building a new smelter. No decision has been reached. The discussions are going being led by MIND ID and the Ministry of State Owned Enterprises. The alternatives that are under consideration will be mutually beneficial to the government, first of all, and to PT-FI. We will keep you informed as developments occur going forward. I will note that our partnership that we established with the Government of Indonesia and the structure for governance in operating management that we established in December 2018 is really going well. The partnership is strong and mutually supportive. We and the government through the State Owned Enterprise and the Ministry of State Owned Enterprises, the Ministry of Mines, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, we're all fully aligned now in our objectives of creating value for all stakeholders. We're working together and that's a huge positive development for Freeport and for the asset itself. Slide 7. We're focused on execution, that's what we've been saying for so long. And that's what the results show that we have been successful in doing, but we're focused on executing and continued success will drive strong and improving results. We're now on a path to double EBITDA from 2020 levels as we go forward. Execution of these plans all well underway, biggest risks are behind this. There are always be risk with the biggest risk behind us will allow us to grow our copper volumes by 20% in 2021; gold volumes by 70%, that would result in a reduction in net unit cost by 20% for the company and completely expand \u2013 significantly expand margins and cash flows. You see this in our third quarter results, our financial performance will improve throughout 2021. Our current operating rates as I mentioned earlier extend to 2041 with six fiscal terms. This will allow PT-FI to generate massive future cash flows from this set of remarkable copper and gold resources. Our company is going to stay focused on execution. As we complete this transition at Grasberg, we are deferring any decisions about major investments and as we go forward with the higher cash flows that we generated, we'll be able to reduce our debt and further improve our balance sheet to see what we've done this quarter? I'm confident that in 2021, we'll be in a position to recommend to our Board a resumption of our dividend for the Board to consider. And that as we go forward, we will be able to generate increasing returns to shareholders from higher cash flows. In addition, we'll have opportunities to consider significant growth from large scale low cost \u2013 low risk, high return, disciplined Brownfield investments in our large portfolio of undeveloped reserves and resources. Freeport can maintain its production, grow its production without having success and refilled expiration, which we all do or without having \u2013 without having to do any M&A deals. Slide 8 shows this, we have a long live portfolio of mineral reserves with recoverable reserves extends beyond 30 years with substantial options to expand these reserves in the future considering our large inventory of mineralized material with our resources beyond current proved and probable reserves. For now however, I want to reemphasize again, we're focused on executing our plans efficiently, delivering on our targets, as we go forward we'll be accessing growth options in a measured and disciplined way. I'll close with Slide 9, with what we adopted internally as the Freeport Edge. Our management team has had extensive experience in managing this business responsibility. We've been together a long time now. Leadership teams across the company are seasoned, battle hardened, value oriented. We're all intentionally engaged in it. That's one thing I keep talking about our work during 2020. It has been really intense, but our people are energetic, highly motivated. We have an action oriented management structure. We work together collaboratively. We're experienced decisive, never cut corners on important issues like worker safety, community responsibilities, environmental obligations. We keep a long-term focus on our licensed operators around the world. We work hard to earn this and to keep it. We know, and we've had a long history of operating on the premise that our shareholders cannot succeed, unless all stakeholders in our businesses succeed. Freeport is clearly on a global basis foremost in copper. A portfolio of assets are large high quality when established industry leader, great track record, operate mines, developed mines among the largest in the world. Our assets are long lived durable with embedded options for reserve and resource growth. Strong franchises in the U.S., South America and Indonesia. Industry-leading technical capabilities with a strong track record of project execution around the world that we're many years. We've earned the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, our suppliers to financial markets; most importantly, our workers communities in those countries. Notably our block caving experience is if not the most, one of the most extensive and long stating in the history of the global mining industry. And that's so critically important for success, both in the ramp of at Grasberg and being able to continue to execute our plans over the next 20 years. This is not for the faint of heart. We've been operating block cave mines in Indonesia since the early 1980s, and we have an important molybdenum block caving operation in our Henderson mine in Colorado. This is critically important as we tradition Grasberg from the largest \u2013 from this enormous surface mine that we completed at the end of 2018 to the largest block caving operation in the history of the mining industry. Our team has demonstrated capabilities in good times and bad, and I want to close by thanking our people, recognizing their strength and resilience to your dedication. And now this is performance that's evidence in today's report. I'm personally proud to be part of this team. I look forward to the success we're going to have before us in the future. We're all motivated and committed to persevere and to achieve the success for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. So thank you for that. And now I will return \u2013 I will turn the presentation over to Kathleen to talk about some financial matters. Kathleen Quirk : Okay, great. Thanks, Richard. I'll just make some brief comments on financial matters so we can take your questions. As you'll see in the materials, our guidance is very similar to our prior guidance. We have incorporated the plan restart of Chino that Richard mentioned, and that's reflected in the guidance. But I just really wanted to make three points. The first one is, as Richard has said, we're continuing to focus on execution of his plan, which will generate growing cash flows and margins. Clearly the Grasberg underground ramp-up is making great progress, and we're building that on that momentum each quarter. I wanted to mention the cost benefits that we're seeing and the ongoing capital management programs. We now feel that were successfully implemented the plan that we laid out in April. I think when you look at the cash cost in the quarter of $1.32 per pound, and compare that to where we were in the first quarter of this year, you see a 30% reduction in that unit cash costs; also a 30% reduction in capital spending levels. With the increased volumes that we have coming in 2021 at very low incremental costs, we expect our unit net cash costs will decline below $1.20 per pound next year. So we're remaining focused on sustaining all of these costs and capital management programs. We've also implemented savings in a number of other areas, including in general administrative costs, which as you see in the third quarter were over 30% below the first quarter 2020 levels. The second point is, you know, and Richard made this point as well. So the third quarter really demonstrates the growing cash flow generating capacity of the business. We had $1.4 billion in EBITDA during the quarter, and $1.2 billion in operating cash flow, and our volumes are continuing to grow. We expect to continue building volumes during 2021 and using $3 to $3.50 copper, we would average between $7.4 billion to $9.4 billion per annum in EBITDA for 2021 and 2022. And generate nearly $5 billion to over $6 billion in operating cash flow with $2 billion of capital expenditures; so very focused on free cash flow generation as we look forward. And the third point is that our balance sheet and financial position are very strong. As you'll see in the slide materials, the net data is expected to decline rapidly and consent continued execution and performance will allow our board to consider a resumption of dividends in 2021 and increasing shareholder returns over time. As Richard mentioned, we're also continuing to assess the sequence of our future organic projects. We expect to be in a great position, really to maintain a strong balance sheet, provide returns to shareholders and invest in value enhancing projects that are embedded in our portfolio as market conditions warrant. So that concludes our prepared remarks. And operator, we will not take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question, our first question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead. Alex Hacking : Yes. Good morning, Richard and Kathleen, and thanks for the presentations. I'll ask two questions if it's okay. The first question on the dividend, Richard, you mentioned restarting the dividend next year. Any thoughts on how that would be structured, percentage payout in that debt target something like that? And the second quick one if I may, just the copper grade at Grasberg is very, very strong during the quarter. Should we read anything into this? Are grades coming in ahead of your geological models or this was just some variance that we shouldn't read much into? Thank you. Richard Adkerson : So, you know, on the dividend, it's really going to be something that we haven't teed-up for the board yet. We're really focused on getting through this year and going forward. But we are giving thought to this idea as we make further progress on getting to our targets is to how to establish a policy for the dividend. We won't, as I mentioned, we want to take steps to reduce debt. We're on track to doing that. We will likely take a first step of restoring the dividend, but then we will have the opportunity of doing as you said of establishing a financial policy and looking for further shareholder returns, growing shareholder returns in the future, that could be in the form of dividends and depending on how the equity market reacts, we would have the option of looking at stock buy backs. But at this point we're not \u2013 we have not really engaged with the Board to establish a specific policy. Mark, do you want to comment on the grade situation? Mark Johnson : Sure. Yes. Alex, where we're at right now in the Deep MLZ, we're mining some of the highest grade sections of the [indiscernible] sections of the ore body. Estimation of these very high grade zones is always a challenge for our modelers. The concern is always that we take high grade intercepts and smear them over too broad of an area and caused overestimation. So we've taken a conservative but appropriate modeling approach. So the grades that you've seen are a bit of a positive variance that we've had really for the last six months. We believe our overall global estimate is appropriate. We didn't do anything with our sequencing of the cave. We followed our cave management plan and really the grades just came to us more or less as a bit of a positive surprise. But if you look at the grades individually, Deep MLZ is very high grade, it's close to 1.9% and gold grades are about 1.8%. And what we saw was a bit higher than expected grades in that very high grade portion of the mine. Kathleen Quirk : And one of the things that Mark is doing, and the team out there is doing is really focused on the long-term plan. And so, as Mark said, we're following the sequencing to maximize the long-term values and not try to look for short-term wins and they're really doing a good job of staying disciplined on that program. Alex Hacking : Great. Thank you so much. And I should say congratulations on the very strong cash flow in the quarter. Thanks. Richard Adkerson : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America. Timna Tanners : Yes. Hey, good morning everyone. And thanks for the update. Richard Adkerson : Okay. Hey, Timna. Kathleen Quirk : Good morning. Timna Tanners : I wanted to ask two questions, also I suppose, I'm really curious about the Gresik smelter alternatives and the update there. I know you alluded to some ongoing negotiations. I'm just wondering if you could, if it's more than just a delay, if you could give us any color on what that might look like. And then I'll follow up with the second question. Richard Adkerson : So an alternative would be rather than building a new smelter as to expanding the existing Gresik smelter and adding a precious metals refinery to it. That could not be expanded to a size to take all of our future concentrate production, so there it would have to be an agreement allowing us to export the excess. And we were proposing if that's a allowed, I'm going to say if we as PT-FI and this is being led by the state owned ministries in the internal discussions within the government that would involve paying an export fee on that. The benefits would be, we would avoid having to undertake this major new construction project and the financial benefits are really positive for the government. And so with the government, like all other countries around the world, seeing its financial situation being challenged by COVID this is \u2013 this has some fundamental attractions to the government. As you know, when we reached our agreement in 2018, a feature of that agreement was a commitment by PT-FI to build a new smelter that we had years of discussions about that because it is uneconomic to everyone. But to get the deal accomplished in 2018, we had to commit to do that and that commitment's in place. So it's really in the government's hands about what they decide to do, but this issue of the financial benefits to the government is a significant one. Timna Tanners : Okay. That's super helpful. Thank you. And I don't want to take away from all the Grasberg progress and success, but starting to think actually about the next generation of projects and initiatives for the company. I know you've alluded to other projects. Can you kind of run through with us where you prioritize the different options and alternatives out there? So we can start thinking about what's around the corner? Richard Adkerson : I can point to them. We haven't prioritized them yet. We've done some initial pre-feasibility, feasibility type work. We actually suspended some of that as part of our cost reduction efforts in April. But we have a significant opportunity in Chile with our El Abra project where we're essentially 50/50 partners with CODELCO. It has a significant sulfide deposit. It would be a major development project involving a water desalinization plant, but a project from the order of our Cerro Verde expansion, but it has an attractive ore body to consider. And then in the U.S. we have a series of Brownfield expansions at mines ranging from our Bagdad mine in Northwest Arizona. There's in the future a very large sulfide opportunity at Morenci, this Lone Star property as we've mine the oxide cap, we're exposing what looks to be a very significant sulfide resource, which I believe will be developed. The U.S. opportunities have some economic advantage. We own all of our lands in the U.S. essentially all of our lands and sea; so there's no royalties. The tax situation is very favorable and we have a big NOL carry forward. So when have the ability to develop resources with no taxes, no royalties, that's a big, big fundamental economic advantage. So as we go forward, we'll be doing a trade-off studies and making decisions about where and when to invest, that's in the future. We have a long line of potential partners who are interested in working with us. That'd be something we could consider. But right now, we're going to continue to focus and achieve the kind of success for the next few quarters like you saw in this third quarter. Timna Tanners : Okay. Super. Thanks for all the detail. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, Timna. Richard Adkerson : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Chris Terry : Hi, Richard and Kathleen. A couple of questions from me. First on Grasberg, just on the development rights for the quarter; I think you said you try to be at 90% by the middle of next year. Just wondering if the third quarter exit rate, that was just looking at the chart from last quarter and slide pack, I think that 94,000 tons is back on track. I just wondered if he could give some details, a bit more specifically on during the quarter, some of those hiccups if so, you said COVID 4 to 5 days. Was there anything else in there? And basically what the messages sending, I think is at the end of the quarter you're back onto the chart? The progress chart, that's my first question, I'll start with that. Kathleen Quirk : That's right, Chris. We did have the five day outage for the work stoppage, and then we had some overflow maintenance that was unplanned during the period. And by the end of the quarter we had gotten back to the rates and Mark and his team do an update every quarter and went through the five year forecast. And essentially there was a very little change in our ramp-up. So we're still \u2013 we're still on track with the getting to a 90% of the run rate by mid next year. Richard Adkerson : Okay. I think on every one of these calls, we noted that there will be things we'll have to deal with from time to time just to inherit the nature of mining. And what I say is the fact that we had these and we're still able to have this kind of quarter. So as we go forward and as we open up more access to these ore bodies, that gives us more flexibility. If we do have some issues to deal with offsetting those by adjusting our operations because of this greater access that continues to emerge. Chris Terry : Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Richard. The follow-up question I had is just around the dividend. I know you commented before that it's early days, but just wanted to get an update on the target net debt level. I think you previously talked about 5 billion it's been around that level that you would think about the dividend. Is that still the thinking on 5 billion more correctly is about the level of net debt that you're targeting. So then you can explore other options. You're obviously at 7.6 billion now. So that's still how we should think about the timing of the dividend when you break it up that level? Richard Adkerson : We said that back five years ago, we set a target of reducing what was then $20 billion of debt to five \u2013 by reducing $20 billion by $5 billion to $10 billion. So that's the $5 billion, nothing magic about it. In fact, in those earlier years that I referred to when we started generating so much cash in both of those cases, we totally paid off our debt. We were debt free, 2005 I believe we were debt free in 2010, 2011. That's just because these cash flows when the market is really good, really come at you really strong. And so in both of those cases, we were able to pay big dividends. And so we were certain, we're comfortable with the debt level we have now. Kathleen and her team has done a great job of structuring our maturity schedules. So we got really strong liquidity and certainly $5 billion would be a level of debt that we'd be comfortable living within the long run. So we'll manage our business on the basis of the cash that comes to us in our expectations by cash flows. But I think you could be comfortable in saying that, that $5 billion target is something that would be acceptable to us. Cash may come to us that we've paid down more than that, but as we did that would clearly be returning cash to shareholders and looking at these opportunities for future investments. Chris Terry : Thanks, Richard. Thanks, Kathleen and well-done on a great quarter. Thanks. Richard Adkerson : Thanks, Chris. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. David Gagliano : Great. Thanks for taking my questions, and as always thank you for the detailed update. You covered a lot of the things that I was hoping to ask about already. But, I do have a bit of a follow-up on the capital allocation question. On the Brownfield opportunities, I was wondering if you can just talk about the timing of investing in those opportunities relative to the 2021 dividend recommendations for the Board. Richard Adkerson : Well, and this is a feature of the industry, David. Even with all of these projects and the Brownfield expansions, execution of those will take a long period of time. Even if we were to start today and we're not starting today. So each of these projects that would be significant projects. Now we're going to do things to make incremental improvements through the efficiency programs and so forth and so we have an initiative to actually increase volumes without making a capital investment, and we call it the America's concentrator project. But far a major Brownfield investment project from the time we make the decision to start, and that's not likely to occur until 2022, 2023, you're still looking at six or seven years at a minimum, the execution on it. So with positive cash flows, will those won't stand in the way of really having significant increases in returns to shareholders. Kathleen Quirk : And Dave, we'll have some incremental projects that we can look at that would be quicker than that, but Richard's talking about a major investment, but we'll have some incremental opportunities that we can evaluate as well during that period. David Gagliano : Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Dave, I think the way to think about it is, we have a fully developed set of assets essentially now. And we're in \u2013 we will be, was with kind of positive markets that we have now that we appear to be moving more towards the future. We're really going to be in a harvesting set of years for the near term. And I think that's a great to be a natural resource company and being able to look at the benefit of the decisions you made over many years and see that you made the right ones and you generate cash and return it to shareholders. David Gagliano : Perfect. Thank you. Richard Adkerson : By the way Dave, we thought about you on Monday at lunch. So we miss being in London. David Gagliano : No problem, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Chris LaFemina : Hi, good morning, Richard, Kathleen. Thanks for taking my question. It's really a strategic question about Grasberg. And Richard as something I know you've addressed at times in the past, but obviously the world is changing and things like Grasberg are changing pretty quickly. So the question relates to the potential rationale of selling a portion of the gold production from Grasberg as a gold stream, presumably you would get a premium multiple. The ability to do so, I would think, has increased. Now that Grasberg is ramping up and being de-risked. This would accelerate your ability to return capital potentially even via buyback, which would be pretty compelling. I think, right now, probably be very significant and positive for your shares would really \u2013 would not really reduce the competitors in the mine and would probably reduce the perceived risk around Freeport as it would reduce your exposure to Indonesia a little bit in the market. So obviously in the past, Grasberg was such a critically important asset to Freeport. You obviously owned more than 90% of the mine for a long time, but now that you've done this transition, ownership is transitioning as well, but the operational transition to the underground. And again the fact that arguably the value of the gold from the asset has been not reflected in your shares. What is your argument to not sell a portion of that gold as a stream? Thank you. Richard Adkerson : All right, well, Chris, one bit of correction there about the ownership. Since the mid 1990s, Rio Tinto had a joint venture ownership in this interest. And so, while the government's interest was roughly 10%, FCX's interest was net of the Rio Tinto joint venture interest. So what we own in Grasberg today is essentially the same that we've owned since the mid 1990s. It's just that the Rio Tinto interest was transferred from a joint venture interest of Rio Tinto to shares owned by the government. So our fundamental interest has not changed. Did you follow that, Chris? Chris LaFemina : Yes, that's right. So, basically, my point is that Indonesia will be the majority owner of the mine, whereas historically they own less than 10%. So the\u2026 Richard Adkerson : They own 51% of the shares. And in the past that ownership interest there 10%. They acquired about five from us, but they acquired the Rio Tinto interest. But when you look at FCX's ownership interest, it really hasn't changed from what we've had for over the years. And that was one of the really good things about the deal that we got in 2018 is we were able to hold on to the interest that we had, even though the government had these ownership objectives, which they reached by acquiring the Rio Tinto interest. So that's just\u2026 Kathleen Quirk : The cost will change but our economic interest did not. Richard Adkerson : That's right. Our economic interest has not changed. That's just a clarification. But, yes, we're fully aware of the opportunity that we have to look at a gold streaming opportunity. As you know, we've assessed those over the years in various forms. And with the spike in gold prices currently, it makes that a new opportunity for us. We need to get ramped up. You don't want to sell a stream before you have the stream in place, but we're studying various alternatives for doing that. And we recognized the opportunity to generate cash and restructure our balance sheet and our ability to deal with returns to shareholders and so forth. So that's on our plate. You can rest assure that bankers are visiting us regularly and talking about that opportunity and it's something we'll be considering. Our first order of business though is to get it ramped up. Chris LaFemina : And sorry. Second question along those lines, in terms of the operational performance at Grasberg, can you just give us an update and I'm sorry if you mentioned this earlier, I might have missed it on the call before, but can you give us an update in terms of number of COVID cases at Grasberg between your employees and between contractors, if things are getting better or worse, we'd run in COVID at the mine, just an update there. Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Yes. I mean, I'm just \u2013 when COVID broke out, Grasberg was the huge concern. I think most of you know, we have an enormous workforce there. It was on the order of approaching 30,000 people, roughly 20,000 at any point in time were living in close proximity to each other in the highlands area of New Guinea where it's damp and cool and people live and work together. So we really recognize that as a problem and made major investments in medical facilities, in protocols for managing it, testing equipment, PCR labs both in the highlands and the lowlands. We did all the things at the health standards say that you should do in terms of finding infected people, tracing, isolating and treating. And so, over time, we've had \u2013 and Indonesia as a country is \u2013 is a country that's challenged with COVID. So we've had a number of cases, fortunately the huge majority of those who have recovered or non-symptomatic, our process of isolation and restricting travel and testing has worked. The serious cases we have had have been few, and the most serious ones were ones where people had previous health conditions. So it's consistent with what people are faced with around the world. We've really done well in the highlands. We had an outbreak of cases in the lowlands where our ship terminal is and where people there have more of an interaction with the community to make a \u2013 which is less of a control situation. But we've instituted new protocols there and it made a great progress. So we've had to deal with it. We've had a number of cases, almost all have now recovered. And we continue to have very strict protocols on travel interactions and people there. So the government, and in large part, the local community support us. We're supporting local community with helping them health issues and testing procedures. So it's been an issue, but has been managed. Chris LaFemina : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Orest Wowkodaw : Hi, good morning. Richard Adkerson : Good morning. Orest Wowkodaw : Just turning our \u2013 good morning, turning our attention back to Grasberg. Obviously, there was, I guess, a bit of a setback there in the third quarter, but you recovered really well with that exit rate of 90,000 tons a day. Can you give us a sense of how that's continued through October? And if I'm not mistaken looking at your slides, it wasn't your planned exit rate for the year at 95,000? So, I mean, doesn't that mean you're essentially already there at the end of September? Richard Adkerson : Yes, you're right. I mean, it's going well and I would not \u2013 you got to look at where I am. I'm really sensitive. I wouldn't call them what we face was a setback. It was just a situation we had to face and we managed it. I mean, man, you look back over the years, that's always the case. It's always the case with complicated mines. So it certainly wouldn't be \u2013 I wouldn't characterize it as setback, but yes we're on track. We're on track in October. If we have had any significant issues to report today, we would have reported them. So, we just feel great about what's going on. This was a critically important time for us at Grasberg in 2020 completing mining the pit and really taking the ramp up over the hump to the point where it was ramping up in generating cash flows. This was a quarter that we always knew was going to be the quarter where cash flows were going to start coming in. They did. We had to do that in managing the COVID situation and we just talked about. So it's a remarkable accomplishment that we've been able to do that and we feel very good. We feel like we've avoided the major risk of COVID. We've now avoided the major risk of the ramp up. Mark and his team will face issues every day. We're communicating about how things are going with the various aspects of our operations, how we're doing with our maintenance programs, how we're doing in. We've had a lots of excess capacity in the mill, but that's we're going to start filling the mill up. So, we've got to be prepared for that, but we're on track to 200,000 tons a day plus of ore from these underground ore bodies to the mill and everything is on track and it's really gratifying to see. Kathleen Quirk : And we haven't had geologic or geotechnical type things, the kind of things that we're aiming to in the third quarter other than the labor issue was just more mechanical type things, maintenance type items and ore getting hung up in passes and that sort of thing. And that's going to happen from time to time, but those things are more easily dealt within geologic or geotechnical issues and we're pleased to report we just feel it's been going very well on the geologic and geotechnical front. Richard Adkerson : Yes. This fracking approach then Mark and his team came up with, the Deep MLZ mine was delayed on the order of two years as we dealt with the seismicity issues, but \u2013 which is not a factor in the Grasberg Block Cave because of the geological setting that it's in, physical setting, I should stay, but that was an issue in the Deep MLZ, they came up with the solution and it's working. We still have seismic events from time to time, but the fracking is helping us to manage those. And we're being able to achieve the results that you see. And it's straightforward fracking. It's not as complicated as what's going on in the oil and gas industry in the Permian basin. This is a really straightforward type of operation. Orest Wowkodaw : Is it possible that you may actually exit this year ahead of plan, I think you've been \u2013you're already at 94,000 tons a day? Richard Adkerson : Certainly possible, and our guys are going to do the best they can do. We set our plans as being aspirational plans, but achievable. And the guys work every day to try to do better than planned. And they take \u2013 it's a great \u2013 I mean the smiles on our faces when we have these days, when we go over plans, its felt all the way from [indiscernible] where we are here in the United States. So everybody is oriented to try to beat the plans. And in the Americas too, I mean, Josh \u2013 Josh's guys have done a great job. Our safety statistics are great. We did have an unfortunate \u2013 fortunate fatality at Grasberg, where a worker took a really unfashionable action, but we work hard, but our safety statistics are good. Our people are focused. I think one thing about \u2013 one thing I think of this COVID thing has done for all of us is really made us focus on our work even more intently than we ever had. And I keep talking about work is intense. And so now with having restricted travel, making sacrifices in your personal life, everybody is really focused on work, and we can see the results of that globally. Orest Wowkodaw : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Carlos De Alba : Yes, good morning everyone. Thank you for taking the question. So, first, just maybe Richard if you could elaborate and you maybe early on to provide this number, but what sort of estimate CapEx do you \u2013 would you envision for the alternative to and brand new copper semester in Indonesia? Expanding of the current \u2013 expansion of the current semester and adding the precious metal refinery how much would that cause relative to the $3 billion, I think that Kathleen had mentioned for potentially CapEx of a new semester? Richard Adkerson : Rick Coleman is on the line, and he manages our capital projects globally and he's involved in the smelter rig hit. Is there any way we can give an order of magnitude number on the aggressive smelter. Kathleen Quirk : Yes, and I'll jump in here, Richard. The prior estimate for the new Greenfield smelter was $3 billion. And the estimate for the expansion of Gresik for 30% expansions is roughly $250 million and similar amount for the PMR; still we're going to do a PMR anyway in the original configuration. Richard Adkerson : Yes. Carlos De Alba : All right, thanks guys\u2026 Richard Adkerson : And it's an economic project that current PCRC raise, which the new smelter would not be\u2026 Carlos De Alba : Perfect. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Good luck. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley. Please go ahead. Richard Adkerson : Hi, Lucas. Hang on just one second. I just want to say, just to emphasize, we've got financing available to us, ready to go if we do have to build a new smelter, it would be debt financed, no capital required by shareholders and PT-FI FCX, would not have to put capital into this. It would be the losses that the smelter generate would be tax deductible. And when you look at the current situation out there with the government owning 50% of the equity with having taxes and royalties, the government's share of the economics of the project, including the smelter, is in excess of 70%. So, we do consolidate this and I'm glad we do, even though we own 49%, we at FCX control operations of PT-FI. So it would be consolidate debt, but it would not require a capital to be put into PT-FI for the smelter from FCX. Lucas Pipes : Good morning Richard and team. This is Lucas. Richard Adkerson : Sure. Lucas Pipes : Great job on the quarter. And my first question \u2013 on my first question I just wanted to explore another angle of this, what's next theme that's been a part of this call here? And would there be any interest to supplement your development pipeline with an acquisition of pre-production copper gold projects? There would a couple of candidates in North America. I am curious how you think about that opportunity set. Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Yes, we look at all of those. We're approached with opportunities and we have our \u2013 we have a long-term history in the marketplace, so we are as a company familiar with all of these projects and mineral opportunities in North America and so forth. The challenge that we have found today \u2013 and we'll continue to do that, but the challenge we found today is we have these internal resources that have currently no value in our share price. And if we're successful in creating value, 100% of that value comes to our shareholders. But if we were to acquire properties from someone else, we'd have to pay to their shareholders, the current value of that. So it's hard to make the numbers work quite frankly. Lucas Pipes : Very helpful. I appreciate that. And then as a follow-up question, I wanted to follow up on your CapEx guidance. You maintained prior guidance. And any risk to that number? Any sort of CapEx risk that we should be thinking about given the plans you put in place earlier this year, and obviously that's been very successful, but I would appreciate your thoughts on that and how you think about CapEx and long-term CapEx over the coming years? Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Lucas, we're in a \u2013 next couple of years really we had the peak in 2021 at Grasberg and it will be declining after that. So as we look out absent other projects, our capital expenditures will decline significantly from the 2022 levels. So, we're talking about something on the order of $1 billion to $1.2 billion in sustaining capital. And we've got some ongoing development at Grasberg, but it won't be anything like what we've got in these next few years. So we do have rising cash flows, declining CapEx and we'll be evaluating there are opportunities to have some incremental expansions, but as Richard said, we're really looking forward to harvesting cash flows for a period of time. Lucas Pipes : Very helpful. I appreciate that and continue. Best of luck. Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Thank you very much. Just a quick production question from your two part one. Can you just give us a quick update in terms of what the current situation especially in South America where you operate? Are you able to fully return to kind of pre-COVID levels kind of production wise at this point in time? Or you still see any kind of lingering pressure from local communities, local governance in terms of workers returning to the site, this sort of thing. And I'm not just telling them how to do online, told them about what you're kind of hearing and seeing in the industry. And then related to that question, when we kind of think about 2021, presumably I think that a lot of the growth that you're going to see in copper production sales of 2021, some of that would kind of weighted onto the back half the year. Is that a fair way to look at it like back half \u2013 is a little bit stronger than the first half of the year production wise? Those are my two questions. Thank you much. Kathleen Quirk : At Cerro Verde, in Peru where we've done really well, Richard said, the team has done really great job. Getting back to we're roughly 350,000 tons a day. Prior to the COVID, we were close to 400 and looking to grow. We still think that we can do that over time, but for the foreseeable future until there's a complete return to normal in terms of people going back and forth to work and it's normal, we're going to operate at this lower rate. So we've \u2013 that's all reflected in our plans, but we do expect Cerro Verde at some point next year and into 2021 to begin wrapping up again. I think the situation in Peru is and then Josh Olmsted is here can comment, but this \u2013 we're continuing to be very vigilant with our protocols have been effective. Same in Chile, Chile did have some escalating cases earlier, but that seems to have abated some with the actions that the industry has taken, but still very much like it is around the world, no one has really let up their guard and we're continuing to be very careful about how we're operating in the COVID environment. Josh Olmsted : Yes. And one thing I would say, and this is true for us in managing the COVID situation, and it would apply to different operations, site specific challenges. So you can't really generalize about what happens with us versus what would happen with other companies. We have had a totally different situation in Cerro Verde than in Morenci and Grasberg. And so I just caution you about trying to generalize when you hear something about one company situation, applying it to other sites of other companies. Richard Adkerson : Yes, I wouldn't do that. I mean, I think there was a couple of Bloomberg headlines out suggesting that Peruvian mine workers were a little bit still returning to the mine site. So I kind of figured that that was industry-wide just Peru alone, it wasn't something we\u2019re trying to extrapolate Grasberg or Morenci for that matter. But right, even within Peru, I mean in the second quarter, the government in Peru on a very sudden basis shut down mine. And we had a different situation because most of our workers lived in Arequipa. And so we had to then go to work with the local community and government. And we had to construct some temporary living facilities on-site for people to live and demonstrate to people that we could manage the house situation. And that would be a different situation than other operations, where they have their workforce living \u2013 already living on their site. So anyway, we've had to manage it and our guys down there just done a tremendous job, we're not in full production, but we're originally 90 day production and we're making a lot of money out of Cerro Verde now, and we have the opportunity to increase it. Kathleen Quirk : And to your second question, the volumes we expect will increase quarter-by-quarter through 2021. And that's mainly because of the Grasberg ramp up. And as we said, we expect to get to about 90% of the run rate by middle of next year. So but the back half will be bigger than the front half, but the front half will still be significant and growing from where we were in the third quarter. Andreas Bokkenheuser : That's very clear. Thank you very much for answering my questions. Richard Adkerson : Thank you for your question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. John Tumazos : Thank you very much and congratulations on so much progress. Richard Adkerson : Thanks, John. John Tumazos : Just sulfides concentrators that you've talked about for a couple years. Are any of them even 10% engineered and what's the six to seven year time horizon you're talking about. You're saying that none of them would arrive earlier than 2027. Richard Adkerson : Rick, I think that's a fair statement, right? Rick Coleman : Yes, that's right, Richard. With permitting and \u2013 with downstream engineering is definitely not more than 10% on the larger concentrator designs. John Tumazos : Okay. Kathleen Quirk : And again, John, that's where he's referring to is major new projects like, there are a lot of project would be like another Cerro Verde. As we said, we also have incremental type expansions within the portfolio that don't require permitting or don't require major multi-year planning. So we've got a combination of both, but the major projects, like the one that operates is multi years because of the permitting that has to be done and all the infrastructure. But we do have other options within the portfolio that wouldn't be as lonely. John Tumazos : Lone Star or the oxide is so vast that the sulfides wouldn't be exposed or you wouldn't need the sulfides until 2027? Richard Adkerson : Right. And so Lone Star, which made it so attractive initially, is it dovetails in with the depletion of the Safford reserves, which was part of the mine plan there. So we had existing processing facilities and Lone Star is so close to Safford that we're able to truck the ore to Safford facilities and also build new facilities, the oxide resource is growing. And we may have an opportunity to invest in incremental processing facilities, take advantage of that. So but this Lone Star sulfide is longer term, even then the opportunities that we have at the other projects, because we can make so much money off of oxides before we develop it. Kathleen Quirk : And we've done a lot of work on drilling over the past several years on Lone Star. And we'll be incorporating that drilling. This joint was also into our longer range plans. And a lot of our exploration budget over the last few years has been on Lone Star. So we were really prioritizing that opportunity. John Tumazos : If I could ask one more, if we just take, for example, an El Abra sulfide now, if you're largely copying the 240,000 metric ton a day, most recent module at Cerro Verde and the diesel plant pumping pipeline is sort of an off-the-shelf, third-party design. Why would the \u2013 pits pre-stripped, why would the engineering and planning take a long time in El Abra? Kathleen Quirk : It's not just the engineering and planning. It's the permitting, as Rick was saying, we've got to, we'd have to do an EIS, and you've got a baseline that you have to provide in terms of data going back on it. And so it's a new mill, new diesel, we don't have a mill there now. But it's an attractive project, it's a very attractive project, but we may have more attracted projects that are less capital intensive. John Tumazos : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dudas with Vertical Research Partners. Mike Dudas : Hi, good morning, everybody. Richard, I'm not going to ask you what you think is going to happen in the U.S. elections next month. So that's okay. But I want to \u2013 wait if you want to opine go right ahead, but I want to see what your thoughts are on say this month in Chile with the constitutional vote and looking into next year, presidential elections in Peru and Chile. Any sense of how that could impact possibly negatively tenor or support for mining and overall, maybe some of the labor situations that could pop up? Richard Adkerson : Well, thanks we're not putting me so much on the spot. It's not just next month, it's almost next week now that we got the election here in the U.S. and this goes beyond the presidential election. We've got complicated political situations everywhere. And Latin America is always a complicated area. The thing though that underlies this is that with the COVID challenges that the economies around the world are facing, but particularly in Chile and Peru, I think, that, however, the political situation unravels, there's going to be a need for those countries and objective of those countries is provide a favorable environment for mining investments. In Chile, which has had such long-term success from that there's a growing recognition of the need for Chile to not lose its competitive edge that it's had. And some of that's been eroded with some recent legislative regulatory actions. So I'm confident that those countries will see the benefits of mining investment. In Peru the bigger challenges which we fortunately found a way to manage effectively is how do mining investments interact with local communities because that's what's really been the barrier there as opposed to central government barriers. Mike Dudas : I appreciate that. Thanks for Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jatinder Goel with Exane BNP Paribas. Jatinder Goel : Hi, good morning. Just a quick one on your 2021 unit cost guidance. You've left it unchanged below $1.20 there can be lot of vacant room based on the prices. Are you able to indicate decision to spot gold/molly and currencies with their production outlook what would net unit cost look like for next year? Kathleen Quirk : We will update our guidance for 2021 next quarter. Our plan right now is below a $1.20 and we haven't gotten more specific than that. But we'll certainly update that when we come out with our updated guidance. But we're trending well below $1.20 at this point on our current plan at $1,900 gold and $8 molybdenum. Jatinder Goel : And just to confirm, you are using $1,800 in that $1.20, or is it lower than that? Kathleen Quirk : Our current plans that we're using and we just \u2013 we run scenarios, but our current plan with the guidance in the deck is $3 copper, $1,900 gold and $8 molybdenum. Jatinder Goel : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Mancini with Gabelli Funds. Chris Mancini : Hi everybody. Thanks a lot. And congratulations on Grasberg, it really is, as you've been saying Richard, all along, having followed the company for a long time just the amount of tons that you're moving there every day, along with building the mine, along with dealing with COVID and everything, it's really fantastic. What you've done there you have ways to go, but congratulations. It really is a great job. Richard Adkerson : Yes, Chris we've been talking about it for a long, long time haven\u2019t we? Chris Mancini : Yes, you have. And like you say, you are starting to inflect here and it's impressive what you've been able to do. So I just wanted to say that quickly. And just another quick question, don't want to put you too much on the spot, but relative to Lucas's question about acquisitions, and you're saying that you not really getting, seeing a lot of value in potentially buying something how would you feel about conceptually a merger of equals with another mining company? And just given what we've seen in this space about like you say, kind of value destruction in the natural resources space, in terms of deals that have been done at premiums, what do you think conceptually about merger of equal \u2013 potential merger equals, or just conceptually in the space or\u2026 Richard Adkerson : Conceptually you can identify circumstances where mergers of equals make sense, because of the ability to reduce cost and operate more efficiently through asset management, and so forth. But in our case where we're on the verge of this \u2013 when we made great progress, now we're less than 60% there in terms of the volumes that we will achieve at Grasberg. I also believe we have the potential, even though copper markets are strong now, one of the reasons we showed that chart with the earlier years is I believe there are factors working today that could well make copper much more valuable as we go forward. They are having all these polls in connection with the virtual meetings with LME Week going on. And when you look at all the polls that people are taking copper is far outstripping other metals. So I just don't believe, and I'm a shareholder, as you know, I don't believe as a shareholder, that there is any way that we would want to consider a merger of equals right now, where we would dilute the opportunity that we have as a standalone company that\u2019s so attractive. We worked for it for a long time. And I think \u2013 I wouldn't want \u2013 and the reason I'm working in everything else is I believe we're on the verge of really good things happening at Freeport. I just made a brief reference to what happened to us in earlier years. We've had ups and downs with the company for various reasons since then, but this time we're committed to sticking to our guns. Our board has made a firm commitment five years ago to focus on what the real value opportunity to Freeport is. And that's in the copper business with this set of assets. We've shown in the past, what we could do with essentially this set of assets and how we could build real value. I\u2019m getting to the age of where I tell too many war stories, according to some of my friends, including our CFO, but there was \u2013 2011, we had a company with a $60 billion market cap and no debt. And I think we're on the verge of rebuilding that we've taken the steps. But this is not what this company can be and what we're on the track today. And I firmly believe, and as I talked to our shareholders, nothing [indiscernible] about it that the best opportunity for our shareholders with this set of assets is to stick with a strategy that we're on right now. And it's not a short term strategy, as we've talked about, we got short term positives going for us, but there's a longer term set of opportunities that's really attractive. Chris Mancini : Right, okay. Yes, that makes sense. I mean, given where you are now and I mean, so do you think that once Grasberg is fully ramped, you would have a different view potentially? Richard Adkerson : We'll always view the opportunities as they come about. Chris raised earlier the opportunity if this goes streaming deal, and that's certainly something we'll consider. But yes, we'll \u2013 opportunities emerge on an opportunistic basis, that's using the same word twice, but you know helps that emerge for us without having a long-term strategy of doing it. But it was an opportunity that came up because of circumstances. And we took advantage of it. If opportunities come to us in the future, that makes sense for our shareholders and we will act on it. But for right now, it's not the time to do that. Chris Mancini : Okay. Well, great thanks a lot. And again, congrats to the team for doing a great job at Grasberg so far and the rest of the operations. Thanks. And congrats to you Richard. Thanks. Richard Adkerson : We appreciate your comments and your support for all these years. Operator : Now, we'll turn the call over to management for any closing remarks. Richard Adkerson : Well, thanks everyone. Appreciate your interest. Obviously a great quarter for us, and we look forward to reporting continued progress. So it's been a tough world. We live in lots and lots of personal sacrifices. It's gratifying though to see within our company to see the success that we're all sharing together. And I think we've made clear today, our commitment to continue to move forward with progress and success in the future. But thanks for being on our call today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan fourth quarter conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 operating and financial results, and a copy of today's press release and our slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website Homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call will include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described on our SEC filings. On the call today are, Richard Adkerson. We also have a number of our senior team with us today. Mark Johnson is here, Josh Olmsted, Mike Kendrick, Rick Coleman, and Steve Higgins. I'll start by briefly summarizing the results for the quarter, and then, we'll turn the call over to Richard, who will be reviewing our outlook. After our prepared remarks, we'll be taking questions. Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $708 million, or $0.48 per share in the fourth quarter and $599 million, or $0.41 per share for the year ended 2020. We had a number of special items in the fourth quarter, which are detailed on Roman numeral VII of our press release, those totaled net credits $142 million, or $0.10 a share, mainly associated with the gain on the sale of assets and partly offset by charges for litigation settlement and international tax matters. Our adjusted net income attributable to common stock after these items totaled $566 million, or $0.39 per share for the fourth quarter of 2020. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA, for the fourth quarter approximated $1.9 billion and we generated $4.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the year 2020. A reconciliation of our EBITDA is available on Page 38 of the slide materials. We had a very strong fourth quarter. Our sales volumes of copper of 866 million pounds were 3% above our October 2020 estimate, and our gold sales of 293,000 ounces were 9% higher than our October 2020 guidance. These primarily reflected higher copper sales from Cerro Verde and in Indonesia and higher gold ore grades in Indonesia. We benefited during the quarter from improved pricing for both copper and gold. The realized price of copper was $3.40 per pound in the fourth quarter, and that was 24% above the year-ago quarterly average. Fourth quarter gold realized price was $1,870 per ounce, and that was about 25% above the year-ago average. Our unit net cash cost came in at an average of $1.28 per pound of copper and that was lower than what we had guided to in October. Notably, in the fourth quarter, we generated very strong cash flows, which totaled $1.3 billion in the quarter and that exceeded our capital spending of just under $400 million during the period. We were - together with our asset sale proceeds in the fourth quarter, we were successful in reducing our net debt by about $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter alone. And we ended the year with net debt approximating $6.1 billion. We had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility, consolidated cash of $3.7 billion and we are in a strong position as we look forward to generating increasing cash flows as we go forward. I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to our slide materials that you can reference on our website. Richard Adkerson : Good morning, and thank you all for participating in today's call. It's great to be able to talk to you today about our performance in 2020 and our positive outlook. It's been a head-spinning year when we think back to March and April, and all of the challenges we were facing at that point and the world was facing to have - be at this point is really head-spinning in many ways and remarkable, but it's been quite a year for Freeport. I really hope you and your families and colleagues are staying safe and well. We've all made personal sacrifices. It's been a tough year for us at Freeport, the progress our company has made has really been a godsend as we've all been working in ways that are so different than in past. We remain focused on working to protect our health and safety of our people. We're supporting the communities where we operate during this crisis and we are really encouraged by the scientific advances with therapeutics and now that vaccines are finally being distributed. But we know all this is going to take time to have the distribution widely placed and we're all looking forward to returning to normal lives. But for the time being, we are staying diligent with our protocols and these have really proven to be so effective for us at Freeport. I'm immensely proud of our Freeport team for their response to the COVID challenge, navigating through a pandemic like this that none of us of ever seen, and was this degree of duration has been difficult for everyone and all the communities around us. Our team has demonstrated real resilience, confidence and drive throughout all of this, come together to address the situation proactively, while we've maintained focus on continuing to protect and enhance our business and that's worked for the benefit of all stakeholders. On Slide 3, we show the highlights for 2020, a year of extraordinary accomplishment for Freeport. We laid a strong foundation for future growth in cash flows and profitability, which is exactly what we set out to do and had a strategy to do. And to have been able to achieve what we did in the face of COVID, is nothing short of remarkable. Earlier in 2020, we announced in April, we moved quickly to develop new operating protocols to maintain our business' continuity. We totally redesigned our operating plans from what we had announced this time a year ago to safeguard our business, protect our liquidity, and to be responsive to the really heightened uncertainty that we were facing and everyone was facing. At Freeport, all hands were on deck to build an optimal plan. Each of our operating teams around the globe played an important role in developing and then executing these aggressive plans. We just had a tremendous end by everyone and that enabled us to execute the plan so well. Big positive from this process that our team's collaboration, which has always been a strength of our organization is now more strong than it's ever been. Employment engagement, commitment, energy, and morale are at very high level. We effectively executed the revised plans, had a big focus on cost and capital management, and then, significantly, we advanced the largest block caving operation in the world at our Grasberg mine in Indonesia. You will see we met our key milestones for this massive multi-year, multi-billion dollar undertaking. At the same time, we also completed on time and on budget the Lone Star project in Arizona, and this is a potential future keystone asset for our Company. The progress we made this year set the foundation for strong cash flows literally for years to come. We turned the corner during 2020 to begin generating sustainable and substantial free cash flow. Beginning in the third quarter of 2020 and now continuing in the fourth quarter and as we look forward, we've generated and are generating significant free cash flow and that enabled us to reduce our net debt by $2.4 billion in the second half of the year. Slide 4 highlights key financial metrics by comparing our actual results for 2020 with the plan we presented to you last January prior to the onset of the pandemic. So this is not the revised April plan, but the one that we had before we knew what we were facing. In that comparison, our unit net cash costs for 2020 were 15% lower than the January 2020 guidance. EBITDA and operating cash flow improved by over 25%, capital spending was reduced by 29%. We also generated approximately $550 million in after-tax proceeds from the sale of non-cash flow producing assets that we disposed of this year. We ended the year with $2.7 billion lower debt than our original January plan. Think about that. Facing COVID, with all the uncertainties, having to make the changes, and then, coming back to do so much better than we set out to do before COVID was known about. This was accomplished in an average copper price realization of $2.95 for the year, to $0.10 per pound, well below the current price, the team did an outstanding job. We're strongly positioned for the future. In addition to the strong operating and financial performance in 2020, we achieved new milestones in the ESG area and that's shown on Slide 5. We committed to the Copper Mark. This is a new assurance framework developed by the International Copper Association and our Steve Higgins is now the President of ICA to promote and demonstrate responsible production practices focusing on meeting the United Nations' sustainability development goals. Big step forward. We established climate targets and added transparency with a new Climate Report, which is now available on our website. We took a leading role with ICMM, International Council of Metals and Mining, beginning over a year ago when it served as the industry representative in a multi-stakeholder initiative to develop a new tailing standard for the mining industry following the disasters in Brazil and then the subsequent development of implementation guidance for ICMM members. This was a major undertaking by the industry and by our Company, which took a lead in the process, and it reflects the importance of managing tailings storage facilities safely and responsibly. After serving two terms as Chairman of ICMM more than 10 years ago, I recently accepted a new term as Chairman. ICMM currently has 27 CEO Council Members from the largest global mining and metals companies, and I'm leading a strategic review of the organization to meet the increasing importance of ESG issues facing our industry. We advanced our inclusion and diversity initiatives which is core to our values at Freeport. We invest in our communities and continued to expand organizational resources in this effort. Workers' safety is our highest priority and we show that with what we did in response to COVID. Our safety statistics in 2020 measured by incidence rates met our targets. Fatality position continues to be a focus of our work safety management and regrettably, we had five fatalities in our operations last year. On Slide 6, you've heard me say for a long time that the copper price would benefit from its favorable fundamental outlook. Prices rose significantly in late 2020 in recognition of copper's favorable demand trends and the limited ability of the industry to increase supply. The recent price move is significant, but note that prices are still lower than they were just over 10 years ago or almost 10 years ago. Arguably, the fundamental outlook for copper today is better than it was 10 years ago. China is leading the recovery and global stimulus measures in countries around the world are also being positive for growth in copper demand. Freeport is a leading producer of copper and this commodity is critical to the economy of the future. It's essential to support global growth and broad scaled economic activity, but it is also essential and strategic for technologies required for the transition to a global, cleaner energy future that's on the front burner for everyone. More and more, we're seeing adoption of policies to reduce carbon emissions around the globe. 70% of the world's copper supply is used to deliver electricity. As clean energy initiatives are implemented, the intensity of copper use will increase. The chart on Slide 7 shows that copper utilization in electric vehicles and in the generation of renewable power is more than 4 times greater per unit than for our traditional vehicles and power generation. CRU estimates that copper demand for electrification and renewables will increase significantly over the coming years. In a relatively short timeframe, global demand just from these green initiatives could approximate the size of today's U.S. copper market. As demand accelerates, copper supply will continue to struggle to keep up and this supports the favorable near-term and long term fundamental outlook. As current situation echoes the early 2000s, when I became CEO of Freeport at a time when Chinese demand appeared and accelerate in such a dramatic fashion without a supply response, which created the commodity super cycle and sharp increases in copper prices very similar to what we're facing today. Turning to Indonesia on slide 8, our PTFI team is delivering really impressive results. During 2020, we built the momentum for the ramp up of our massive underground mines and by the fourth quarter, we had reached nearly 70% of the targeted annual run rates for sales volumes. This is something we were looking forward to beginning in the mid-1990s when we designed the original pit, which is now completed, and it's something that we've been investing in over the past 15 years. And to see it coming together like it is, is truly gratifying. And Mark Johnson and his team have just done an exceptional job. Continued growth during 2021 is expected to enable us to reach our full annualized targets by the end of this year. Considering the operating health challenges we faced in Papua, this is notable and striking. The team stayed on schedule, met our objectives, the project is massive and complex, and we did this by designing and maintaining effective COVID protocols for a very large workplace in a very challenging remote location. Our progress with the ramp-up has reduced risk for PTFI's underground mines significantly. The major risk as we started this was developing the infrastructure. Infrastructure is in place. There is always risk in mining. It's inherent in our business, but the major risks for this underground development are behind us and we are confident and have a track record of managing the types of risk we will be facing going forward. We can't make them go away, but we can manage them. And so we're really pleased with where we stand with that process. We are also continuing discussions currently regarding the new smelter in Indonesia. In early 2020, requested a delay in the agreed time schedule for completing of construction of the new smelter at a site in Eastern Java near Gresik, which is near the existing PT smelting facility. We haven't been able to progress work there because of COVID issues for the local workforce and international contracts. This is a greenfield smelter with a total cost of about $3 billion. That number continues to be refined and changed, and this project would be debt-financed but PTFI, the Indonesian entity. Over the last several months, PTFI and our partner and majority shareholder of PTFI, the Indonesian state-owned company MIND ID have been discussing with the government alternatives to this commitment to build a new smelter which was reflected in our IUPK mining license granted in December 2018. During the fourth quarter, we advanced discussions within the majority owner of the existing PT smelting facility at Gresik for a 30% expansion to add smelting capacity in Indonesia and partially satisfy our commitment to the government. Commercial and financing discussions with these expansions are being advanced, engineering is in progress. Initial estimates indicate that this project could be done for $250 million and be done efficiently in the current TCRC environment and it would partially meet our obligation to the government. Then separately, at the request of the government, PTFI is currently engaged in discussion with a third-party regarding the potential for the development of a new greenfield smelter at an alternate location away from Eastern Java. This project would be in lieu of PTFI's constructing the new greenfield smelter that I mentioned above. A third-party would lead the development for the smelter and arrange its financing. PTFI would commit to be a supplier of concentrate for the project, and the partners and the government are working expeditiously to reach a decision on the path forward. On Slide 10, we show our 2021 priorities for our ongoing efforts in creating values for our Company. We are building on the progress of 2020 by focusing on execution of plans to grow production volumes, manage costs, and capital spending efficiently. We're expanding our recent innovation efforts, supplying technology and innovative management processes in our operations around the world, and all of this, while we manage and are sensitive to our responsibilities to workers, communities, governments and other stakeholders. We look forward to resuming cash returns to shareholders during 2021. And we will be in a position to do that and we will be in discussions with our Board on taking actions. We will be in a period now for the long-term of harvesting cash flows now that we are completing the major long-term investment program in Indonesia. We are discussing with the Board a financial policy that would now enable a near-term resumption of the dividend and then, over time, a performance-based shareholder return policy. Significantly, we have recommenced work we suspended early in 2020 to evaluate and advance future organic growth opportunities from our large portfolio of undeveloped reserves and mineral resources. We look forward to doing that. The efforts of 2020 and work of our team over many years now, has enabled us to increase margins and cash flow substantially for 2021 and beyond. At $3.50 copper, we are on a path to nearly double EBITDA from 2020 levels. Copper sales for 2021 are projected to increase 20% over 2020. Gold volumes are projected to increase by over 50%, our unit net cash cost of production will decline. And this is occurring at a time of improved pricing for copper. I recall in an earlier conference call like this I said, an ideal situation for Freeport would be able to be completing the Grasberg expansion at the time of good copper prices. And here we are. The significantly higher cash flows will enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet, build value in our business. Returns substantial cash flows to shareholders. As shown on Slide 12, we have a long line portfolio of mineral reserves, reserve life for our proved and probable reserves of over 30 years. We have substantial options for the potential to expand our reserve base from our large inventory of mineral resources beyond reported reserves, all of this is associated with brownfield expansions of our existing ore bodies. What this means is that for our Company, to have long-term success, we are not required to have success in exploration. We hope we do. We're not required to do deals. Strategic opportunities may come to us, but we've got this base already in our portfolio that provides for a sustainable long-term future for Freeport. Slide 13 highlights the organic projects we are now assessing. During 2020, to conserve cash, we paused work on our expansion projects. We're now reengaged. Broad range of opportunities. During 2021, we will be developing a ranking of these projects to guide our thinking on sequencing and long-term planning. We have no plans to increase substantially capital spending on projects in the near term, but in the long-term, these growth opportunities will be approached in a measured and disciplined way. I'll close with Slide 14, which I have titled the Freeport Edge, which is a term we're using internally around our Company. Our management team at Freeport has extensive experience in managing this business. The leadership teams across the Company are seasoned, value-oriented, and intensely engaged. We have a management structure that is collaborative and experienced in working together and we're decisive, make a decision we execute. We recognize our responsibilities we undertake when we are granted harder and licensed to operate and we never cut corners on important issues. Looking at our team at Freeport, it's a combination of management with long tenure and experience. We also have a cadre of younger managers who bring new ideas, approaches and energies. We have strategic new hires, who bring outside perspectives. We've had three senior executives who've retired at the end of their careers over the last two years. Internal replacements were promoted and are performing effectively. And this just demonstrates the depth of talent in our organization. Freeport is foremost in copper. Our portfolio of assets is large, high-quality, well-established industry leader, operate mines that are among the largest in the world. Our assets have long lives and durable with embedded options, reserve, resource growth. We have strong operating franchises in the United States, South America, and Indonesia. We're a reliable supplier to the global copper industry. We have industry-leading technical capabilities, supported by our strong track record of project execution and business management over many years. We have earned the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, suppliers, financial markets, and most importantly, our workers, communities and host countries where we operate. Our block caving experience is among the most extensive and long-standing in the history of the global mining industry. We've been operating block caves in Indonesia since the early 1980s. We have an important molybdenum block caving operation in Colorado. And this is critically important as we transition Grasberg to be termed the largest block caving operation in the world. I'll close before turning to your questions by thanking our people and recognizing their strength, resiliency, and performance. I'm proud to be part of this team and I look forward to continue to be part of the team and to participate in our future successes. We will build on our accomplishments. As will be depicted on our 2020 Annual Report to shareholders, we are charging ahead responsibly, reliably, and relentlessly. Thank you for your attention. And operator, let's open the lines for questions. Kathleen Quirk : Richard, I'm just going to make a few comments, and then, we can take the questions. I'll be brief. Just continuing with the slide presentation on Slide 16, we provide some additional details on the quarter and our operating plans. We are continuing in the U.S. to ramp up production from the new Lone Star mine, and in January of this year, we commenced the restart of the Chino mine, which we had previously announced. In South America, we're continuing to operate Cerro Verde at a reduced rate of roughly 360,000 tons per day. We did a little more than that in the fourth quarter and our team is prepared to increase rates to a level of 400,000 tons, which is about where we were - tons per day, which is about where we were pre-COVID after the COVID restrictions are lifted. At El Abra, we've incorporated in our latest plans an increase in operating rates, which will provide additional volumes beginning in 2022. And as we've talked about, at Grasberg, we made excellent progress in the fourth quarter and are continuing to execute the ramp up plan to achieve the targeted metal run rates by the end of this year. Slide 17, we present the outlook for 2021. The guidance is largely in line with our previous estimates. We made some minor revisions to 2021 volumes. These were largely timing in nature to reflect the latest Grasberg mine plans. And we've updated our cost models to incorporate the current pricing for energy, currencies, and ongoing maintenance programs. We expect to sell just over 3.8 billion pounds of copper in 2021 at an average unit net cash cost of $1.25 per pound. At $3.50 copper, this will generate about $8 billion of EBITDA and $5.5 billion in operating cash flows for the year 2021, which is nearly double the 2020 levels. And as you'll see, we expect further growth in 2022 and 2023, which is shown on Slide 18, where we provide a three-year outlook for volumes. After stacking growth of nearly 20% in copper and over 50% for gold in 2021 versus 2020, we're projecting further growth of 13% in copper volumes and over 20% in gold volumes for the year 2022. And these projects have been in development for some time. Most of the capital is behind us, which gives us a runway here of generating growth in cash flows and margins. The build-up in volumes for 2021 is reflected on Slide 19. And on Slide 20, we show the significance of the cash flow generation using these volumes and our cost estimates, and we show a range of prices from $3.50 to $4 copper, holding gold flat at $1,850 per ounce and molybdenum at $9 per pound. But you can see that the growth in volumes at very low incremental cost results in EBITDA ranging from over $10 billion per annum on average for the years 2022 and 2023. So over $12 billion per year at $4 copper and operating cash flows, which are net of our taxes and interest costs, would range from $7 billion at $3.50 per pound of copper to over $8.5 billion at $4 copper. And as Richard was mentioning, $4 copper is still well below historical periods of demand strength. The cash flows generation are expected to be significantly above our planned capital spending, which will provide substantial free cash flows as we go forward. Slide 21 includes our projected capital of $2.3 billion in 2021. That excludes potential spending on the Indonesian smelter, which would be debt-financed and is still under evaluation. We are maintaining our basic capital plans. We have been very disciplined about capital spend. The 2021 capital is roughly, as you'll see, about $100 million higher than the previous forecast and that incorporates an acceleration of some mining equipment investments to provide capacity assurance for our plans. We are in a strong financial position, as you see. We've entered a period of exceptional free cash flow generation. The long-lived asset base and ongoing cost and capital management will provide the ability to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, provide cash returns to shareholders and build additional values in our asset base. Regarding financial policy, we're working with our Board on a shareholder return policy that would balance our priorities, while providing increasing returns to shareholders based on this performance. It's a very exciting time for Freeport. And we're staying very focused on continuing our momentum. And now, operator, we'd like to take questions. Richard Adkerson : Kathleen, apologize for not - comments. I wasn't trying to cut you out. Okay. Let's have some questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs. Emily Chieng : Hi, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter here. The first question I had is just really around digging into some of the capital allocation strategy plans we had again. Are you able to provide any narrowed timing or key financial metrics and operational targets that you're looking for ahead of thinking about raising the dividend or around when we might see some movement on growth projects longer-term looks like 2021 is still very much a harvest year, but any kind of guidelines on that would be great? Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Okay. So with respect to the dividend, we're already there. We just \u2013 we have a - we'll have Board meetings early this year and we are going to sit down with the Board about a broader long-term financial policy that I made referenced to, and we'll be in a position to recommend to the Board to reinstate the dividend. But there is no need for further financial metrics with that new look at our improved financial situation Over when we were paying the dividend before. The issue with the growth project is one that requires more work and requires some time in evaluating the market as we go forward. They range in size, but the projects are large ones. We have a significant expansion opportunity in El Abra, in Chile, with our partner Codelco. And it's - on the order of the project, we did Cerro Verde several years ago. And we have series of projects in the U.S. that initially aren't as large, although down the road, there are some very large ones available. The U.S. has some advantages. Tax rates are very favorable and we have a very large loss carry forward. So we don't pay taxes in the U.S. for years to come. We own most of the lands and fees. So there is no royalties. And so when you cut out taxes and royalties in the U.S. versus foreign economics and with the favorable energy situation in the U.S., and community support for workers, there's just a lot of advantages there. So we had to suspend this work because of the uncertainties of COVID. We\u2019re now - Rick Coleman and his team are digging back into it and we are going to be doing trade-offs of these individual projects as we go forward in 2021 and we are able to report to you about our intentions. We are constantly approached by others in the industry who would like to be our partners in these projects. So there'll be a lot of opportunities there. And just to say, today, we are just resuming the work that we were engaged in previously. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Chris LaFemina : Hi, Richard, Kathleen, and thank you for taking my call. Just two questions regarding Grasberg. The first is, it looks like for the Grasberg block caves, you've made a pretty material increase to your annual production guidance from 850 million pounds at average reserve grade to 950 million pounds, and I'm wondering what is driving that increase by 100 million pounds of annual production from the Grasberg block cave? That's my first question. Richard Adkerson : All right. Well, we\u2019re - the Grasberg block cave has gone extraordinarily well. I mean, it's an ore body that we knew well because it's the same ore body that we mined from the early 1990s to December 2019. So we know the ore body. It doesn't have some of the pressure situations that we've had to deal with at the Deep MLZ mine. And so when you just look at the advancement of the block caving operations, the development of draw bells and the way we've operated, we're just ahead of schedule. So it's nothing more than the team being very efficient, being ahead of schedule. Chris LaFemina : Okay. It's nothing to do with surprise in terms of grades and looks like the average grade for the reserve is higher than it was the last time you reported results. So is there something different in terms of the mine plan or just some of the drilling you have done there where you've seen some different results than you expected? Richard Adkerson : No. It's just, as you mine an ore body and go forward, it's a dynamic situation and you update mine plans and reserves for the experience in the - it's just great to see the Grasberg block cave having this really positive development mode. I mean it's just special. Chris LaFemina : Okay. Thanks for that. And then secondly on Indonesia in terms of the smelter. So the options here are number one, you build a new smelter, which I think you've said in the past, would cost up to $3 billion. You'd fund effectively half of that. Obviously, debt financed through the asset, but half of that that will be attributable to Freeport. The other option is to expand the Gresik smelter, build the precious metals refinery and have a third-party build the smelter. If a third-party - so my first question is, in that second scenario, that's $200 million for the smelter expansion, maybe $250 million for a precious metals refinery, so $500 million in total, of which you pay about half. Is that correct? Richard Adkerson : Well, let me pick on a few words that you just said. Chris LaFemina : Okay. Richard Adkerson : First of all, Freeport - FCX, let's call the U.S. company FCX, the Indonesian entity PTFI, okay? We are a shareholder of PTFI. We own 49% of the shares. We have rights to operate under a shareholders' agreement, we be an FCX. MIND ID owns 51%. So it's a separate entity and it is the entity that would construct and finance the smelter. So it's no 50/50 sharing. I mean it is - it'd be financed in that entity, it's a substantial entity, with no external debt. From time-to-time, there is some borrowings from FCX, but \u2013 to meet working capital needs, but it's a substantial entity that clearly can debt finance this entity on its own. So that's the way this thing would be approached and financed. Now, we do consolidate that entity because of our operating rights. It's a very positive thing that we do have the ability to do that under the accounting rules because that way we can report it as part of our global operations. So to the extent that alternative is followed and PTFI takes the lead in constructing and financing the smelter, the debt that it incurs would be consolidated on our balance sheet, but it wouldn't be obligations of FCX to provide funding for it. Chris LaFemina : Right. Understood. So in that scenario, PTFI would pay $500 million for a precious metal refinery and the expansion of the Gresik smelter. Whereas in the other scenario, where you build the smelter, PTFI would effectively spend $3 billion, right? So and then in a scenario, where you just expand the smelter, build the precious metal refinery and have a third-party build the second \u2013 the separate smelter, would there be a risk here? Will you be paying materially above market TCRC to that smelter or how should we think about the cost to you of not building the smelter? Richard Adkerson : So let me go back to one step. By expanding Gresik, we could downsize the greenfield smelter that PTFI would build, and the $3 billion number would be adjusted to be offset with the additional cost of the expansion. So at this point, I think it's fair to still consider - we may have ways of reducing the capital and we are working towards those, but to think about both those projects together and the precious metal facilities, all being a $3 billion project for PTFI. Now, this new alternative would result in not having to build the greenfield smelter. Another party would come in and do that, arrange it and finance it, so the debt would not be incurred by PTFI Okay. We're still in the process of negotiating TCRC rates for that. There will be some need for financial support because of the market, but there is an opportunity for us to end up in a much more favorable situation for PTFI if we are successful in these negotiations. And the government considers it positive because it would be a step in their own government initiatives to develop industry in Indonesia. This would tie into some nickel operations and potentially some downstream battery operations and the like for Indonesia. So strategically, the Government of Indonesia sees its positive. It could be positive for PTFI and so that's the basis for our deal. And now, we're in the process of negotiating the terms of that deal. Kathleen Quirk : And Chris, this is Kathleen. We are really running the processes in parallel so that we can compare the economics of each. We were attracted to the third-party model because that was a model that was successful for us in the past when we built the original smelter. And so we'll be evaluating the economics of that option alongside of the original option as well. So really what we are seeking to do is to do this in the best economic fashion as we can. And the benefit of having a third party doing it is, it allows PTFI to really focus on mine development and upstream, which is what PTFI is really strong at. So we're still in the early stages of evaluating the two alternatives and progressing both of them in parallel to determine which is the best for PTFI and its shareholders. Chris LaFemina : Great. Thank you very much. Richard Adkerson : Chris, I want to close with one thing, one reminder, I say this every time, but I just want to close with it. If we do go forward with our original commitment, build a smelter, just remember that the negative economics of that smelter are borne more than 70% by the Government of Indonesia because of taxes, royalties, their 51% equity ownership in PTFI. And so in essence, less than 30% of the negative economics of the smelter come back to FCX through its 49% share holding in PTFI. Many people seem to be assigning more negative value for FCX to this smelter than the economics really justify. Chris LaFemina : All right. Sure. Thanks. Richard Adkerson : And that's why we are aligned with the government in trying to make this as economic as possible. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Alex Hacking : Good morning, Richard and Kathleen, and congrats on all the achievements last year. Richard Adkerson : Thanks, Alex. Alex Hacking : So my question is around CapEx. If we look back to the beginning of last year, you were going to spend $2.8 billion last year and $2.4 billion this year, ended up spending $2 billion and $2.3 billion. So effectively $1 billion has been cut out of CapEx over that two-year period or roughly 20%. No one in the financial markets is complaining about that. But I guess, could you help us understand where that money has gone? Is it deferred in a sense or is that money that is effectively not going to be spent, or does it reflect FX and other effective changes to the price and cost of things, if that question makes sense? Thanks. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. Part of the capital that we deferred in 2020 was related to the smelter. So that's something, as we've been talking about on this call, is still uncertain, but there was significant capital that we did cut in 2020. And we cut mining rates, we deferred some projects and we're still operating under those conditions. We did bring forward, - as I mentioned, we brought back in $100 million of mine equipment really allowing us to do some rebuilds more quickly than what was in the April plan and those would have been in the original plan. So some of it is timing related, and some of it really is just trying to be as efficient as possible with our equipment fleets. And that's one of the benefits that we have by operating all these mines is, planning the equipment for fleets where they bring the highest value, moving - we can move equipment from different sites to benefit from just being able to operate them together. And we're also just really trying to work the assets, use this technology that we have and the organizational improvement initiatives, to work the assets harder. And we started that program, what we called America's Concentrator, but it applies not just to milling operations but mining operations and really looking to improve the lives of our equipment, improve tire lives, all those things really add up. And so, yes. There is always tension and pressure of people wanting to invest more in our mining equipment, in our mining business, but we're really taking a very disciplined approach and using the learnings that we gained in 2020 and even prior to that, to try to drive better capital efficiency in the business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America. Timna Tanners : I just wanted to ask about two things. One is on the cost side. It crept up a little bit and some people are asking about that. So I just wanted to understand, it seems like you made it clear that that was energy and currency, maybe some other issues. But does that also incorporate some of the cost-containment measures that you had, is that fixed or could it change as the year progresses with currency and other efficiencies? That's one question. And the other question is just to ask about Richard's plans because I know Richard you told me you're going to pursue another term like President Trump and that you're going to let us on the Indonesia progress. And so those are behind us now and you took on another term with ICMM. So just wondering if you could give us a few updated thoughts there as well. Thanks. Richard Adkerson : Well\u2026 Kathleen Quirk : Yes. On the first question on - you want to go first, Richard? Richard Adkerson : No, I was just going to - I will let you give the details, but Timna, you look back over time, some of our costs are correlated to the copper price. We have profit sharing for our workforce in Peru. So the more money we make there, the more our labor cost goes there. We've seen an uptick in energy cost recently from where they were earlier. So just inevitably, as the copper prices rise, we have some increases in unit costs and we are able to offset those, but not completely eliminate them through our cost efficiencies. But Kathleen, you go ahead or maybe you want to answer the second question too, Kathleen. Kathleen Quirk : But no, I think you captured it, Richard. We updated our model for all the current rates in terms of energy. We've seen some energy, some oil price increase. Although the price of oil relative to copper is still very low, we have seen some increases in oil prices which affects some of our energy costs. We've had some increase in electricity costs. Richard mentioned profit sharing, but we updated our budgets to reflect all of the input costs that vary. But from a bottom-line standpoint, we are continuing to drive the benefits that we got in 2020 through these revised plans and really working to hold on to these cost savings. We learned a lot and we always say that necessity is the mother of invention and we learned a lot during 2020. And so basic cost structure, we're working to preserve, but we do have some variability with input costs. But it's something that we're just continuing to focus on as main driver of cost and capital efficiency in the business. It's really important in the Americas because that we have such leverage to the copper price and we really want to maintain as low cost as possible and we've got programs in place that are working on that every day. Richard Adkerson : So Timna, since I made that comment about Trump at your conference, we now have an older President than Trump. So maybe that extends my time frame. Personally, we've been through such a situation at Freeport really over my 30 years being here, but particularly over the last 10 years. And now that we are seeing the positive results of all of this work and particularly the recovery we made from five years ago, I'm healthy, I want to be part of it. I really enjoy and love the people I work with and we just have this incredible good spirit among our team. I do have a concern. That's why I made some of the comments on the last slide. Some people look at me and safe Freeport's an old company, maybe, but we really - if you look throughout our organization, we have a lot of young, experienced managers. With our longer-tenured people, we have great depth. We're showing we can sustain positions. When I do leave, we're going to have a sustainable company going forward, we're going to have a sustainable Board. We're working on that now. So anyway, it's been a crazy year for someone who traveled all the time to be working like I've worked - like how other people worked. But having the success with the Company which is not just a peak thing or an unusual thing, but this is - you look at the markets, inventories are low, there is elements of copper demand that are new, that are growing, supplies. I mean all of this is coming in place. And I think it's going to be - it was a great year for Freeport. I mean, we went from below $5 a share to be in the 8th best-performing stock in the S&P 500. I mean, how can you envision that. I mean that's a head spinner, but I think there is great things to come, and I want to be here and be part of it because we've worked so hard to get there. I should mention that Jim Bob died recently. He and I - I met him in my first year out of college as he was starting off McMoran and we were two different people, but we established a very good partnership. We brought different skills to bear in building Freeport. And in his later years, Jim Bob was focused on his oil and gas concepts, but he was always there. We did have a major disagreement. I mean, there is no way to hide it. Over the oil and gas deal in 2011, he thought it was a really good deal for the Company. I did not. The Board decided to do it and it caused us significant problems when commodity prices fell. He was very sick for a while, but I'm happy to say that in recent years, he and I established - in recent times he and I reestablished a really good personal relationship. And it was a sad day for all of us when he lost his life to COVID. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Chris Terry : Hi, Richard and Kathleen, hope you guys are well. I just wanted to dig into Grasberg a little bit further, given it so pivotal. Just talk about the December - the fourth quarter development rates, and then, how you exited the year? And then as you've put your 2021 guidance in place, whether you see those estimates potentially still conservative versus how well you went on the development rights in 2020? Richard Adkerson : Well, Mark's here. And Mark, I'll say a couple of things and maybe you can chime in. We have four underground mines there. The two major ones are the Grasberg block cave and the Deep MLZ, and each of those have separate headings. So this is not like a single mine or even two major mines, but a collection of mines with a common infrastructure. And as we've developed the access to the ore bodies and expanded those, that gives us a lot of flexibility to deal with operating issues that may come up with particular sections of the mine where we are mining. And maybe things like that will come up, wet muck, and so forth. We haven't had much of that yet. But here's where we are. We mentioned just how well Grasberg block cave is going and we are ahead of schedule on that. Grasberg - the Deep MLZ mine has had the challenges over time with having these seismicity events that are mining-related not natural. And we've implemented a program of using fracking technology to pre-condition the ore bodies so that could leave the pressures that cause these. We still face them from time-to-time, but we've got great procedures for dealing with it. There are different ore bodies, different settings. The Grasberg block cave is ahead. Deep MLZ is maybe a month or two behind. But Mark talk us little bit about your perceptions on how we're dealing with the Deep MLZ? Mark Johnson : Yes. Chris, Deep MLZ, as Richard mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we were ahead on all the development aspects. We are on target on draw belling, undercutting. And where we had some challenges was in just the material flow. And what I mean from there, is taking the material from the extraction level, getting it through the rock breaker, getting it to the grizzlies, through the internal ore passes, the 60-meter long ore passes and getting them into the trucks to take it to the crusher. The problems that we had there was, we deal everything from very, very cause rocky material to fine sticky material and we're coming up with methods that I'm confident will address that, that allow us to take both the big stuff and the fine stuff and run them through these ore passes. It's something that we saw at the initial stages of DOZ, and we're working our way through that. On the GBC, the Grasberg block cave, we had a very good year. We were on draw billing undercutting. We were ahead on our tonnage rates for the fourth quarter, marginally ahead and we're in a good position there. We build our second - we will complete the second pressure GBC in April of this year, which will be a major milestone. We continue to develop the rail haulage and that is a major milestone that we will achieve in the second quarter and let these trains run in a loop rather than out and back, and that's going to increase our production from our overall mine system. So both mines are tracking well. And as Richard mentioned, we do have DOZ. It's a mature mine, but it hit targets. Big Gossan our stope mine, was - we had very good results this last year, last quarter, in particular. So we've had some pluses and minuses, but overall, we're in a very good position entering this year. And particularly in the GBC, we've hit our peak in our draw belling in 2020. And just associated with mine plan and consistent with our long-range plans, that starts to tail off. We don't need as many draw bells to continue to sustain the ramp-up in production. Deep MLZ will pretty much stay steady for the next three years on draw belling and undercutting. So the next two years is really just doing more of the same, of growing these mines. There is no real rate increase in the amount of development. In fact, it's flatter or dropping off. And it's just a matter of continuing to be very consistent in how going forward as to what we've been able to demonstrate over the last couple of years and particularly in 2020. Richard Adkerson : And our volumes will be increasing. I mean we are 75%, 80% there now, but that will increase long-term. And what we try to do with our publicly disclosed guidance is be realistic. We don't try to do anything other than give you our current plans and what they are, and we will do better than that sometimes and sometimes, we may not. We also have an undeveloped ore body that we've been doing some work on that could add value for the future and that's an ore body called the Kucing Liar. It\u2019s ore body with high-grade material, has some pyrite in it. Mark and his team have come up with a revised plan to deal with that. It's about a $5 billion project spread over many years, a number of years in the future, but that's not near-term, but it's something that within the timeframe of our current IUPK will be something that will sustain and add value for PTFI Chris Terry : Thanks, Richard. And I appreciate the color Mark. Just one other follow-up on smelter. In terms of the Gresik ownership being 25% Freeport and 75% Mitsubishi and Nippon, just in terms of the expansion that could take place there, I just wanted to be clear, the JV partners that you have there, they are comfortable doing the expansion on that asset, right? Kathleen Quirk : We have been working with the majority partner there and they would lead the development of the project and we will work out the ownership as we go forward. But the structure that we're talking about is that, PTFI would advance the funds to the smelter company as a loan and potentially convert that into equity after the smelter is completed. But Mitsubishi Materials would lead the project to develop the expansion. They've done multiple expansions there since the smelter was constructed in the mid-'90s. They are excellent, excellent operators and very efficient in terms of capital management. So we're working with them to lead the expansion. Richard Adkerson : Yes. And I'll just echo, I was involved with the structure for the original smelter development in the '90s, and Mitsubishi has just been an excellent partner. They couldn't have been better. They operate the smelter in a first-class way. The world of smelters has changed so much. In those days at Grasberg, we couldn't find places to place our concentrate. So we bought a smelter in Spain. We worked to build the smelter in Indonesia. The world has changed. There is such a global excess capacity of smelters, but Mitsubishi has been there through thick and thin and have just done remarkably good job. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Orest Wowkodaw : Just following up on the Indonesian smelter alternative. Do you anticipate that the ultimate plan is going to be resolved call it in the next six to 12 months and then, along that do you - sorry. Go ahead Richard\u2026 Richard Adkerson : The answer to that is, yes. Orest Wowkodaw : So, it's fairly closer? Richard Adkerson : Well, it needs to be. I mean, we've got this deadline that we're working with the government to extend a year, but we have to get on with the Gresik area smelter or go along with this other thing, the government is in it. So it's going to be resolved clearly within that timeframe. Orest Wowkodaw : Okay. And do you anticipate under any of these alternatives actually spending capital this year or is it more likely going to start, call it, like 2022? Kathleen Quirk : We'll have some capital for the PT smelting expansion. It will be advanced as a loan. And they're doing the engineering now. We don't have definitive agreements with them, but we're very close to that. And again, any of the funding - we are planning to raise financing, debt financing, we've got discussions with banks about financing for that. And then on the larger smelter, it really will just depend on which alternative. One would be the third-party doing it, and we potentially could be a minority equity owner like we were in the PT Smelting project. Or the greenfield would involve some spending in 2021, but not significant. But as Richard said, we need to get the clarity over the next - here over the next several months to make a decision on which path to follow. Orest Wowkodaw : Okay. Wonderful. Richard Adkerson : Again, to be clear, when Kathleen says we, in that context, it's PTFI. Orest Wowkodaw : Right. Richard Adkerson : Okay. Orest Wowkodaw : And then just as a follow-up, is it fair to say that like Freeport is in no rush to begin constructing kind of new copper capacity on a greenfield level, but we're going to see more discipline, not just by Freeport but by the industry this time? Richard Adkerson : Well, we are certainly in no rush. I do think it's a great asset of our Company, but we are not - we are going to continue our focus on getting this project in Indonesia completed and that's going to be - and running our Americas business efficiently and increasing volumes when we can and controlling costs and so forth. So there's certainly no rush. In the industry itself, there are some projects that were begun and delayed because of COVID. Over time, those are going to be completed, but you don't see any evidence of a big rush to start investments. And I don't expect that to occur. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carlos de Alba with Morgan Stanley. Carlos de Alba : So a couple of questions if I may. The first one is maybe Richard, has the management team come out with some potential proposal for the Board in terms of the shareholders' program that you would like to discuss, and hopefully, implement? And if so, if you could share some of what you and your team are thinking that would be great? And the second question is coming back to the DMLZ. The forecast, or at least the open draw bells blasted that our forecast for the end of 2021 and during 2022 came down. So maybe for Mark, is there this impact of the challenges that you are seeing with the material flow what explain this reduction in your open draw bells forecast for this year and next year? And also, what is behind the small reduction in copper and gold sales from PTFI in 2021? Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Mark, why don't you answer first, and I'll come back to the financial policy? Mark Johnson : Yes. There is not any issue on the draw bell opening. If there was a reduction, it's very, very minor. We've been very consistent. We ended the fourth quarter with 15 draw bells within the Deep MLZ blasted and that's going to be relatively our flat rate. There might have been some ones or twos that are different, but it's not anything that was significant in our forecast. As Richard mentioned it's more about this, where we are in the ramping up of the tons and it's more in line. Any changes in the tonnage is more a reflection of this material flow, challenge that we're undertaking. But it's just marginally behind and at the same time, the GBC is marginally ahead. And so the, ramp-up rates are very consistent from one forecast to the other. Some slight changes in grades that are nothing significant, it's not drilling results, it's not any changes in reserves. It's simply where we're actually drawing. There is some - at the end of every quarter, we reflect what we've done and we built that into what we're doing forward. So there is really no significant change in our underground plans both at Deep MLZ and GBC. The other two mines DOZ and Big Gossan are both very consistent. In fact, in Big Gossan we've changed our stope sequencing a bit. That's going to add some metal. So we continue to look for opportunities and to reflect our actual production and operational over the previous quarters. Richard Adkerson : Yes. And just a side comment, these other two mines that we have look tiny compared with Grasberg block cave and the Deep MLZ, but when you look at underground mines in the industry, those are substantial mines in and of themselves. This copper difference is just a rounding. I mean it's less than 1%. I mean, so we're right on plan for copper. And in the gold things, remember we had higher gold. Now we upgraded our gold for 2022. So every year there is going to be those kinds of adjustments. We're going to try to produce more gold, which we were able to do in 2020, and then we adjust our plans for that. So there is nothing here other than that we are right on our targets and everything is going as planned. The financial policy, I'll go back and say, what I've said before, we have ongoing informal discussions with Board members. We have formal Board members coming up. My anticipation is that there will be a restoration of our dividend and then a financial policy that will give guidance to the market of how we will be dividing cash flows in the future for further debt reduction. Although, quite frankly, we are - If you look at our cash flows that we talked to you about today and a $3.50 copper price, we are down to about $3 billion from net debt at the end of 2022. So we certainly can support higher level of debts. And that means there's plenty of cash to enhance cash returns to shareholders and then, have availability of funds, and depending on how we structure it, for future organic growth projects when we decide to initiate those. So restoration of dividend, financial policy that we will provide for increasing cash returns to shareholder over long-term with funds available for organic growth investments. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Murphy with Barclays. Matthew Murphy : I had a question about some of your innovation initiatives. I guess this time last year you were talking about some specific programs with data science, machine learning that you were going to roll out for something like $150 million, $200 million bucks. Should we consider that embedded in this guidance, or is that a program that's still on pause that might be reinitiated at some point? Kathleen Quirk : We are - and Josh Olmsted is on, he can talk more about it. But we are continuing those projects. We've brought a number of things in-house. We were doing a lot of work externally as well, but we brought a number of those initiatives in-house. We're still progressing with some of the automated models that help predict better mill throughput rates and help develop the right recipe to maximize throughput through the mills and we are adopting a lot of the data analytics in other areas as well. We're working on adopting the data analytics process in our leach operations as well. So we are continuing and the team is very actively involved in using technology and digitalization to enhance performance. We're not - the Cerro Verde increase, we're not doing that now because of the COVID restrictions and expect to continue to look at driving mill rates higher there beginning next year. But Josh, why don't you just talk a little bit about it, because it's really an exciting area that Josh and his team are working on actively every day. And it may not look exactly the same as what we were talking about at the beginning of last year, because we've learned a lot and we're improving it from there, but the bottom line to answer your question is, yes. We have built in a lot of it into these plans, but there is upside from there. Josh, you want to add anything to that? Richard Adkerson : Hi Kathleen, let me introduce Josh to the Group, okay, just briefly. Beginning September 1, Josh became our Senior Operating Manager for the Americas, a Senior Vice President. He's been with the Company 28 years and he is only 50 years old or so, but he has progressively risen in the organization, had senior leadership roles at several of our operating sites in the U.S. and South America. And over the past four years, his leadership role has grown as he worked with Red Conger who retired. And he has just been doing a great job and he's brought an energy to. He is very teamwork focused. Our other operating managers are coalescing around him. He works very well with our technical group and with our financial administrative group. So Josh Olmsted, why don't you follow-up Kathleen's comments. Josh Olmsted : Thanks, Richard. Appreciate that. Matthew, just as Kathleen indicated, if we look at year ago when we were talking about Americas concentrate and that $150 million to $200 million investment compared to where we sit today, one of the, I'm going to call it, benefits or one of the things that we took advantage of during 2020 was how do we internalize a lot of that stuff. And as Kathleen alluded to, we took a lot of those learnings and really embedded them in the operation. And that's what allowed us to be as successful as we were in 2020. And as we look at 2021 and beyond, we continue to leverage, whether that be data analytics, the AI and how that applies, the tools that are out there and we look for opportunities, a lot of those things are embedded in the plans today, but I think it's also going to drive additional things as we go forward that won't require the investment or the dollars that we had thought about previously just from the fact that we've got it internalized and we're leveraging a lot of the energy, passion, and excitement of our workforce and tapping into ideas that are allowing us to add incremental benefits across the organization from an efficiency perspective as well as from a cost perspective. And so it's really exciting to see the folks at all levels of the organization have the opportunity and take the opportunity to provide ideas that then turn into significant value for us as an organization. And so, I just continue to be encouraged with our ability to execute on those things and identify opportunities going forward to leverage data, leverage analytics, and put the right information in the right people's hands, at the right time to make good decisions. Richard Adkerson : And back to the point about Freeport operating all the assets, we benefit from all being on the same system. And so this data analytics work that we're doing, really can be compared and shared across the company and collaborate, and really take the best of each of the operations and apply that to the portfolio. And we're starting to do some work with Mark and his team on different things as well. So as Josh was saying, it's really some synergies here and the work that we did in 2020 allowed us really to kind of take some of this on our own and down and drive it. So more to come on that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities. Lucas Pipes : I want to pick up on one of your comments from the prepared remarks regarding how this period is reminding you of the early 2000s. And I think you even mentioned a super cycle. What is your confidence level today that we are on the cusp or maybe already entered a period like this? And then, there were a few questions on M&A, organic growth, and obviously, your conclusion on where we are in the cycle and whether this is another super cycle is of course really important for how you think about these things? So if you could maybe incorporate all these thoughts in a reply would really appreciate your comments on this. Thank you. Richard Adkerson : So we are working remotely, Lucas. If we were sitting as we normally do around our conference desk in Phoenix, Kathleen will be kicking me out on the table because that question is just like giving a monkey a machine gun. 2003, we had gone through a real tough time in copper with the economic issues of the late 1990s, the global recession, the global slowdown. Copper prices had dropped at one point to below $0.70. And I recall and it was at - Timna at a Merrill Lynch conference in Ireland, that was my first conference as CEO. It was right before my CEO and the price of copper had just dipped over $0.70. Nobody in the industry thought it could go beyond $1 within the foreseeable future and everybody was running the business. So what happened? China emerged in a way nobody expected. Created a whole new element of demand. Historically, whenever copper prices jumped up, the industry had projects primarily in Latin America to invest in. And the industry was widely divided and there'll be new investment. Supplies would come on, business cycle with turn down and copper prices withdraw. At this time China added in 2003 a permanent element of new demand that was beyond the traditional demand from copper that was tied into global industrial production. And there was widespread expectation that the industry would invest and add new supplies. I remember my partner Chip Goodyear got up at that conference and said, in the conference, he hope that the price wouldn't rise too much because it would create uneconomic investment. Well, what happened was the industry started looking for new projects then, and geologically, they weren't there and there were all these other barriers to investment. So we had higher prices without a supply response. That led us to do the Phelps Dodge deal in 2007. Our market cap in 2003 was $6 billion. It was $12 billion at the Phelps Dodge. We did a $38 billion business combination, the biggest in the industry. Lived through the financial crisis and then emerged in 2011 as a company with a $60 billion market cap and no debt. So what do we like here? The reason that I feel this is an echo is that we still have a world that's being burdened by the economic slowdown with COVID. While there has been recoveries in pockets of the economy, there has been stimulus by governments and China has recovered much faster than we heard about earlier I think about a world where we had a slow down to the extent we did in 2020, and copper inventories are at levels that we hadn't seen since the mid-2000s. And so here we are and we just talked about how there is not a huge rush to invest in new projects. All the major companies want to grow. Copper is part of their portfolios. That's been the case since the mid-2000s and they've been challenged in doing that. Projects today around the world geologically are more difficult, less quality than they were, underground lower grades. You look at Cerro Verde, [Covid pandemic] these are big low-grade projects that require huge investments in infrastructure and equipment, and mill processing. And then you have these barriers to production that keep some attractive projects in and around the world from going forward. You have political issues in countries that - and Africa is challenged, Latin Americas having political issues, Indonesia has been what it's been. So I do feel that if the world's global economy recovers in a reasonable way, not in an extreme way and we have this big move toward - look at all the stats that are coming about for electric vehicles in the United States. I mean think about what General Motors is doing and what China is doing? You think about the change in the global perception about climate change. In the United States, forest fires, hurricanes, I mean this is something that's going to have to be addressed. And when it is addressed, it's going to require tremendous amounts of infrastructure spending, extraordinary amounts and in all of those elements of spending there is an element of copper of significance into it. So that's why I feel like we are echoing 2003 today. Lucas Pipes : Richard, I really appreciate your expansive answer. Best of luck, and thanks, again. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, Lucas. I think we have time for one more question operator. And for those of you who didn't get questions in, we'll follow up with you. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Curt Woodworth with Credit Suisse. Curt Woodworth : Thanks for fitting me in. Yes, in terms of the super cycle or things like that, in the past, there have been also opportunities for monetization or potentially useful in terms of bringing in JV partners at very accretive terms potentially to develop assets. So to your point, Richard, on Grasberg being derisked, having little net debt by the end of '22. You'd be - you would have the wherewithal to develop maybe multiple projects. I'm just curious how you think about potentially growing the business from a capital-efficient basis going forward, because obviously in the past when you did get into these super cycles, I think, one of the issues in mining industry has been the lack of seeing that cash come back to shareholders. I'm just curious kind of how you balance that going forward? Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : One point, I'll just jump in before Richard comments, we already have growth. I mean if you look at our outlook and Richard touched on this before, not only do we have growth in 2021, but also in 2022. So we've got that and we've got to execute on that plan and that's going to give us a lot of cash flow to be in a position to get some returns back to shareholders after this big investment program. Richard Adkerson : So, again, I look over the shoulder. If you look back at Freeport, when copper prices begin rising in 2003, 2004, we returned tremendous amounts of cash to investors out of Grasberg. We were like a royalty trust or an MLP or something. Then after Phelps Dodge, we delevered very quickly and we start returning and paying dividends again. And we were well positioned in 2011 to continue to do that. The Board decided to invest in oil and gas and took it away. So here we are coming back from the situation that we are now. We don't need a commodities boom to generate lots of cash to return to shareholders. At $3.50 copper you see what the numbers are. I think copper could go much higher than $3.50. I can't guarantee it, but in my gut and Timna that's one of the reasons I want to keep working, I think it's going to be really a special time. And when that happens, we will be able to really return cash to shareholders in a substantial way. This question of investing, I mean, right now, money is so cheap you wouldn't want to bring in a joint venture partner. That may not stay that way forever, but financing is incredibly cheap and available. And I wish Phelps Dodge hadn't given up the interest in the Red Sea or the interest in Cerro Verde. So if we got good projects, we will look at the most efficient way to finance it. That could well be - could be partners because lots of people want to be our partners. And then others may have projects that we have the opportunity to join in on. There could be opportunities in M&A market, but all of that is part of this really bright future that I see for Freeport. The vision right now is focused on getting 2021 to be a successful as 2020 was. And when that happens and we got long-term run rates at Grasberg. Josh and his team has fine-tuned our business in the Americas. We got this Lone Star project, don't overlook that. That could be a new Morenci down the road. This is just a Company that's really well situated to generate cash, not have to do anything to have a sustainable future, but having the world open to us to do lots of different things. It's really, really exciting. Richard Adkerson : All right. Thank you all for participating. We look forward to reporting our progress in 2021. And take care. Take care of yourselves, your families and the people around you. We're not over the hump yet on COVID, but just hang in there. Life is going to get better. Thanks for participating. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan conference call. We released our results this morning and a copy of today's press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our annual report on our Form 10-K. On the call with me today is Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and CEO. We\u2019ve got Mark Johnson, who leads our Indonesian operations. Josh Olmsted, who leads our Americas operations. Mike Kendrick, who leads our Molybdenum business. Steve Higgins, who leads our commercial activities and is our Chief Administrative Officer as well. And Rick Coleman, who leads our project development activities. And I'll start with briefly summarizing our financial results. We will work through our slides and some prepared remarks and then we will take your questions. Today, we reported first quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stock of $718 million and was $0.48 per share and adjusted net income of $756 million, or $0.51 per share after adjusting for net charges totaling $38 million, or $0.03 per share, and a detail of those net non-recurring charges are in the press release on Roman numeral 6. We reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or adjusted EBITDA during the quarter of $2.04 billion and we have got a reconciliation of our EBITDA calculations on Page 36 of our slide deck. In the first quarter of 2021, we had copper sales of $825 million pounds, which approximated our estimate. Our gold production in the first quarter of 2021 was in line with our estimate in January. However, we had a deferral of certain shipments in Indonesia to the second quarter and that resulted in a timing variance for our gold sales. In the first quarter, we benefited from improved pricing. Our first quarter average realized copper price was $3.94 per pound, substantially above the year ago quarter and our gold price of $17.13 per ounce was also above the year ago realized price. We continue to focus on maintaining low-cost position. Our consolidated average June net cost for our copper mines averaged 139 per pound of copper in the first quarter. We generated strong operating cash flows totaling $1.1 billion and that was net of $300 million of working capital uses. And the cash flow has exceeded capital spending, which totaled $370 million during the quarter. As you've seen our Board in February, adapted a new financial policy aligned with our strategic objectives of maintaining strong balance sheet, increasing cash returns to shareholders and advancing opportunities for future growth. We ended the quarter in a strong financial position with $4.6 billion of consolidated cash, $9.8 billion of debt and our net debt - our debt net of cash was $5.2 billion at the end of March. Richard, I'd like to turn the call over to you and we'll start reviewing the slide materials that are on our website. Richard Adkerson : Thanks, Kathleen. I couldn't be more pleased to be able to review with you our first quarter performance and particularly exciting progress we've achieved over the past year where we all faced such uncertainties. It's a special active invigorating time here at Freeport. Our teams are working safely. We remain diligent with COVID as we have successfully executed our operations plans and we're now working on projects for future growth. Our Grasberg underground ramp up is proceeding on schedule. That's key for our strategy. Production in the United States is increasing with our newly commissioned Lone Star mine, the first quarter start - restart of our Chino mine in New Mexico and from increased mine rates where we at Morenci, our flagship mine in the U.S., the largest in North America where we could curtail production a year ago to conserve cash. In South America, we're working to restore production levels to pre-pandemic levels and we'll achieve that over the next 12 months. The Cerro Verde team in Peru and our El Abra team in Chile are doing outstanding work in navigating these issues. We are focusing on sustainability initiatives as all businesses are. This has always been key to Freeport in managing our operations. We are moving to certify each of our operations with a new Copper Mark. This Copper Mark is an industry framework that was recently developed by the International Copper Association to ensure responsible production consistent with UN Sustainable Development Goals. Today, we leave the industry with six of our operations now certified and we're working to get all certified. Going to the slides, I have just a few slides to review with you. On Slide 3, our annual sustainability report has been published and is now available on our website. This is the 20th year we've reported on sustainability. We're working to make it better. I encourage all of you - each of you to read it. We're proud of our good work on sustainability and remain committed to continuous improvement. Past years, we released this report with our annual shareholders at our Annual Shareholders Meeting. We moved it up. We've added new resources to our Freeport team working on sustainability issues. And I congratulate this team for their efforts to make this report available now earlier, so that we can facilitate our expanding engagements with the broad set of constituencies that are now focused on our sustainability performance and initiatives. Last year, we published our initial report on climate. Our 2021 report is forthcoming. We\u2019ve recently published our annual report to shareholders with what I think is a great thing charging ahead responsibly, reliably, and relentlessly. This theme portrays where we are currently positioned at Freeport as a leading and growing global copper producer. We are determined to succeed and operate responsibly and the Freeport tradition will be relentless in the execution of our strategy. Slide 4. First quarter production was in line with our targets. We increased our 2021 sales guidance to 3.85 billion pounds of copper and our 2022 volumes to 4.4 billion pounds. The Grasberg ramp up that I referenced earlier continues to progress in a simply outstanding fashion. We've now achieved 75% of our annualized targeted long-run metal production run rate. We're on track to be at 90% by the third quarter and full rates by year-end. After all these years of hard work, reporting this progress is simply a highlight of my career. The credit though goes to our team on the ground in Indonesia supported by our global team of technical experts. This is a historical major accomplishment as we've converted, as we are in finalizing the conversion of the Grasberg open pit to this massive underground operations. Americas businesses are going well. We are achieving production and cost targets and now we're accurately focusing and working on future growth opportunities, generating strong cash flows, improving our balance sheet. Over the past 12 months, net debt was reduced by over $3 billion to $5.2 billion by the end of this first quarter. But during this period, copper price averaged $3.13. It's now over $4.25. Many are predicting higher prices near-term. Our near-term outlook of copper and gold sales volumes is substantially higher.  Our recent performance this large reduction in debt with lower commodity prices, lower production volumes demonstrates the current strength of our company in generating cash flows. Our strong performance and the positive outlook for our business and the commodities has enabled our board to adopt a new financial policy which will provide increasing cash returns to shareholders while providing flexibility for growth and building a very strong balance sheet. We've also added two new directors David Abney, the retired chairman CEO of UPS with his massive global supply chain operations and Bob Dudley the retired CEO of BP a long time leader in the global extractive industry have joined our board. Each of these men have strong knowledge and experience in global markets and with issues we face in managing our business. Bob and David had many opportunities to join other boards. Their decisions to join our boards is personally gratifying and appreciated. They're really enthusiastic about working with their fellow directors at Freeport and our management team and creating value responsibly for all stakeholders. Moving to Slide 5. Countries around the world responding to COVID with aggressive fiscal and monetary policies. Now this is an important element of near-term demand for copper extending beyond China. China has been the driver of copper demand growth over the past two decades. Now the source of new demand is expanding. In addition to continuing strong copper consumption in China, higher copper consumption in developed countries with COVID recovery initiatives and the increasingly important demand in emerging markets driven by global growth copper now has major new sources of demand from global investments in carbon reduction, infrastructure and expanded technology 5G, Artificial Intelligence and data analytics broadly all require more copper. Importantly copper is essential to the transition to a global cleaner energy future. Roughly 70% of copper is used to deliver electricity. As clean energy initiatives are implemented copper intensity in the economy expands in a major way. The outlook for copper has never been better. Slide 6. Significant demand growth is inevitable. Supply to meet this growth is severely challenged. It's going to require meaningfully higher prices to support mine investment. The combination of rising demand, scarcity of new supplies, point to large impending structural deficits supporting much higher copper prices than previously anticipated. I'm sure you've noted this in recent forecasts by a widening group of industry analysts. Freeport is notably well positioned to benefit from these fundamentals. A leading responsible large-scale producer of copper with near-term and longer-term growth embedded in our portfolio. The scarcity value of a portfolio like ours is unique. It's extremely valuable now and it's going to be even more valuable as large market deficits emerge. Slide 7 highlights our near-term growth. For 2021 copper volumes are anticipated to be 20% higher and gold volumes 50% higher than in 2020, 55% higher than in 2020. Volumes are expected to grow further in 2020 in the 15% to 20% range for both copper and gold. The capital to achieve these near-term higher volumes and the execution risk are largely behind us. Higher volumes with low incremental costs yield expanded margins at prices ranging from $4 to $5 for copper we would generate annual EBITDA for 2022 and 2023 of over $12 billion to the range of $17 billion per annum. That's big numbers. Page 8 describes this new financial policy our board adopted earlier this year. It's designed first to support a strong balance sheet, increase returns to shareholders and provide funds for investments for the future. The current market for copper and its favorable outlook are providing substantial cash flows to meet these objectives as I just outlined. Our board approved a base dividend of $0.30 per annum per share. The first quarter dividend will be paid in May as we resume dividends. After reaching a target net debt in the $3 billion to $4 billion range which at today's prices will do by the end of this year our board's policy establishes a performance-based payout framework for additional cash return to shareholders through dividends and potentially stock buybacks. Returns to shareholders will be determined by allocating available cash flow of up to 50% to shareholder returns and the balance available for future growth and potentially further debt reduction below our target at $3 billion to $4 billion. Our board will assess the additional payout at least annually. With a current level of copper prices and the outlook for copper and gold prices the numbers nor above point to a large cash returns to shareholders with substantial financial resources available for future growth investments. Slide 9 describes some of these growth investments. We have multiple options across our portfolio. We resumed our work that we suspended a year ago because of COVID to evaluate and the timing and the initiation of these opportunities. In the U.S. we're looking at expansions at Lone Star and bagged in and also evaluating opportunities to increase production from [leach] recovery technologies that's really exciting. The Lone Star mine is our newest mine. It's adjacent to our existing operations in southeast Arizona where the companies operate as operations go back to the 1800s. There we have strong community support. We have great relationships with the native American groups. We're evaluating expansions of Lone Star oxides ore which we're now producing and which are growing in terms of the availability of ores but importantly we're also conducting these longer range planning for the development of what looks to be a potentially world-class sulfide resource right in the midst of this historical mining area. At Baghdad in Northwest Arizona we have an opportunity to construct a new concentrator to double production. We have a very long reserve life there. Also there we have strong community support. I keep emphasizing this because that's a challenge for new supply development around the world. We're focused on technology to reduce capital intensity in these projects. [Leach] technology initiatives provide substantial opportunities in this regard to add value all across the portfolio. We're continuing to evaluate an attractive potentially significant expansion of our El Abra mine in Chile, where we're partners with Codelco. This project would require larger investment longer lead times than our U.S. project. Resource is attractive and very large and this signifies that a major future expansion of El Abra is likely. We're evaluating the development of a new deposit an undeveloped deposit at PT-FI in Papuan Indonesia it's called Kucing Liar. This copper gold project involves a large block cave mine using the substantial infrastructure already in place for Grasberg. It would benefit from our expertise and long track record of success in block gating. We're also and this is a lot of fun evaluating a series of interesting investments in projects that support our carbon reduction and other sustainability goals. This involves ideas of developing a new energy generation as clean renewable for our operations in nearby communities and we're advancing plans for exciting projects at Atlanta Cop and Spain to recover valuable metals through recycling electronic devices which again is good from a sustainability standpoint. Now we have these opportunities we're going to be disciplined by making new investments by being selective and measured and deploying capital, focused on value-added investments and do this because we have such long-lived reserves, established license to operate and we're going to work with communities effective by new investments. Slide 10 points to this reserve position. Our reserve life is over 30 years. Now that's proved in probable economically recoverable reserves. In addition we have identified over 100 billion pounds of copper from mineral resources beyond reserves. All part of our existing operations we're going to be working to incorporate these into future reserve editions and mine plans. It is becoming increasingly more challenging and costly for our industry to develop supplies to meet the dramatically increasing demand for copper and our team literally loves where our Freeport is situated in this environment. Slide 11 we have strong operating franchises in the U.S., South America and Indonesia. In all these localities we've earned the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, suppliers, financial markets, and most importantly our workers communities in the countries where we operate. We have significant development large-scale operating expertise development and large-scale operating expertise. We have all the capabilities now to undertake new projects anywhere in the world regardless or the situation in a responsible and efficient manner. I want to close by recognizing the people of Freeport around the globe, their commitment, dedication, remarkable achievements over the past year of COVID is really special. In the context of all the challenges our team has faced over the years and we've overcome I'm just immensely proud of this team. Building on these accomplishments with an increasingly bright future Freeport is charging ahead responsibly, reliably, and relentlessly. Kathleen's going to review the financial results with you. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you Richard and I will just make some brief comments on our financial and operating matters and then we can take your questions. Starting on Slide 14 we provide some additional details on our operating activities. You can see in the U.S. the Lone Star mine is operating well. We see opportunities to continue to increase our stacking rates there and fill up the tank house which has a capacity in the 285 million pound per annum range. With continued success and increasing the mining and stacking rates we will have an opportunity for relatively low incremental investments, increased production from the Lone Star oxides well above the original design. We restarted Chino in the first quarter at a 50% rate and as we gain the efficiencies we are targeting there likely have opportunities to ramp up further. At Morenci we're increasing mining rates by about 10%. This was previously planned for 2022 but we are accelerating this which will give us additional production in 2022 compared with the earlier plan and set us up for growing production over time. In South America the team was able to achieve stronger rates compared with our plan. Because of the operating restrictions in Peru we felt it was prudent to maintain our plan this year at a milling rate of 360,000 tons per day and we expect to ramp that up over the next 12 months to the 400,000 a day level as COVID restrictions are lifted. At El Abra we're making great progress increasing our operating rates to provide additional copper in 2022. As Richard mentioned at Grasberg we made excellent progress in the first quarter continuing to execute the ramp up plan to retreat our targeted metal run rates by the end of the year. We ended the first quarter with more inventory than originally expected and these sales will be recorded in the second quarter. You will note from our detailed schedules and the reference material that we made some small changes in the Grasberg block cave and Deep MLZ mine sequencing. The net effect of these were not material to our metal production and the outlook is similar to the prior plans. We're very encouraged with the scale of the ramp up going on both at Grasberg block cave and Deep MLZ. We will be adding a second crusher at Grasberg block cave this quarter which will set us up to continue to increase rates there. On the next slide we provide an update on our plans to develop new smelter capacity in Indonesia to meet our commitments to the government. We're proceeding with our Japanese partners at PT smelting to expand the existing smelter. This can be done on a relatively low-cost basis and would reduce the required capacity for the new smelter to 1.7 million tons of concentrate per annum. The cost for PT smelting is roughly 250 million and PT-FI would fund these costs through a bank financing which is currently in progress. As you've read we have been engaging in discussions with third party for the balance of the requirement whereby this party would build a new smelter under a structure similar to what we developed for the PT smelting existing smelter in the 1990s. To date the parties have had extensive negotiations but we have not yet reached acceptable commercial terms. In the interim we're continuing our planning on the greenfield project in East Java. As we show on this chart on the right you'll see that the long-term cost, the economics for the financing of the smelter which we would plan to finance with debt would be offset by a phase out of the 5% export duty we're currently paying. So the economic impact for PT-FI is not material. On slide \u2013 on the next slide, Slide 16 where we provide our three-year outlook for copper volumes, gold volumes, and molybdenum volumes. We are increasing our copper sales volumes in 2021 to 3.85 billion pounds from the prior estimate of just over 3.8 billion pounds and we've increased our 2022 guidance by 100 million pounds to 4.4 billion pounds of copper and that's reflective of incremental increases in the U.S. The rest of the sales estimates are largely unchanged. As Richard mentioned we're continuing to assess additional incremental near-term growth opportunities while we conduct our longer range development planning. We provided on Slide 17 an overview of our estimated unit net cash cost for the year. You will note that we have updated our estimate to average 133 per pound of copper in net unit cash costs compared with the prior estimate of 125 per pound. A large portion of this increase is associated with higher royalties, duties and profit sharing related to the change in price assumptions from $3.50 per pound of copper to $4 per pound. We've also increased our cost estimates to reflect higher energy costs principally oil related which our forecast is now higher by about 25%. Our team continues to do a great job in managing cost efficiently. We have seen some increases but they have not been significant. Our team continues to look for creative ways to maintain our low cost position. On Slide 18 we show the significance of cash flow generation using our volume and cost estimates and we provided sensitivities ranging from $4 per pound copper to $5 and we hold gold flat at 17.50 per ounce and molybdenum at $11 per pound. The growth in volumes at low incremental cost results in very significant EBITDA generation. You can see here ranging from over 12.5 billion per annum on average for 2022 and 2023 at $4 copper to 17 billion per annum at $5 copper. Operating cash flows under these price scenarios would range from nearly $9 billion to $12 billion and these cash flows are significantly above our planned capital spending providing substantial free cash flows as we go forward. On Slide 19, we show our capital project forecast and we show projected capital of $2.3 billion in 2021 that includes potential spending on the Indonesian smelter which again would be debt finance but these, the 2021 guidance numbers are very similar to what we had in our previous reports. Our 2022 capital of $2.2 billion on a consolidated basis is about $200 million higher than our previous forecast and that incorporates an acceleration of mining investments to bring volumes forward and provide capacity assurance for our plans. We've entered, we are in a strong financial position an event a period of exceptional free cash flow generation. Slide 20 kind of shows you that the exceptional cash flow generation that we have in the business. You can see on the slide where in a six month period of time our cash balance has increased by over $2 billion. Our long-lived asset base, our growing production profile, strong markets provide the ability to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, provide cash returns to shareholders and build additional values in our asset base. Our financial policy that Richard talked about earlier is designed to tick all of these boxes and we look forward to executing on these plans. And in closing I just say the echo what Richard said it's an exciting time at Freeport. We've got the right assets at the right time and we're staying focused on continuing our momentum and now operator we would like to open a call for questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Emily Chieng : Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. Thanks for the update here today. Just a question around the capital allocation policy and I appreciate that you updated this a couple of months ago. But certainly sounds like there's a significant amount of cash returns potential upcoming if we were to assume current copper prices. But maybe on the other side of that, could you discuss how you're thinking about when the right time to sanction growth would be? And any color you can provide on sort of long-term or sustainable copper prices that you would need to see or need to base case in your assumptions for this? And then you mentioned being disciplined and selective, but as you look over the next couple of years, at what point would you start considering not pulling the trigger on growth? Richard Adkerson : So Emily, we are - we have suspended all of our studies on growth projects a year ago. And now, we've resumed those analysis with the purpose of understanding the pros and cons of each of the projects and developing an evaluation of them. That basic work of evaluation, we expect to continue at least through the end of this year. And by the end of the year, we hope to be able to have a clearer path forward. So it will be some time before there is any commitment to actually initiate significant capital spending. And then in the meantime, we pointed to all the volume growth that's coming about from Grasberg, the resumption of operations from COVID, et cetera. So we're going to have increasing volumes with strong prices and high cash flows with limited amount of capital being spent because we just won't be ready, as you say, to sanction projects. We don't have any particular target at copper price. We've always looked at a scenario of different prices that of how a new project would fit into our portfolio. We want to take advantage of these resources that we have and yet have risk managements by how they fit into all of our existing portfolios. So we don't look at it so much on an individual project by project basis, but how does it fit in with our projects. Freeport really benefits from the fact that we operate all the projects we have interest in. So that allows us to approach these on a \u2013 from a consistent corporate strategic basis as opposed to an individual project by project basis. Certainly, at these price levels, our projects are economic. And now you know the prospects are for prices to go much higher. So I anticipate that over time, we will be spending money on capital. That's just not going to happen in the near-term and that's going to be a feature of the entire industry because even when we decide to spend the timeframe for developing a project is multiple years, minimum six to eight years. So all of that's going to be, as you well know, Emily, because you write about it all the time, that's going to be very supportive of copper prices. You can't turn on the valve quickly to add new mine supply. And when you can't do that and volume and demand rises that translates into higher prices. Emily Chieng : Got it. That's very helpful color. And one quick one if I could squeeze it in. just an operational update at the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ. Looks like sales volumes maybe moved out a quarter a little bit. But anything you can provide on sort of the sustainability of the copper grades we're are seeing, any ramp profile comments that can pace the drilling, belling there, please? Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : We got Mark Johnson on. Mark, you want to just give an update on. Mark Johnson : Yes, we're generally on plan. Grades are tracking well from the model to what we see at the mill. In fact, we're fortunate that the mills actually seen a little bit more grades and the mine has recorded as pending. Drawbell opening, it's probably shown in the slides that we did make some adjustments in Deep MLZ. We slowed down the cave advance in some of our diorite rock types, which are the more challenging rock and accelerate the cave advance and some of the scarring going off to the west in PB2. In GBC, we've added \u2013 accelerated our drawbell opening. And over the five years, it's relatively the same. Emily Chieng : Great. That's helpful. Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Yes. And the fact we referenced delay in shipments that had nothing to do with operations. The inventory was there on site. There were loading, shipping some administrative issues with the government, and so all that inventory was produced on site now will be sold. And as inventory built, we were able to advance some maintenance activities from the second quarter to the first quarter, all of which is really supportive of meeting our plans going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Chris LaFemina : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Richard Adkerson : Good morning. Chris LaFemina : Just questions about this, Richard, how are you? The question is about the performance in South America. It was good to see that you appear to be operating well there despite the escalation of COVID, but we have some political risk that is potentially escalating there as well, especially in Peru with the upcoming presidential run-off. So the first question is related to the contracts and licenses that you have in Peru. Is it similar to what you had in Indonesia, where you have a stability agreement with international arbitration provisions should something go wrong in terms of government trying to significantly increase taxes or try to nationalize the mine? Is that you have the same sort of protection there? Richard Adkerson : Yes, we \u2013 yes, the answer to that is an absolute yes. And we - stability agreements has been a feature of the operations in Cerro Verde since way before Freeport. But we were able to get a new stability agreement as we expanded the business. And you know, there is always a correlation between the aspirations of government and workers for more funds as copper prices rise. But the copper is so critical to Peru in terms of a country that still faces challenges of poverty and so forth. So we just step back and watch political environments. We know we have to work with whatever governments wherever in the world that a country selects, but we do have strong rights to do that. And unlike some operations in Peru, we have positive relationships with the local community because of social investments we've made in water and wastewater projects. So our team there is just, I mean, I can't tell you what a great job they go. A year ago, we were really worried about Peru. Our workers lived in the city of Arequipa. It was real issue with community spread, but we've been put to work the community, developed temporary living and we got our rates up to near our original run rate targets and we can expand further as we go forward. The team there has just done a remarkably good job... Chris LaFemina : So very good to hear. Thank you for that. And then\u2026 Kathleen Quirk : In terms of stability agreement, we do our taxes are fixed in that agreement, and they are actually higher than the current statutory rate in Peru. So we've paid harder to get the stability and we also pay a lot with the communities and big employer. We have a profit sharing mechanism there. And that's partly why you saw the cost increases that we do is the mine becomes more profitable with higher prices. There's a large profit share and that goes to employees, partially to employees and partially to the country. So it's a good model to share economics both to the local communities and country and workers and to the investors. Chris LaFemina : Great. Thanks and with respect to potential expansion at a El Abra we're hearing from other Chilean miners about challenges getting permits. It seems like in some cases, permitting is nearly impossible, which I suppose for the copper market is pretty bullish if companies can bring capacity online in Chile, but I'm just wondering, in terms of El Abra what sort of permitting hurdles you might have to actually spend that asset. Thank you? Kathleen Quirk : We will have an environmental impact statement that will file in connection with the project. So that is a very comprehensive permitting process. We've gone through it before and you have to do a lot of baseline work, etc. So there is a lot of work you have to do before you actually submit it. But that project partially is, the permitting is partially why Richard saying it's six to eight years out. Chris LaFemina : Okay. Thanks. Richard Adkerson : And the best environment, Chris, it's going to take a long time to get that permit. Now, we don't have some of the costs of where this mines located. And the fact that it's been a long running existing operation is near Codelco mine. It doesn't have some of the permitting issues that others have. A major mill expansion would require a desalinization plant and the cost of transmitting that water up to high altitude where we operate but it's in a setting where we don't face some of the challenges others face. But best case it takes a long time and it's a big project. Chris LaFemina : Great, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Richard Adkerson : Good morning Alex. Alex Hacking : Hey Richard, how are you? Good morning. Just following up on Chris's question on Peru. I'm not sure how much you can answer here but has there been any engagement yet between the mining industry and the candidates particularly the candidate that's leading in the polls? And then secondly, regarding your production footprint with Chino back and Cerro Verde heading back to full rates, does that put Freeport's production footprint back at normalize pre-COVID levels or is there a potential future upside at these prices? Thanks. Kathleen Quirk : I'll take the second one first. Just in terms of the ramp back up we've made the decision to start ramping El Abra back up. That's in progress. We expect to get back to pre-COVID levels there in 2022. That's reflected in our guidance. Same with Cerro Verde. In the U.S. we had cut back the mining rates significantly. We're starting to ramp those back up. We have some opportunities, still have some opportunities at the Morenci that aren't baked into our forecast yet. And then we have opportunities at Chino, because our plan right now is running at Chino 50%. In addition to that, as we mentioned we have some incremental opportunities potentially at Lone Star. So I would say in the U.S. we do have some opportunities that aren't in our near term plans. That will be -- we'll be assessing as well as some of the leach technology applications that Richard referred to earlier. So we do have some near term opportunities not in our plans but a \u2013 Richard Adkerson : Hey Kathleen let's let Josh make a brief comment about that. Josh Olmstead was named this past year to be our Chief Operating Officer, Americas. He's been number two guy for many years. He's a young guy but he's got a long career in Freeport is just doing an outstanding job and bringing energy and leadership to our group. So Josh make a couple of comments. Josh Olmsted : Thanks Richard. As Kathleen was stating we have some near-term opportunities with Morenci, Lone Star incremental things. The most exciting piece I think is the work that we're doing on the leach technology that both Richard and Kathleen touched on. If we can prove out some of the concepts that we've identified and began working on it could have a significant impact on our ability to take advantage of long-term stockpiles that we have out there that contain copper today that we haven't been able to extract and so this leach technology really could be meaningful as we look for opportunities to get some incremental, low-cost incremental copper as we move forward and so our plans are working on that this year with the goal of having very similar to Richard's comments about the bigger scale projects having much more clarity by the end of the year on what that looks like and what the potential value is for us but we're super excited about what we're seeing so far. Richard Adkerson : So restarts technology reaching all those point to growing volumes from our traditional operations Chris. Alex right we're at Alex now. so Alex on Peru man how complicated politics everywhere in the world and in Peru as they were approaching this runoff you had a half dozen more candidates each having 10% plus or minus support in the polls. So it was very complicated. Freeport stays out of politics. As I said we don't, we just run our business, support communities, be prepared to work with whoever emerges in the political process. The mining industry in Peru is there is an active mining association that's led by Peruvians and they engage with candidates to understand and interact and communicate with them on policies affecting mining and I'm sure they'll be working with both of these candidates as we go forward and you will notice the candidate who earlier was being very aggressive and talking about mining is now making comments about the importance of mining to Peru. So all of that will come to play and we'll just have to see what happens. Alex Hacking : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Bank of America. Timna Tannersa : Hey good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you a little bit, hey there, I want to ask a little bit more about costs. Obviously you went through in nice detail about what caused the incremental cost in the quarter and in the guidance but obviously costs are rising inflation is a big topic I mean do you think that this encapsulates the future costs that you could bear fully or are you seeing further pressure and can you detail where that could come from and a little bit of what you've been seeing in more detail? Richard Adkerson : So the first point I want to make is a point Kathleen referenced earlier. Some important elements are of our cost are correlated to copper prices. They're correlated I mean things like royalties, profit sharing plans, labor cost in general there is correlation. Then there is other input costs that are correlated. Energy costs which is an important element our cost and with energy costs have risen in recent months. Copper prices have risen even more thankfully but energy costs are are built into that and then certain other costs are seeing some inflation. So far energy costs are the ones that outside of the profit sharing loyalty costs are the ones that have the biggest impact and as time goes by and copper prices rise we'll have to deal with inflation but we have such strong margins, we have a great supply group team that works with our suppliers to offset costs wherever we can. We're working really aggressively to do that. So Tim I think I mean I know you realize this because you're right about it but inflation is good for copper. I mean inflation is good for copper with what the world's doing today with all this spending on COVID recovery with spending around the world that's being driven to the deal with economic inequalities. That's pushing money to people who consume and create economic velocity which creates demand for copper. So in the broader sense all these forces will work to the benefit of our company. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. What's been interesting is you look at today four and a quarter copper last time copper was four and a quarter, oil wasn't at 60. It might have been [$110] a barrel. So we are benefiting from the lower energy prices even though they have come up some the historical correlations just aren't, as correlated as they once were. And we go through a review each quarter on where we are with our supply chain and revise our forecasts every quarter to reflect current pricing and that sort of thing. So that's baked into these plans. And as Richard said whether we'll have additional cost pressures from tightening freight markets or other supplies we'll have to see where that goes. But right now the forecast that we developed is based on what our pricing contracts are currently. Timna Tanners : The high quality problem, but if we're assuming a bit higher copper price for example, we should also be incorporated sounds like some assumption of inflation as well? Richard Adkerson : Well as I said, the answer is yes. There's correlations, I mean, royalties rise, profit sharing rise and then you make your judgment about energy, steel costs and so forth. But and I know a broken record Tim, that I know you understand. But bottom line is margin rise. For many businesses these inflationary movements deteriorate margins. Historically our margins have stayed very strong as copper prices rise and other costs rise. Timna Tanners : Now, for sure, that's clear. Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Murphy with Barclays. Matthew Murphy : Hi. I have a question on the Indonesia smelter and wondering if you can help me understand the risks around the pace of the project. So there was the disclosure in your 10-K about the sign and there is been some comments in the press and just wondering what you're expecting? Is it possible through this discussion and looking at the options that you could see more fines or you could see more frustration from Indonesian government or do you think it's going the other way, and it'll get resolved. Richard Adkerson : I'm going to let Kathleen talk about this. She is working actively with the parties there and negotiating the terms. We are going to cooperate with the government. We made a commitment in December 18 to build a smelter and I'm very clear that we recognize that commitment and we are prepared to honor it. There are different views within the government of Indonesia. When you reference the government it can be interpreted as being one group. There are different views within the government itself about whether it's despite this development [indiscernible] or go forward with the project at Gresik that we initially started and so we are working closely with our partner and shareholder mine [indiscernible] and with the Ministry of state owned enterprises, with the Ministry of Energy and Mines defined what is best, what decision the government off we made and we're prepared to go forward provided we have if we go in the direction that where we have reasonable terms and reasonable regulatory environment. So Kathleen why don't you talk about this and mine ministry wants to push us I believe we will resolve this situation and that everything's going to be okay. Kathleen would you give some detail. Kathleen Quirk : Okay. Under the regulations the government grants annual export licenses and then there is a six month check to evaluate your progress against the smelter development schedule that they have and they have approved. As a result of COVID as we said during 2020 we notified the government that our schedule was impacted by the pandemic and they will force majeure conditions that prevented us from you from achieving schedule. And under regulations, there is a potential for fines if you don't achieve the schedule. And that's what the government did. They levied this fine and we have gone in and explained to them the reasons why the project was delayed and that this was force majeure, which is allowed under the regulations to waive any penalty. So we're in those discussions with the government. They're asking for some additional support for opposition and details. I mean it's obvious that COVID effected schedules for projects all around the world but they're asking for some more details. We think it will get resolved in a mutually satisfactory way. But as Richard said we're also very focused on meeting our commitment to the government ultimately. We notified them that we had a 12 month away in reaching the, because of COVID reaching a deadline of December of 23 to construct the new smelter, and now we expect that that wouldn't be completed until 2024. This option that Richards referring to [indiscernible] potentially could get us back on schedule. And we just need to make sure that it fits with from a commercial standpoint and overall business risk standpoint. But we're working closely with the government. I can say that our interests, having our partner in [indiscernible] our interests are very much aligned and we're all on the same page in terms of what we need to do and we're just working our way through the government's regulations to resolve this issue. And I'm confident we will. Matthew Murphy : Thanks Kathleen. So the outcome of the discussion with the government would that be the completion of sort of a new smelter progress schedule? Kathleen Quirk : Yes. You're right. That's part of what we're discussing as a new schedule for the project and that's tied in with our discussions with them on this administrative fine. Matthew Murphy : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carlos de Alba with Morgan Stanley. Carlos de Alba : Good morning Richard and Kathleen good morning. Just following up on this smelter would you please expand a little bit more on the status of the negotiation within commercial parties maybe for a third party to do the investment in the major smelter? Are those still ongoing or have they stopped and we should now come back and think more about PT-FI doing this method on its own? And then on CapEx and it's not a big increase CapEx outlook for 2022 increase about 220 million related to other projects. Is there anything in concrete that you highlight or it's just based on the series of projects that that you elaborated on earlier in the call? Kathleen Quirk : Yes. Well on the -- Carlos de Alba : Let me say the last question. It's good news Carlos. Higher copper prices gives you an incentive to spend money to increase values and so these are items that were largely in our long term plans that we're advancing to create value right Kathleen. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. That's exactly right. We brought forward some capital. We've also increased production. So that's what that was is basically mining equipment investments. The first part of it in terms of the negotiations and we don't publicly comment on details of the negotiations while they're still in progress. But we had all set a target of trying to get the commercial agreement with a third party done by the end of March and so there were extensive negotiations that went back and forth during the first quarter. By the end of March we had not reached an acceptable agreement and we've been moving in parallel this other projects. At some point we've got to make a decision. We haven't finalized that decision yet but we are moving the greenfield our own project forward so that we can meet our obligations to the governments and not rely solely on a third party. So at this point we are still having some discussions with the third party but we're moving the other one in parallel as well. So as soon as we get a final decision and believe me we all want that as soon as possible we will convey that to you. Carlos de Alba : That's clear and I appreciate the caller. Thank you very much Richard and Kathleen. Speaker: Yes Carlos it's and when we talk there we say I was listening to Kathleen some of the weirdest decisions by the government. The we in Indonesia is the PT-FI which is a partnership between mine [indiscernible] and FCX. FCX operates but we in Indonesia is that partnership along with the ministry of state-owned enterprises. It's a different world from those of you who followed us for all the years we were dealing with the government when FCX had to take the lead and really me personally was there on the ground on these negotiations. Now we're there very much as a team as Kathleen says it's aligned and it's a much better environment than we had historically. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Orest Wowkodaw : Hi good morning. Just again a follow-up on the smelter. At some point I assume you're going to have to make a decision in terms of whether to build your own or whether to go with a third party. Is there at this point is there a drop dead date in terms of which direction that goes? I mean certainly you can't drag this on forever? Richard Adkerson : No it's a government. I mean it's really, the government's going to make that decision. We're prepared if we could get, if the government supports it and we could get a reasonable deal with constraint sale terms and a regulatory environment dealing with our IUPK obligations, PT-FI is prepared to deal with we debate. If that doesn't happen we're prepared to go forward with the other project and we're working on that. We're not sitting here not doing anything. We're prepared to go forward and I just think it's important to keep in mind that while this is a big project and it's a management issue it's not a huge financial issues FCX. I mean we were paying a 5% export duty that would be relieved with the smelter. The financial implications are not that significant and more than 70% of the financial implications go to the government through taxes and equity share ownership. So -- Kathleen Quirk : But Orest we do want to make a decision sooner. There is not some kind of drop dead date but we want to make this decision very soon. Orest Wowkodaw : Yes. Okay. Thank you. And just I was going to say it's a follow-up. Go ahead Richard. Richard Adkerson : No I'm just saying it's not like we can say we're going to do this, we're going to, it's got to be a joint decision between the government and PT-FI. Orest Wowkodaw : I see, okay. Is it fair to assume I mean given that benchmark or spot TC for copper are so depressed right now that in order for a third party to agree to build the smelter that it is affair to assume that they'd be looking for some kind of stability in the TCs perhaps that are at higher levels? Kathleen Quirk : Yes. Richard Adkerson : Yes. Orest Wowkodaw : Okay. Richard Adkerson : Yes. Orest Wowkodaw : Okay and just a point of clarification did I hear earlier you state that you hope to be in a position to provide the market with some guidance on some of the brownfield growth opportunities in the U.S. by the end of the year? Was that correct? Richard Adkerson : That's our hope. That's our aspiration. I mean as you know we're very transparent company and our hope is that we get some clarity by the end of the year. Josh mentioned it. Kathleen mentioned it and as we do we're going to keep all of you informed. Orest Wowkodaw : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question caption the line of John Tumazos, Very Independent Research. Richard Adkerson : Hey John. John Tumazos : Thank you very much. Good morning. Thank you for taking my call and congrats on all the money that's raining on you. Just following up on Emily's first question for the Baghdad mill project and the El Abra mill project and the Kucing Liar underground project which we know you're going to meticulously engineer and study as you plan and permit and build and finance. Is it safe to say each of those are likely to come on 2025 or later? Richard Adkerson : Yes. John Tumazos : Is it -- Kathleen Quirk : Yes. [Baghdad] could come on quicker than the other two. The long lead times for investments for KL and Kucing Liar we are that's in our long-term plans. We're just optimizing it now so that in that capital will be spent over a long period of time and then El Abra just from a sequencing standpoint would come behind Baghdad from time period that it could come online. So you're talking about if you started everything right now you're talking about seven years out with all the permitting process seven- eight years maybe all the permitting process but Baghdad could be done probably on your 2025 type timeline if we depend on when we start. John Tumazos : If I could ask one more I recall Kucing Liar results that were very good in the 90s how recently has that been drilled and updated. So you have access and you've updated those studies and have more information. Richard Adkerson : Yes. We have also John you'll probably remember that Kucing Liar has pyrite content and so Mark talk about how we've been working and this has been a continual work project. it is independent of Grasberg black cave Deep MLZ and our other operations but Mark maybe comment on how we've updated our analysis of KL? Mark Johnson : Yes. I mean in the last three years or so it was a significant change wasn't so much new drilling. We did do some drilling over the last couple years and we revisited some of the metallurgical work. The big change there was and as Richard alluded to the original KL mine plan was more focused on higher copper equivalent grade but it also had much higher pyrite and required a significant change to our processing. The new mine plan focuses on some slightly lower copper equivalent portion of the resource that has now become the reserve and we've, and this part of the ore body essentially we leave the mill as it is the pyrite problem is largely diminished and almost eliminated. So the overall capital as far as processing, power requirements, environmental management have dropped significantly in addition this new portion of the new mine plan the areas that we mined the gold recoveries go up substantially. We in our initial reserves several years ago gold recoveries were below 50% the new plan has gold recoveries over 60 and we think there's upside there. So it's a much less capital intensive, a much more robust plan, a lot less environmental management costs that go with this new KL plan. The one thing as Richard mentioned that it's independent but in some ways it does tie in. We share parts of the GBC ore flow system. KL ramps up and in coordination with the GBC plan we used some of the same conveyor and then the big part was is that the mill is relatively unchanged with this new plan. Richard Adkerson : Thanks Mark. Mark Johnson : And so John, yes thanks Mark. So John this is not a competing project to our Americas growth plan. I mean it's in our long-term plan as Kathleen said. It fits in with everything we're doing out there and then the trade-offs of where we invest in the Americas is one where we will be looking at the pros and cons of each project. in the U.S. we have no royalties because we own the land and fee we have no taxes because of our tax loss carry forward for a very long period of time and tax rates in the U.S. are very low. So I mean, all of this this is an after tax, after royalty economic analysis, and we're going to decide where can we add value most economically for our shareholders. John Tumazos : I was just so happy to see it raining money and good opportunities on you. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks John. John Tumazos : Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Long winding road but it's great. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with VRP. Richard Adkerson : Yes, good morning. Michael Dudas : Good morning, Richard and Kathy. I need to follow up on your thoughts on investment for Freeport. Certainly looking at after tax returns, copper price, etc. taxes how much more will ESG be involved in some of the analysis that not only you but the industry is going to have to work on to get, you thinking of adding significant hurdles generally, some obviously, you have to have a social license to operate by and we understand that. But is it because of the more important that's going to be helpful is that going to add hurdles to some of this long term investment that the industry is going to require to meet the demand needs going forward? Richard Adkerson : It's not only go it is today I mean it is today. And I mean, ESG matters are not something that's common across all projects. They're all site specific related. I made a point, I think you probably picked up on it and talking about our growth projects in Arizona being supported by communities and by native American groups. That's because we've been there for so long and we have devoted attention and resources to those communities and to providing opportunities beyond just our separate operations. Elsewhere in Arizona even which has a favorable state view for mining development there are huge barriers from an ESG standpoint to developments and you just look at Rosemont and resolution and other projects. So you have to go and look at each particular project each the way companies have provided but it's an enormous barrier and it's going to grow. I mean the number of groups that are involved in ESG attention you see it with institutional investors [indiscernible] were with but consumer groups are very focused. Automobile manufacturers are focused about where their minerals coming from, where's their copper coming from. That's why this copper mark thing that I referenced is so important. So it's going to be, it's an enormous issue right now and it's going to be a major impact on, it's going to be supply development. So -- Kathleen Quirk : Yes. And it's always been part of our project evaluation. It's even more so today but it's always been part of our evaluation is using less energy, diversifying our energy sources to looking at renewables. Water is a big issue that we manage. We found a great solution in Cerro Verde in Peru when we did that project where we built a wastewater treatment plant to get water. So we didn't compete with other uses of water in the country and actually helped the community. So we're always looking as part of our projects, how does this project help the community and ESG has always been part of it as Richard said it's just growing much larger. And I guess this, but copper is really a great story. We don't have the scope three emissions that other companies have to deal with. Copper is actually, what copper is used for is actually used for decarbonisation but the scope one and two areas is something that we work hard on every day and it's all part of our project development plans and capital investment plans. Michael Dudas : Yes. Appreciate those thoughtful answers. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andreas Bokkenheuser with UBS. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Thank you very much. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick operational question a two part one actually. Obviously we saw production a bit higher in Q1 versus sales. Can you just comment a little bit further about the restocking? I think you were saying also that there might be some gold sales at Glasberg that are going to get delayed into sales Q2. So what kind of drove that? Richard Adkerson : Okay. So let me address that we don't sell copper and gold in Grasberg. We sell copper concentrate. It's got copper and gold in it. We get paid for the the individual components at LME prices but as I mentioned earlier what happened at Grasberg is we met our production targets, we transported this copper concentrate to the port site to be ready to ship, some shipments got delayed for various reasons and so the production's done and we recognize sales when the concentrate's loaded on ships. So literally all we have is some of those sales are going to be in the second quarter [indiscernible] first quarter and it's just that simple and throughout our operations we have timing issues like that. For those of you who follow the Grasberg we have weather conditions at port. It's a shallow water sea and so weather conditions can delay shipments but all this will ends up being strictly a timing whether it's at the last of the first quarter or the early part of the second quarter it's irrelevant. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Okay. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. Generally our production equals our sales and we did have some both in the U.S. and in Indonesia we did have some changes between production and sales but that's like Richard said just timing. Richard Adkerson : As you can imagine we can sell everything we produce. That's not an issue. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Absolutely. That's very clear and a follow-up question you've obviously been mentioning that you expect the output of the Peru, and sort of early to kind of return to normal next year are there any other mines in your global portfolios that are right now kind of feeling the pressure of any COVID restrictions or anything of that nature where you expect there could be a bit of a volume ramp up going into uh next year? Richard Adkerson : Well, we mentioned we should we restart we'd actually suspended operations at the Chino mine in New Mexico relatively small mine but we resuming operations there. We reduced mine rate stripping rates at Morenci to conserve cost and that'll take some time to restore and production will build up from there but it's nothing of real significance. The amazing thing is the guys Mark and his team at Grasberg have just done remarkable with meeting our targets there in the face of a very challenging COVID location and we've done remarkable job in managing all that and continue to. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. I'd say logistically in South America is where we have the biggest constraints currently but we're still dealing with it all over in terms of protocols, etc. So we're not letting up the guard and we're continuing to be very careful about how we operate make sure people are safe but in terms of the logistical side of things it's mainly impacted South America. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Okay. Richard Adkerson : Sorry. Internal medical director. We work with international SOS for years and they've been fabulous in helping us build testing facilities and facilities for dealing with infected people. We're able to treat them get them back to work and that's an ongoing process. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Okay. That's clear. So for South America the expected plan is the ramp up happens in the second half and then you're kind of back at full run rate in early 2022. Is that the right way of thinking about it? Kathleen Quirk : Well, in fact and Peru specifically our plan is to run at this reduced rate all year long and we'll assess that as we go but right now the going in assumption is that we'll be in the situation for the balance of 2021 and then go back to the plan in 2022. That's the assumption. In Chile it's a smaller operation but we are beginning to increase our mining and stacking rates there and the metal impact will happen in 2022 but we're starting that now. so but our plan at Cerro Verde which is our largest operation in South America is to be at this low, slightly lower rate in the balance of the year. The team did a great job and was able to surpass expectations in the first quarter but it's not something that we feel is prudent to assume because the restrictions are still very significant. Andreas Bokkenheuser : Okay. That's very clear. Thank you very much. Richard Adkerson : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities. Lucas Pipes : Morning Richard. Kathleen thanks very much for taking my question as well. Most of my questions have been asked and answered but I wanted to circle back Richard to some of the earlier comments you made regarding this being one of the best copper markets outlooks you've seen and in light of that when we think about the framework for retaining capital versus returning capital to what extent could this be subject to review? We spend a lot of time on this call talking about organic growth for example. so could there be an incentive to toggle this ratio more towards the growth side and then along the same vein M&A -- have your views on that evolved and if so what geography could make sense? Could you be looking at producing miners or would you look pre-production would appreciate any updated thought from that as well. Thank you very much. Richard Adkerson : That's a very good multi-layered question. Let me see if I can answer it precisely. I've been around a long time and I see there's three kind of eras of copper demand. Pre-early 2000s it was all driven by develop countries GDP. Copper's most correlated commodity to GDP and it would rise and fall based on business cycles. China emerged and now for almost two decades has dominated new demand growth. It's all come from China when you look at it. The rest of the world's kind of been flat. The new era today which is so exciting is China's rate of growth which people have been pointing to for some time inevitably is falling has to fall. COVID kind of complicated all that up but its absolute demand for copper volumes is so strong because this economy has grown and that's going to continue with even as it pivots its economy to consumers and exports it's the absolute amount of copper that it grows even though the rate of growth will drop absolute amount be strong. Now the reason I'm so excited about now is now you've got it's COVID recovered in the developed world but also all this movement around the world you see it clearly here in the United States to push money to a broader set of people to enhance consumption. All this move towards incoming inequality which everybody recognized we got to do and that's going to create new copper demand and then my long-term story's always been in the undeveloped world, global growth all the vast numbers of people around the world that are living in substandard conditions have aspirations of having better conditions that requires more energy, more transportation, communication, more copper. So that's why I say the demand side to me is in a new era and it's really positive and the supply side I don't know how it's going to keep up with it. I literally don't. Here we have all of these projects at Freeport the price of copper could double overnight. Some people talk about it doubling anyway but overnight and we couldn't add new production of significance for a number of years. So it's going to be really interesting to see prices I just unless there's some global calamity prices it just seems to me clearly have to rise substantially. Substitution has to occur. Scrap has to grow but how to meet that demand and that's why I'm so thrilled about where we are after all this time working to put this company together. John Tamazo's referenced it I mean we have been through so much but I recall Kathleen and I developed a strategy in 2003-2004 when I became CEO of focusing on copper and now it's so great here all these years later to see it coming to fruition. Lucas Pipes : Very helpful so. Kathleen Quirk : And in terms of the M&A question we're really focused on our existing assets. We've got development options within the portfolio. We always monitor what's available externally and compare that against what we have. Richard Adkerson : Let me add just a personal observation on that. Our company made a mistake, misstep other mining companies made missteps when they forced M&A for strategic reasons. You just look over and over again. South side came to us as an opportunity. It wasn't a strategic plan to do it. We had talked with them about buying us. So where we are now is we have no strategy of engaging in M&A markets but we will be positioned now for the first time in a long-long time to -- if an opportunity come to us comes to us to take advantage of us. Our strategy is straightforward; execute, invest in a disciplined way in our resources that provide growth, that create value. If something comes to us we're going to be in a position to consider it but that's not our strategic objective. You mentioned startup operations and those come to us all the time but we have trouble. It's been a big barrier to make the economics of those work because to get into it you've got to pay the value that's been created already. When we have all these other resources in our portfolio where there is no value being given to them in our share price. So we see that's been a real barrier of making even what might be at some level interesting projects work economically for our company and we've had a long saying in Freeport big minds get bigger and smaller minds get smaller. So that's also a tough issue. Lucas Pipes : Richard, Kathleen thank you very much for the color and continued best of luck. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jatinder Goel with Exane BNP Paribas. Jatinder Goel : Good morning and good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Just one on smelter. To get a bit more clarity is it only one party that you are engaging with on potentially outsourcing the smelter or are there multi-parties? The reason for asking you might have seen a news release or a media article last week that Indonesia has signed MoU with ENFI and that's in West Papua where people were said to have committed to 800,000 tons of raw material as well which doesn't seem to align with the full scale of smelters. So not sure if you're looking at just one smelter one party or are there multiple elements to it. Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. The discussions today has been most extensive with the project at [indiscernible] The project that you're referring to is in Papua potential project and we are familiar with the developer there and have indicated that if there is excess capacity we may be able to supply but our options right now are focused on the base supply, are focused on either this [indiscernible] option or our project at Gresik. Richard Adkerson : In response to your comment we've made no commitment for supply on the Papua project. For years we would have liked to have seen a smelter developed in Papua because we, it would be desirable to help the local community there but the infrastructure cost, the absence of infrastructure, the timing investment that would be required for infrastructure have made it impracticable in the past. Jatinder Goel : That's very clear. Thank you so much. Operator : Our final question will occur from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James. Brian MacArthur : Good morning. Hi how are you today? Richard Adkerson : Hi Brian. Brian MacArthur : I'd like to go back and talk a little bit about KL because finally after years it's getting closer but it does sound like the project as per John's comment has changed. So I just want to try and understand a little bit because when you look at the grade of this it's point the reserve grades whatever 0.9 copper and 0.9 grams per tonne gold. So it's a little more gold than some of the others. So in this new plan I guess my first question is you talked about certain areas of the ore body. Is there an area that's higher grade which you start which helps the economics and my second question it sounds like the new plan obviously saves CapEx which is good, technically probably is easier which is good but then you talk about lower copper equivalency. So I'm trying to figure out just how much lower that copper equivalency is and secondary that obviously that depends on price assumptions too. So I'm trying to [indiscernible] pretty good. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. We will let Mark talk about it but there is a section of the mine that and we did the same thing with the Glasberg block cave development. We modified it over time to focus on the lowest pyrite sections and what Mark will tell you is that with KL we redesigned the mine plan to reduce the capital intensity because in order to get the pyrite there is more capital in the mill, more environmental management required and the recovery starts going down. You mentioned the 0.9 but it has a very low recovery in some of the ore. So what we have developed here is a more optimal plan that reduces upfront CapEx and modestly changes the total ore but from a metal standpoint you're actually ending up with similar metal because you've got higher recoveries. So Mark you want to add \u2013 Richard Adkerson : Just we will turn to Mark but it's not that complicated. It's we've designed a new mine plan to avoid and minimize the pyrite section. So and by doing that we reduced mill investments plus there was going to have to be a pipeline you've been out there you -- a pipeline from the mill down the lowlands of storage for pyrite and low and so Mark it's more of a engineering design determination which gets all these economic benefits than anything else. Mark? Mark Johnson : Yes. And I think the major advance was understanding where the not necessarily the highest grade but where the highest value after capital investment was in the ore body and if not for having a debt our contract with the government goes up to 2041 if not for that the material that we've deferred would also be in reserves. So what we've done in this new plan is brought forward. There is about half of the old reserve that overlaps with the old reserve and then there's another half where we've deferred a part of the lower value ore and been able to substitute it with higher value ore. This ore that we're now mining would be sediment hosted very similar to what we've milled for years in the DOZ, Deep MLZ, the old reserve was very much centered on this fault that the highest grades but as Richard and Kathleen mentioned some of the bigger challenges were a new mill, we had to grind it much finer. That came with additional power requirements and then we had to manage the pyrite which for us is to segregate it from the [MOD ADA] and store it separately. So by recognizing all the costs that are associated with some of the higher copper equivalent grade that's a combination of the copper and gold value and substitute it with looking more on a value rather than purely on copper equivalency, we came up with a much more optimal sequencing of the mine with the opportunity to go after this other material at a later date if we had the opportunity to mine beyond 2041. Kathleen Quirk : And it's more reduced risk, more robust plan and we're doing some things right now to continue to try to enhance those gold recoveries. Brian MacArthur : And can you with this new plan and I forget what the original rate you figured KL was going to go through it can you actually offset the higher mining rate because I think you still have mill capacity at 240,000 tons too right? Does that offset it in or is it still sort of the same rate there? Mark Johnson : It's very similar mining rates that we had before the tonnage is similar. It's a little bit less because we start a little bit later but this does fill the 240,000 tons of mill capacity that we'll have with the SAG-3 and so there is a obviously a district-wide plan that we sequence all of the ore bodies to best fill that mill in an optimal fashion. This would peak at 90,000 tons a day just marginally above what we're planning to do with the Deep MLZ and it ramps up as GBC would start to drop off and so it's a balancing of the highest value material getting the first opportunity for mill space. Brian MacArthur : Great. Thank you very much. That's very helpful and it certainly sounds like it's a much more profit risk adjusted capital intensity project than maybe it was thought of 15 years ago when we first looked at this I guess. Richard Adkerson : Yes, that's correct. Exactly right. Brian MacArthur : Thank you very much. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks Brian. Operator : Now I'll turn the call over to management for any closing remarks. Richard Adkerson : 240,000 tons a day from the underground operation. I'll just leave it with that. Thank you so much for being on our call and we look forward to continuing to report our progress as we go forward in this year and following years. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan second quarter conference call. FCX released results earlier this morning, and a copy of today\u2019s press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today\u2019s call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I\u2019d like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. On the call with me today Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Johnson, our Chief Operating Officer for Indonesia; Josh Olmsted, our Chief Operating Officer for the Americas; Mike Kendrick, who leads our molybdenum business; Rick Coleman, who leads our construction and growth projects; and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. I\u2019ll start by briefly summarizing our financial results, and then we\u2019ll turn the call over to Richard who\u2019ll review our outlook and the slide presentation materials that have been provided to you. As usual after our remarks we\u2019ll open up the call for questions. Today, FCX reported second quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stock of $1.08 billion, or $0.73 per share. That included net charges totaling $56 million or $0.04 per share, detailed on page Roman numeral seven of our press release. Adjusted net income attributable to common stock totaled $1.14 billion or $0.77 per share. Our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2021 totaled $2.7 billion. And you can find a reconciliation of our EBITDA calculations on Page 35 of our slide deck materials. We had a strong second quarter, our copper sales of 929 million pounds, and gold sales of 305,000 ounces were significantly above the year ago quarter. But our sales were approximately 5% lower for copper and 8% lower for gold relative to our recent estimates, primarily reflecting the timing of shipments from Indonesia. Our annual guidance is consistent with our prior estimates. Our results in the second quarter benefited from strong pricing. Our second quarter average realized copper price of $4.34 a pound was 70% higher than a year ago quarterly average. Our net unit cash costs of $1.48 per pound of copper on average in the second quarter, with slightly above our estimate going into the quarter of $1.42 per pound, but that primarily related to nonrecurring charges associated with a new four-year labor agreement at Cerro Verde. Operating cash flow generation was extremely strong, totaling $2.4 billion during the quarter. That included $0.5 billion of working capital sources. And our operating cash flows significantly exceeded our capital expenditures of $433 million during the quarter. Our consolidated debt totaled $9.7 billion at the end of June, and our consolidated cash and cash equivalents totaled $6.3 billion at the end of June. Net debt was $3.4 billion at the end of the quarter and we achieved our targeted net debt level several months ahead of our schedule. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Richard and we\u2019ll be reviewing the slide materials that have been provided. Go ahead, Richard. Richard Adkerson : Thank you, Kathleen. Thanks, everybody for joining us. We are really pleased to reporting what\u2019s now becoming a string of really strong operating performances for our company. And with this great positive outlook for our business, we\u2019re all really enthusiastic about it. Hoping all of you are staying healthy through this pandemic. Vaccinations are giving us an opportunity to protect ourselves and those around us and we\u2019re working hard to encourage our people globally to take full advantage of this opportunity whenever possible. Our teams are working safely. We remained diligent with our COVID protocols that have been so effective. With the recent rise in cases globally we are refocusing, redoubling our efforts, restoring some protocols that we had listed \u2013 we had loosened to keep our team and community safe. Our results in the second quarter demonstrate really strong execution of our plans, really strong and favorable pricing for our products. Kathleen mentioned the shipping issue, logistics is an issue globally, if we\u2019ve been able to \u2013 we basically met or slightly exceeded our production targets. We\u2019ve been able to ship everything we produced. We would have beat our sales targets. We also common the mining industry had some one-off type issues affecting production. Without those and with shipping, we would have had a real strong beat on our previous guidance. Really important our Grasberg underground ramp-up is proceeding on schedule. This is a remarkable, and I would say a historic success for both our company and even the mining industry. Our team in Indonesia is doing remarkable and outstanding work and this is building value for our shareholders in long-term sustainable, low cost values for the future. Production, we\u2019re making money in the Americas, copper prices, production in the U.S. is increasing. Our Lone Star project in Eastern Arizona is really exciting. We have a series of ongoing value enhancing opportunities in the U.S., in front of us, and I\u2019m personally really encouraged about future growth in the U.S. In South America, our teams in Peru and Chile, are navigating the pandemic, effectively, we\u2019re restoring production that we have curtailed a year ago. We have achieved these outstanding financial results made possible by the hard work and investments we\u2019ve been making for many years. We\u2019re now generating significant cash flows, which will be sustainable for years in the future. This quarter alone, we had $2 billion of cash flow after capital spending. That\u2019s just remarkable considering where we were just a year ago. Kathleen mentioned, and it\u2019s notable that we reached our debt target, several months earlier than our forecast earlier this year. We ended the quarter with $3.4 billion of net debt. That\u2019s within the targeted range, we said of $3 to $4 billion. We reduced our debt by like 60% over the past year. We\u2019re now positioned in accordance with a financial policy that our board adopted earlier this year, and that we disclose to the market to shift our capital allocation priorities by increasing cash returns to shareholders. As we make discipline investments for future growth of our business. This policy will allow us to maintain a strong balance sheet with high grade credit metrics, while providing cash for increasing shareholder returns, and investing in our company\u2019s long-term future. Slide 4, talks about how we\u2019re devoting significant attention and resources to sustainability initiatives. And this has always been key to our company and our tradition of our company. We are committed to the sustainability principles of ICMM. We\u2019re also moving to certify all of our operations with a Copper Mark, a relatively new industry framework developed by the International Copper Association to ensure responsible production consistent with UN\u2019s sustainability development goals. Today, we lead the industry with six of our operations now certified. In the second quarter, we submitted five additional operating sites to this initiative, and we\u2019ve committed to validate all of our sites to this robust framework. Responsible production is critical in building and maintaining trust, which we\u2019ve earned over the years through long-standing partnerships with communities as we delivered a product copper value by society produced and safe, environmentally sound, innovative manner. Slide 5 talks about electrification, which is key to copper. Majority of copper goes into generating and transmitting electricity, and copper is critical in every aspect of achieving low-carbon goals for the global economy. This ranges from electric vehicles and supported infrastructure to clean energy from wind and solar copper is just simply essential to a green economy. This transition is now just beginning to unfold. It will add significantly to future demand for copper. And as the global leading copper producer Freeport is solidly positioned to benefit from this higher future demand. In addition, now companies around the world are responding to COVID with aggressive fiscal and monetary policies. This alone is creating important near-term copper demand beyond China. China\u2019s consumption remains strong, there\u2019s a mixed economic signals, but even with that demand for copper in China is strong and now it\u2019s higher consumption is being generated from economic recovery in developed countries around the world. And that\u2019s even in the face of an important sector of copper demand automobiles, which is being constrained by this chip problem. So this increasingly important incremental demand outside China, the long-term growth from global \u2013 from growth in emerging markets just as very positive for our outlook. Copper demand is also expanding from technology advances and communications, artificial intelligence applications, expanding connectivity through global infrastructure initiatives and efforts to improve health through using copper to fight viruses and other infections. Slide 6 talks about this growing demand, the global challenges and maintaining much less growing supply makes the outlook for copper compelling. I would say compelling is an understated word and really positive and enthusiastic about it. This recent pullback and copper pricing that we\u2019ve seen, is not altered in any way our conviction of the favorable long-term outlook for copper. This is a decision we made years ago, which underscores our strategy of Freeport to focus on copper, because of its favorable fundamentals, the nature of our assets, and our team. There are always actions that influence sentiment and short-term pricing at any point in time. But beyond that indisputable facts support a positive fundamental outlook for copper. Demand growth is inevitable, maintaining supply or growing supplies challenged, our prices will be required to support major new investments in copper, rising demand scarcity of supplies point to large impending structural deficit supporting much higher future copper prices. Our company has high quality assets, industry-leading experience, highly motivated team will allow us to benefit from these fundamentals. Portfolio of assets in copper business is rare, and not unique in our industry would be difficult not impossible to replicate these assets. With strong growing production, embedded Brownfield, low-risk growth from our large portfolio of undeveloped resources, our assets are extremely valuable in today\u2019s world and will come more valuable as these market develops market depth in some emerging the future. Slide 7 highlights our growing margins and cash flows. We\u2019ve had meaningful volume growth in recent quarters that you\u2019ve all seen this growth will continue. By the year 2021 copper value \u2013 copper volumes are projected to increase 20%, gold volumes 55% over 2020. Then looking forward to 2022, let\u2019s see a further growth of 15% to 20% over 2021 levels. The capital and execution risk to achieve these higher volumes are largely behind us. Our volumes will with low incremental costs. We had expand in margins, the prices ranging for $4 to $5 per pound for copper. We would generate annual EBITDA for 2022 and 2023 of $12 billion to $17 billion of copper with capital expenditures in the range of $2.5 billion a year. Looking back, there was always an overhang for Freeport related to execution risk with this underground development, Political risks in Indonesia, debt levels, you look back over the past three years, we have met and mitigated all these major risks that were overhanging our company. And it\u2019s been a really exciting gratifying time for our company. Slide 8 highlights great progress we\u2019re making with Grasberg underground ramp-up. I\u2019ve just met with Mark Johnson and his team in Indonesia and really congratulated him on the fabulous work they doing even in the face of COVID. In the second quarter, we achieved just under 80% of our target annualized run rates for metal sales, we will \u2013 we\u2019re on track to reach full rates for metal production by the end of the year and our team in Indonesia has just done a fabulous job in the face of dealing with pandemic in a challenging physical environment. We executed well designed operating protocols. We\u2019re dealing with this new upturn in cases in Indonesia in recent weeks. We\u2019re helping to support the government in our local community. We\u2019ve implemented travel other restrictions to mitigate the spread. We\u2019re encouraged by the increasing availability of vaccines at our job site in general in Indonesia. Number of our workers to significant number have already seen vaccines and received vaccines. We have a goal providing vaccines to all of our workforce in the second half of the year and we\u2019re supporting nearby communities and their efforts to respond to COVID. We have a real strong support from the government of Indonesia, a real positive partnership with PT-FI state-owned shareholders on that shareholder mine they were all working together and are aligned. I\u2019ve been working in path for 30 years, over 30 years, and I\u2019m personally proud and gratified by our team\u2019s accomplishments. Since we began investing in the underground over 20 years ago the transition from the open pit that began 18 months ago and dealing with COVID is just remarkable what we\u2019ve been able to do. Planning investing in this transition began in the 1990s, now experiencing the success especially for all of us in Freeport. We now look forward to continuing long-term success and Grasberg by building values in this world-class historic mining district with low-cost, high-volume and sustainable production. Slide 9 shows the multiple options for Brownfield low-risk growth across our global portfolio, increasingly encouraged by the opportunities in the U.S. where we have favorable community support across the board with where we operate, favorable tax situation, and a long history of working in a responsible way. We\u2019re expanding our mine production in Lone Star, Bagdad, other sites and we have exciting new opportunities from technology involving leach recovery from our historical operations. The Lone Star mine, our newest operation situated adjacent to our long-standing operations in Southeast Arizona. There we have strong community support and this new mines performing above design capacity. We\u2019re evaluating expansions of Lone Star\u2019s oxide ores. We\u2019re actually making a lot of money in what normally would be stripping operations. We\u2019re conducting long range planning for the development of a potentially world-class sulfide resource that lies beneath this oxide cover in our historical mining area. We have an opportunity and a strong likelihood of moving forward with constructing a new concentrating the double production in our Bagdad mine in Northwest Arizona. What we expect to finish this project next year. Emerging leaching technology, which I am pumped about provides substantial opportunities for added growth across our portfolio global resources. We\u2019re evaluating attractive expansion operation expansion, opportunity that El Abra mine in Chile, where we\u2019re partnered with CODELCO. This project would require significant capital investment along lead time, but it\u2019s attract large, major future expansion of El Abra is likely, but not now. We\u2019re deferring investment decision on this project until we have more clarity about the mining policy issues currently under consideration by the Government in Chile. We\u2019re also evaluating development of an underground deposit called Kucing Liar in the Grasberg district, operated by PT-FI. This copper gold resources involves the large block cave mine using the substantial infrastructure that we already have in place. We have expertise, long track record, Mark Johnson and his team has come up with revised development plans that make the project less capital intensive, economics better it\u2019s a large operation it\u2019d be a block cave with about 90,000 tons per day. So that\u2019s real big, 6 billion plus tons of copper resource, 6 million ounces of gold. And it fits right in with our plans. We have additional opportunities to invest in projects to support our copper, our carbon reduction, other sustainability goals, including investing to develop clean, renewable energy for our operations and communities. We\u2019re advancing plans for an exciting ESG type project to recover metals from the recycling of electronic devices at our Atlantic Copper processing facilities in Spain. Bottom line, we\u2019re going to be disciplined and devoting capital to new investments. We\u2019re going to be focused on value-added projects supported by long live reserves. We have a long track record of success in developing projects. We have established license to operate and positive relationship and support from communities where we have the opportunities to invest. Slide 10 goes back to Lone Star shows we\u2019re meeting, exceeding expectation. Original plan was 75,000 tons a day, 200 million pounds of copper, we now exceeded this, reaching the targeted rate of 95,000 tons a day on a sustained basis we have take outs capacity to do this yield 285 million pounds of copper. Looking at a further increment that would involve a relatively small investment in tankhouses, mining equipment, we use 300 or more pounds of copper, 80% more than our original design. The product here [ph] though is longer term; we have a major opportunity for Lone Star become a cornerstone asset for our company. Potential resource is 10 times more than our current reserve. As we mined these oxide ores, we\u2019re gaining access to this undermine potentially massive sulfide resource, long-term keystone asset for our company. Slide 11 talks about this reference I made earlier to leaching technology, gaining additional copper from material that\u2019s already mine. We\u2019re progressing this. We have lots of opportunity to apply. It\u2019s an exciting potentially have a new opportunity with low incremental cost and low-carbon footprint. We\u2019re engaged in multiple studies using a range of different technologies internally and externally to capture this value from existing stockpiles. Our estimate now is for 38 billion pounds of copper in these stockpiles. This is a material that\u2019s already been in mines. And if we can recover just 10% to 20% as material it would be like having a major new mine with variable capital and operating costs. A significant portion of this is in our flagship Morenci mine, largest mine in North America, where we are now applying artificial intelligence data analytics to help us understand what\u2019s going on with these leaching performance opportunities. Our team historically was instrumental in unlocking substantial values years ago with the venue SX/EW technology. We\u2019re now focused on taking this leaching technology to the next level by using modern approaches to it. We\u2019ve established a cross functional team of technical experts, metallurgist, mine planners, data scientists, geologists, business analysts, all working together to take full advantage of this really exciting opportunity. Slide 12, we have strong operating franchises in the U.S., South America and Indonesia gained the trust and respect of our partners, our customers, suppliers, financial markets, and more importantly, the workers, communities and host governments where we operate. We have significant large scale project development, operating expertise. Team Freeport has all the capabilities to undertake new projects and responsible, efficient manner. I\u2019m going to close on Slide 13 by recognizing people of Freeport. All around the globe their commitment, dedication, resilience, positive outlook, cooperative spirit is just gratifying. Our team is passionate about the role we\u2019re going to play achieving a better and more sustainable future for everyone. Team Freeport has the capabilities and drive to continue to meet, exceed our own high level of expectations and those of our stakeholders. We\u2019re living in a great, a time of great challenge and exceptional opportunity for our business, that our team, we\u2019re meeting the challenges, embracing the opportunities, our futures by with reported charging ahead responsibly, reliably and relentlessly. Kathleen, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you to talk about our financial results. Kathleen Quirk : Okay, great. Thank you, Richard. And I\u2019m going to start on Slide 15. And just make some brief comments on our operating manner \u2013 matters and go through our financials and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions. Richard talked about the great progress we\u2019re making at Lone Star. We\u2019re very focused now on sustaining the rates to keep our tankhouse full way, which has a capacity of 285 million pounds per year of copper, and looking at potential increments beyond that with relatively small and attractive investments. Richard also mentioned our plans at Bagdad, we\u2019re advancing studies to double the capacity there, and hope to be in a position to qualify a project and commence a project there next year. At Morenci, we\u2019ve started to increase our mining rates, which had been curtailed in the last 12 months. We averaged about 725,000 tons per day of mine material on the second quarter, and are ramping up to reach 800,000 tons per day, by the end of this year, going to 900,000 tons a day in 2023. We\u2019ve also advanced from 2022 to restart of some of Morenci milling capacity that was also idled last year to reduce costs. Now with the improvement in copper prices, these actions result in more profitable production. We\u2019re also very encouraged by the opportunity to add low cost production at Morenci through our Leach technology initiatives. In South America, the teams are continuing to work to restore production to pre-pandemic levels. We continue to target a full restoration at Cerro Verde in 2022. And we\u2019ve been running at about 95% of the mill capacity in recent months. You\u2019ve seen in our press release that the Cerro Verde team reached a new four-year labor agreement with a significant percentage of the workforce during the second quarter. That was in advance of our labor agreement exploration which is coming up at the end of August of this year. We\u2019re very pleased with the win-win outcome of the agreement and now working to conclude a mutually satisfactory agreement with the balance of employees. At El Abra in Chile, we\u2019re well on our way to restoring production levels that were curtailed last year. We\u2019re increasing the stalking rate of material on the leach pads and moving forward to add a new leach pad to accommodate the higher rates. This is capital that was always part of our plan, but was deferred last year as part of the capital conservation plans that we rolled out in April of last year. This allows El Abra to increase production on a sustained basis to about 200 million pounds to 250 million pounds per annum for the next several years. As we assess opportunities for a major expansion there. As Richard talked about Grasberg, we\u2019re continuing to deliver results and generating strong cash flows. As you recall, we started the second quarter was significantly more concentrate inventory than we normally carry. With a strong production volumes and some maintenance downtime at our port, weather issues at quarter end, sales were below our earlier estimates in the quarter. This is a really a short -term timing issue and we expect to be able to work inventory levels down in the second half of this year. We successfully commissioned at Grasberg the second crusher at our Grasberg Block Cave during the quarter, and that\u2019ll provide sufficient capacity for a ramp-up to 130,000 tons per day you\u2019ve seen the performance and the records achieved from the Grasberg Block Cave during the quarter. We\u2019re also moving to advance the installation of our third SAG mill there, that\u2019s been part of our plan to support the higher rates of throughput. We\u2019ve also identified an opportunity to invest in a new mill circuit that will allow us to increase copper and gold production in Indonesia through the achievement of higher mill recoveries when the initial phases of this project and the economics are highly attractive. Our global team also remains focused on cost management and efficiency projects to extend equipment lives improve energy efficiency, and maintenance practices with the use of technology. We have experienced some degree of costs increases this year principally from energy price increases and to a lesser extent the impact on consumables of steel price increases, increased freight costs and sulfuric acid costs. We\u2019ve had partially offsetting these items we\u2019ve had, the benefits of a weaker exchange rate in South America versus the U.S. dollar. The increases in costs have been offset by significant increase in molybdenum prices in recent months. And those who provided a very nice hedge to certain of these cost inflation items. We talk on slide, we\u2019ve seen in the release plans for to meet our commitments in Indonesia for the new smelter. On Slide 16, we provide an update on our plans to meet the commitments that we agreed to with the Indonesian government in 2018 to construct 2 million tons per year of in country processing facility of copper concentrate. We have been advancing the discussions with our Japanese partners to expand the existing smelter at PT Smelting that would fulfill a portion of the obligation. And there are several financial and operating benefits of expanding this facility, which has been expanded very efficiently in the past. After considering various alternatives for the balance of the commitment, we\u2019ve concluded that the best long-term option is to continue with our plans to construct a new Greenfield Smelter in East Java near the existing facilities at PT Smelting. We recently entered into an EPC contract with Chiyoda to construct a 1.7 million ton facility there. And we\u2019re now focused on completing the project as efficiently and as timely as possible. We show in the graph on Slide 16 on the right, the estimated timing of expenditures over roughly a three-year period, FCX is responsible for 49% of these expenditures. We recently completed a new $1 billion bank credit facility for PT-FI to advance these projects and are planning additional debt financing, which can be obtained at attractive rates to fund these activities. As indicated the long-term cost of the financing expected for the smelter, would be offset by a phase out of the 5% export duty. And we show a graph on the bottom of Slide 16, which shows you that the economic impact is not material as the cost of the smelter, would be essentially offset in lower duties, which we\u2019re currently paying. Slide 17, provides a three-year outlook for volumes. These are consistent with our previous guidance. We\u2019re continuing to pursue additional incremental near-term growth opportunities and conducting our longer range development planning. Moving to Slide 18, we show the significance of cash flow generation using these volumes and cost estimates and the prices ranging from $4 to $5 copper and holding, holding gold and molybdenum flat at $1,800 per ounce of gold and $16 per pound of molybdenum. But you see here on these graphs we would generate EBITDA in the range of over $12.5 billion per annum for 2022 and 2023 on average at $4 copper to $17 billion per annum at $5 copper, and at its operating cash flows net of taxes and interest would be $9 billion to $12 billion using these price assumptions. Is demonstrated in the second quarter we\u2019re generating very significant free cash flow and this trend is expected to continue with cash flows significantly above our capital spending, On Slide 19, we include our projected capital of $2.2 billion this year and $2.5 billion in 2022. As you\u2019ll note, we shifted about $100 million in expenditures from 2021 to 2022, which is timing related. And we\u2019ve advanced some capital from future years into 2022 to reflect the timing of additional leach pad construction at Lone Star and the addition of some highly attractive growth spending in Indonesia related to mill recoveries. We\u2019ve entered a period of outstanding free cash flow generation that growing volumes, strong markets and low capital requirements you\u2019ll see on Slide 20, and this is backward looking, but over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve reduced our net debt by $5 billion, and that included $2 billion in the second quarter alone. You\u2019ll see our credit metrics are strong, and less than 0.5 times EBITDA on a trailing 12 month basis, and we\u2019re projecting our credit metrics continue to be strong and improving. As Richard mentioned, we achieved our targeted net debt level several months ahead of our schedule. With our long lived asset base and growing production profile and strong markets will have the ability to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, provide increasing cash returns to shareholders, and build additional values in our asset base. The Slide on 21, just reiterates our financial policy, our performance base payout policy, which was established by our board earlier this year, providing that up to 50% of free cash flow would be used for shareholder returns with the balance available for growth and further balance sheet improvements. And with the recent achievement of our net debt target, we expect our board will consider additional payouts to shareholders with our 2021 results. We\u2019re looking forward to reporting on our continued progress and continuing to build additional values as we go forward. And now, operator, we\u2019d like to open the call up for questions. Richard Adkerson : Kathleen, I want to put an explanation point on your \u2013 the comments you made about cost management. They were going focused on inflation around the world and the impact on mining companies and as Kathleen said we\u2019ve had higher energy costs, our grinding material costs. But Josh Olmstead and our America\u2019s team has just done a great job in helping offset that Mike Kendrick in running our molybdenum business, which is a primary production business and a byproduct business. And with higher molybdenum prices is offsetting some of these cost increases, we\u2019ve got a high gold price would help us Danny Hughes is leading our supply chain group. So a combination of all these things is helping us as a company to really mitigate much of these increases in cost, working with logistics. So, I just wanted to make a note of that because I think it\u2019s important giving \u2013 given all of our concerns about, where inflation is leading us. So, let\u2019s do turn over to questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Emily Chieng of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Emily Chieng : Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. Thanks for the update today and congratulations on getting to a net debt target. So, quickly maybe just following up on Kathleen\u2019s last point then just on capital return, is there a reason why you would wait till the end of full year 2021 before executing that capital returns program and just further on that train of thought there? Is there a preference yet between parts of special dividend or buyback program to shift to a variable dividend strategy? Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, Emily. We\u2019ve just reached the debt \u2013 net debt target at the end of June and so going forward, we would have up to 50% of the cash flows available as we generate them to consider additional payouts to shareholders. Our board will be reviewing this and we do expect that we will be following the policy that will be paying out up to 50% of the excess cash flow. We have not made any conclusions on whether it will be additional dividend payouts or share buybacks. And that\u2019ll be something that will be considered at the time, but the commitment is there to pay strong cash returns to shareholders with our free cash flow. And we expect over the next several months to continue to generate free cash flow. And that\u2019ll continue into next year and beyond. Emily Chieng : Great, that\u2019s helpful. And a quick one, if I could squeeze it in just on Grasberg, I believe that the end of Q1, you reached 75% of your full production there. Can you remind us where we are today, where you\u2019d expect to be at the end of 3Q? And that 100% production level is that a fourth quarter average or an exit rate? Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : 78% was the average. Richard Adkerson : We\u2019re just under 80% right now, in terms of metal production targets. That\u2019s well ahead of schedule. We\u2019ll be at 100% by the end of this year. Emily Chieng : Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : And that\u2019s the average for the fourth quarter Emily, so we\u2019ll \u2013 we expect to hit the run rates in the fourth quarter. Emily Chieng : Perfect. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Kathleen. Thanks, Richard. Richard Adkerson : Thank you, Emily. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. David Gagliano : Hi, thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to actually ask a little bit on the CapEx. I know capital spending changes. I know, Kathleen, you flagged it, by time I missed some of the commentary there. Can you walk through how much of the increase incremental sort of net increase are $200 million is just general cost creep, versus pulling projects forward? And what are those projects? Again, if you can just give us a little more detail on that? That\u2019s my first question. Then just since I\u2019m only getting one I just have another parts \u2013 question, which is the \u2013 just if you could talk a little bit about there\u2019s slight changes to the exit rates or extraction exit rate targets between the Block Cave and the DMLZ Zone. Block Cave went up, DMLZ Zone went down. And I was wondering, if you can just speak to the reason behind those changes? Thanks. Kathleen Quirk : On the capital, we shifted a $100 million of capital from 2021 to 2022. And that really was a timing matter we haven\u2019t been spending as quickly as what was originally budget and budgeted. So, we\u2019ve just \u2013 $100 million is related to the timing. We\u2019ve also brought forward some capital that was in our plans in the future, dealing with constructing new leach pads at Lone Star. And then we also \u2013 the only new thing that we\u2019ve added in 2022 is this project that we talked about with respect to increasing mill recoveries at Grasberg and that I\u2019ll be spent over a multi-year period. It\u2019s roughly $400 million in total, but we\u2019ve got $100 million scheduled in 2022. Ultimately, that will add volumes. We expect, on the order of 50 million pounds of copper and 50,000 ounces of gold and it\u2019s a very attractive and short payout project. So that\u2019s a positive and that\u2019ll be used as one of the projects, just one of many, hopefully that will be used with our other 50% of cash flows. There really weren\u2019t \u2013 on the second question there really weren\u2019t any material changes with respect to the Deep MLZ and Grasberg, Block Cave. We update the plans every quarter. And there were really only minor changes between the two and really that the long-term plan for Grasberg and Deep MLZ is consistent with the previous forecasts and Mark, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything there. But it\u2019s \u2013 we certainly very much in line with our previous forecasts. Mark Johnson : Yes, the only minor changes throughout 2022 until, SAG3 is the mine plan is, or the mine rates are constrained by the mill throughput. What we did is, there\u2019s been some minor modifications, some of the values of GDC. During this constraint period, the grades of GDC are coming up. So, we swapped some of the GDC material for the higher value for slightly lower value material from the Deep MLZ. Richard Adkerson : Dave, good to hear your voice, let me just say, the higher capital spending is a positive. We\u2019ve come out of a period of time with capital constraints. Now, we\u2019re spending capital, not huge incremental amounts some of its timing, but to create new values. And the Deep MLZ is a huge success story, because we\u2019ve successfully met, manage the size of necessity issues that we encountered earlier. So in Mark\u2019s point, the key to our future success is these mine rates, we need to build a mine rates up. And we\u2019re successfully doing that. And we\u2019re dealing with this constraint at the mill by building SAG3 and making other investments. But the key to our future success was meeting our mine rate targets. And that\u2019s been a key for 15, 20 years. And for us to be able to achieve that is just something that we all feel so good about, and congratulating our team for doing that over the years. David Gagliano : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much. Richard Adkerson : Thanks, David. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Chris LaFemina : Hi, Richard. Hi, Kathleen, thank you for taking my question. My question was going to be about Grasberg and the shipping issues there. But actually, your answer to the last question brings something else to mine, which is your organic growth pipeline. So, it\u2019s really interesting how each quarter, you seem to identify a little bit more incremental volumes that you might be able to get out of some of your existing assets, you have the this mill project now the mill recovery project at Grasberg you have potential smaller expenses at Lone Star, low capital intensity, not a whole lot of new incremental volumes, but there is growth there potentially, anyway, that a lot of us may be we\u2019re not aware of. However, when I look at your production guidance at Grasberg or to the overall company, the guidance has not been increased to reflect any of this potential growth. And the question regarding that is, is that because these projects are not yet reflected in guidance, or is it just that they\u2019re small and there\u2019s a lot of moving parts here? And, it\u2019s kind of a rounding to what your guidance was? So, how do we think about the production beyond, say 2022, 2023 and how this manufacturer guidance? Kathleen Quirk : Yes, I think it\u2019s the ladder Chris. The Grasberg mill project wouldn\u2019t come in terms of the recoveries until 2024. And it\u2019s, within the rounding, but I do believe we have some upside. As we look forward, I do believe we have some upside on a consolidated basis from these initiatives. That potentially could come in to 2022 and 2023. Chris LaFemina : Okay, thank you. Richard Adkerson : Chris, let me say, this is the complicated business, I mean, we get to these numbers, and we look and see how that they look. But underneath that, they\u2019re always unexpected things that jump up, and in terms of, there\u2019s new challenge in measuring grade, these column heights in the underground development a large and so being able, we had higher grades, first quarter, slightly lower grades a second, that\u2019s just going to be a feature of what we have to deal with. So, there are just a lot of moving parts. Our team around the world keeps finding ways to incrementally improve things, those will unfold into our numbers over time, and there\u2019ll be a lot of moving parts. Shipping, for those of you who follows for a long period of time knows that, that\u2019s always a timing issue, that Grasberg afford there\u2019s a very shallow point of, a shallow sea there. We have a relatively complicated historical loading operation there. We have to lighter concentrates out to ships and in weather, shipping schedules, logistic issues will always have a timing impact. I just come back again. The real key to us is mine rates, mining rates incrementally improve things and that\u2019s just an ongoing process that we think. Chris LaFemina : And sorry, is the shipping some of the shipping issues at Grasberg many of which are kind of ordinary and normal types of things? Is there a COVID impact there as well? Was that a factor in the last quarter? Was that not a reason for the shipping problem? Kathleen Quirk : No, not really, we had some maintenance that we were doing on the ship loaders, which impacted us earlier in the quarter. And then we got hit by weather at the end of the quarter. So that\u2019s, that was really, what was it wasn\u2019t really COVID related. Chris LaFemina : Okay, thank you. Richard Adkerson : We early of action to I mean, this is just an example. It wasn\u2019t major, but it has an impact. We have concentrated pipelines to go from the highlands down to the port, with a schedule plan, maintenance of some things happening, we had to advance this plan, that plan maintenance. So nothing unusual. This is typical of our operations there, since then, started ramping up the Grasberg in the 1990s. And so it\u2019ll be part of the things we\u2019ll have to deal with in the future. It just not the focus of our success, focus for success with this mine rate, ramp-up. Chris LaFemina : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Alex Hacking : Yes. Hi, good morning, Richard and Kathleen. You have the slide on the new leaching technology. I\u2019m very curious, in your view on this low grade sulfide, chalcopyrite leaching technology, it seems very promising. There\u2019s a lot of impressive people associated with it. It sounds like; you guys are testing it out. How do you, personally what\u2019s your view on the technology that doesn\u2019t seem promising to you? And then how do you judge sort of the potential future impact on Freeport and the copper industry more broadly, like 10 years from now, this technology plays out? How much additional copper do you think that Freeport could be producing? And how much additional copper do you think, could be produced globally using this technology? Thank you. Richard Adkerson : So Alex, and thanks for the question. It\u2019s, I want to make clear if there\u2019s not one technology, in play here, there\u2019s a series of efforts by different parties to develop different technologies. We have our own R&D work going on. And we\u2019re looking across the board and how this might apply to us. I think we are specially situated to take advantage of it because we have these large number and size of pass reaching operation, some of which are now totally inactive, that we can look to apply these to, so we have a special opportunity in industry. Others have some, but we have a special opportunity to look at this in two ways. One of it is to use the leaching technology and by the way, we\u2019re supplementing that with this artificial intelligence, data analytics opportunity to measure the impact of all this, but to apply this to inactive and existing leaching, leach pads, that we have a large abundance for us. So that\u2019s one thing. And then aspirationally it might provide a way to recover material from mining operations that would otherwise have to be recovered through mill investments. And it could be looking ahead an opportunity to minimize capital by recovering low grade sulfide deposits that would otherwise have to be mined and milled. So it\u2019s early stages, we don\u2019t have complete answers. I just want to share with you how exciting it is. It\u2019s an opportunity for us, opportunity for others the industry. This is not a shill all tight game changer for the fundamentals of copper supply [ph]. Kathleen Quirk : On Slide 11, the 38 billion pounds that are identified here. That represents material that\u2019s already been mined, that is not in our reserves, not in any of our production plans. And so just recovering, a small percentage of that ends up being potentially over time, a fairly large number. But Josh, you want to make some comments on your perspective? Josh Olmsted : Sure, thanks, Kathleen. Yes, just as Richard and Kathleen have talked to, it\u2019s really exciting with respect to the opportunity there. The thing that I think, for us that\u2019s unlocking it, even more than just the various technologies that are out there that we\u2019re studying and researching and running different pilot tests on is the combination of that, with the data analytics that Richard touched on. The data analytics that in the processes that we learned over the last several years in our application of that technology, on the milling side has now opened our eyes to opportunities on the leaching side. And that in combination with the various technologies is really exciting for us, because it\u2019s allowing us to look at things in a way that we haven\u2019t ever looked at previously. And we\u2019ve started to see some of the benefits of that at Morenci, as we\u2019ve done some of this pilot work, and that\u2019s, what\u2019s really looked ahead us getting us excited about what the potential is going forward. The other thing that I would note is, as Richard said, it\u2019s not, what I would call a fundamental game changer or step change for the industry. And it happens over time. But it\u2019s really low incremental costs, low-carbon footprint and an incremental adder as we go forward. But it\u2019s really exciting. There\u2019s lots of energy, if I think about the similar things that we saw with our agile efforts earlier, we\u2019re seeing similar things on the leaching side, as we engage with various levels of the organization, the employee engagement and the excitement and the passion and the ideas that they\u2019re bringing to the table, in combination with the models that we\u2019re generating is really good, I think untap or tap into I should say, that these opportunities bring value for us. Richard Adkerson : Yes, I got Cory Stevens is leading this had a session with this new team that\u2019s been formed. It\u2019s a large, Freeport is a large number of people recall him and his guys are adding to this, and I just walked away from this is a new opportunity. You\u2019ve heard me talk about years, for years about the outlook for the copper market being so positive. The assets that we have, the undeveloped reserves, the undeveloped resources we have. This is beyond that. This is not even it\u2019s not reserves, of course, it\u2019s not in our resources. So this is a brand new opportunity to be significant for Freeport, and nobody\u2019s better situated than us to take advantage of it. Alex Hacking : Thanks, I appreciate the color. Now, I\u2019ve read some other, sorry as I can say, I\u2019ve read some of the comments that, this could maybe add, 5% to global copper production on the long run. So, but sounds like, you think this is going to be more kind of longer dated and extending life of mine, and not really that kind of a potential game changer. Appreciate it. Thanks. Richard Adkerson : Me too early to say that Alex, way too early. Alex Hacking : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Carlos De Alba : Yes. Thank you very much, Richard and Kathleen, just continuing on the growth opportunities. I wonder, if you could update us on the 200 million pounds per year target that you had before the pandemic, you\u2019re driven by the innovation and productivity enhancements in Americas, is that get another growth opportunity for you guys or is more \u2013 or is not that now embedded in the praise that you have been describing today, just now in this call. Kathleen Quirk : That is embedded. We\u2019ve continued that project. We internalized it. We were doing some external work and we to cut back on capital and operating we externalized \u2013 internalized it and that agile work way and using artificial intelligence is embedded in now in everything that we do. So that is in our plans, I\u2019d say the one area where it\u2019s not is at Cerro Verde, because we have not been able to get the mill, we\u2019re running roughly 95% of the pre-pandemic levels. We had plans prior to that to move well above 400,000 tons a day. And so I think with the pandemic passing, at some point, we will be able to go back to those initiatives at Cerro Verde and those are not in our plans. But in the year end they are. Richard Adkerson : This is not like building a concentrator to one time deal. It\u2019s an ongoing deal, we\u2019ll continue to add it, as Kathleen said, we\u2019ve been limited to what we could do with Cerro Verde the world\u2019s \u2013 with the world\u2019s largest concentrating milling operations are and because of our focus on mine rate ramp-up. At Grasberg, we haven\u2019t yet brought all those new tools and skills and opportunities, technology, the PT-FI and we\u2019ll be doing that in the future. So this is not a one-time deal, but an ongoing part of our business going forward. And our team is really bought into it. Carlos De Alba : All right. That\u2019s clear. And then just if I may ask on the smelter financing. So the idea still to get a broad financing for this venture initiative, and that means that from a cash flow perspective for Freeport it doesn\u2019t jeopardize the potential increasing in dividends or returns to shareholders correct, that you will be getting the money from the banks or whoever you get the money from. And therefore, the cash flow generation that the company has still allows for you guys to pay dividends and shares. Kathleen Quirk : That\u2019s correct. Yes. The debt service would affect our dividend to the extent of 49% of the debt service. But that\u2019s all said with a duty phase out. So really, the dividends to FCX are not expected to be impacted. Richard Adkerson : And the costs of the smelter are tax deductible to PT-FI. Carlos De Alba : Then the financing costs you mean return? Richard Adkerson : No, I\u2019m talking about the operating costs and so forth. Carlos De Alba : Okay. Richard Adkerson : Appreciation. This is all of the PT-FI though. You nailed it, Marcos [ph], in your analysis. I\u2019m just pointing out that you\u2019ve got the relief from the 5% export duty. You\u2019ve got an operations where the depreciation and operating costs are tax deductible in the consolidated Indonesian tax return for PT-FI, which is substantial Indonesian taxpayers. The government gets almost 50% of the economics at PT-FI through taxes and royalties. Now, they have an equity ownership of 50%. So, 70% or more of the economics of Indonesia go to the government. FCX retains the interest is essentially all the interest we had going into these negotiations, which were years. I didn\u2019t think we could do. But what a fabulous outcome for all parties we had in 2018. Carlos De Alba : All right. Excellent. Thank you very much. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, Carlos. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Orest Wowkodaw : Hi, good morning. Just given what\u2019s happening in Chile and Peru with respect to potentially materially higher taxation of royalties in the future. I\u2019m just wondering if that is changing or thinking at all in terms of future growth, and whether we could see Freeport look to perhaps develop deposits outside of those countries in some of the emerging fronts, maybe something like Ecuador or others. Richard Adkerson : Excellent point. 40% of today\u2019s copper supply comes from Chile and Peru, 40%. And now we have both countries going through the political process that looking to get more for the governments away from the miners. We don\u2019t know how all this will turn out and it\u2019s going to take time to know that. Just certified the new President in Peru, Chile\u2019s got a long-term process looking at their constitution. We\u2019ve already said, that the impact in Chile is causing us to delay a decision on a world-class expansion opportunity, we have in El Abra. Other miners are also going to be affected by this. We really don\u2019t know what the outcome is. Bottom line, this is going to be supportive of future prices. Kathleen Quirk : Our U.S. assets more valuable to your second point, we\u2019re not planning to go outside of our geographic footprint. We have opportunities in the U.S. and elsewhere. Orest Wowkodaw : Okay. Just as a follow-up. I mean, I know you have stability agreement in place of Cerro Verde, I think tell about, I think it\u2019s about 2029. But, I mean, given some of the comments from the new President in Peru, I mean, how much confidence do you have that that\u2019s going to be honored? Richard Adkerson : Well, you look back over our shoulder, there have been other Presidents in Peru overtime that have gone into office with similar types of comments, and when they get into office and reality of the importance of the mining industry to support their economies, become self evident. We don\u2019t know now. We\u2019re working with the rest of the industry in Peru to present a case by the importance of copper mining to that country. But we will have to work our way through this. It is an uncertainty. We don\u2019t have a significant growth opportunity in Peru, but we have a very substantial operation in Cerro Verde that significant in terms of our current and future levels of copper production. And so it wouldn\u2019t be helpful, are instructed to try to play the outcome for all this. We do have a strong stabilization agreement, which is relatively new replaced an older one, and it\u2019s stronger. But as we\u2019ve always done will work with the industry will try to work cooperatively with the government communities to contribute to Indonesia\u2019s efforts to relieve poverty, and that I mean, Peru\u2019s efforts, really poverty in that country. Orest Wowkodaw : Thank you for the color. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Abhi Agarwal with Deutsche Bank. Abhi Agarwal : Thanks. Thank you. Morning Richard and Kathleen, thanks a lot for the call. I just had one follow-up question to the previous question. So given you are focusing on Bagdad and Lone Star resource development over next year, I know it\u2019s early days, but when do you think you\u2019ll be able to make a decision? And is there any sort of CapEx guidelines here? Kathleen Quirk : Well, with Lone Star where we\u2019re working this incrementally. We\u2019ve already been running this higher than the design rate, and we\u2019ve got plans and studies looking at is there a further increment and those will be sorted out in the next several months. With respect to Bagdad, that is a major project and we\u2019re advancing our engineer \u2013 our studies, feasibility studies, we\u2019re looking at all facets of water and tailings. And as I said, I\u2019m hopeful that we will be in a position to be able to qualify that project next year. We don\u2019t have the final capital expenditure estimates we\u2019ve been working to try to find mill setups that would be lower capital intensity than a traditional mill, but that work is still underway. Abhi Agarwal : Got it. Thank you. And if I could squeeze in one more question, please. So, if I look at Slide 7, with the 2Q Slide 7 and compared to the 1Q, the EBITDA sensitivities haven\u2019t changed, even though the gold price and the moly price assumptions have gone up. So is that basically a function of unit costs being assumed to be higher in 2022, 2023? Am I \u2013 did I missed something? Kathleen Quirk : No. We do have some higher costs baked into our numbers with respect to the items we talked about earlier, principally energy and \u2013 more than offsetting the impact for these higher gold and molybdenum prices, but these are order of magnitude rounded numbers it should be slightly above these numbers, but we just continued with the order of magnitude that we previously presented. But we are including some cost inflation in our revised forecast. Abhi Agarwal : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Glick with JPMorgan. Michael Glick : Hey, good morning. Just one question for me. As it relates to the drought in the Southwestern U.S., I mean, it seems like a pretty tough situation there. And I know, agriculture is a lot bigger deal than mining in terms of water usage. But could you maybe speak to any potential impacts from that on operations and costs and just remind us of your water agreements in place? Richard Adkerson : It\u2019s \u2013 it is a concerning of the level of Colorado River, which is one of the major sources of water for operations. But this is not a new problem. We\u2019ve been doing with this consistently over the years. And we have taken steps, with communities with Native American groups, with a farming community to deal with it. So, we don\u2019t see \u2013 we see this is an ongoing process that we will have to devote resources and management to we don\u2019t see any kind of crisis emerging. But we\u2019re going to work cooperatively with everybody to try to conserve water when we do a great job right now with our conservation, reuse of water, and let it\u2019s going to be an ongoing management deal. All of that\u2019s built into our current cost structure and we won\u2019t anticipate major changes in that looking forward. Michael Glick : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with VRP. Michael Dudas : Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. Turning back to the smelter, with the timeline of a 2024 completion, as Chiyoda, which I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a competitive process, is it a fixed price contract, is there a healthy enough contingency to take to respect all the potential changes with COVID and the supply chain issues, which everybody is certain to worry more about, and is their comfort level that the government along with PT-FIs those type of contract structure that would be there to achieve that target? Kathleen Quirk : There is contingency in our estimate. It is not a fixed price contract for all the reasons that you just mentioned. We want to be able to help manage the costs and didn\u2019t want to have a lot of risks baked into the capital that may or may not occur. So, we felt this was the right structure, there\u2019s risk sharing within the contract. The government understands the situation in terms of COVID, we were delayed over the last 12, 15 months associated with the project. And the current situation is something we\u2019re also monitoring very closely. But we\u2019re keeping the government informed regularly about the timeline. And our commitment is to \u2013 with Chiyoda is to get this done as timely as possible, but recognizing their certain things that will be outside of our control, like the current COVID situation. Michael Dudas : And that 2.8 billion big change from maybe what was bought about two, three, four, several years ago? Kathleen Quirk : Well, the scope is different. We had previously we were thinking of having two lines at the smelter for 2 million tons total and we reduced it to 1.7 tons, because of the expansion opportunity at PT Smelting. So the scope is a little different. And yes, there have been some changing cost factors you\u2019ve seen all the \u2013 what those are in terms of where construction costs are currently. But we\u2019ve done a good bit of value engineering over this period with Chiyoda, but all parties are committed to having an open book and making this the smelter as successful as possible and bringing it online as cost efficiently as possible. And so we were in the range of $3 billion, $2.5 billion, $3 billion before, but there\u2019s been some pluses and minuses. And we\u2019re slightly above that now. Michael Dudas : The open book risk sharing is definitely the way go here. Thanks a lot Kathleen. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Matthew Murphy with Barclays. Matthew Murphy : Hi, I\u2019m wondering as you\u2019re getting close to full throughput at Grasberg here. If you can give any color on underground mining costs, thinking like on a per ton basis, where you\u2019re at \u2013 where you\u2019re aiming to get and is it, where you had hoped to be? Richard Adkerson : Yes. We\u2019re achieving where we hope to be no question about that. We have to deal with some of these general factors, but just achieving the volumes having the gold credit, and high grades of copper, just allow us to do it, Mark, do you want to comment on this? Mark Johnson : Yes. We\u2019ve had a lot of focus on operating unit rates. And we\u2019re very close to where we want to be, I think there\u2019s still some opportunities and just be more efficient with some of the mining. Obvious that GDC, the train haulage system has proved to be very efficient. That\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a completely unmanned operation and that\u2019s going very well. Deep MLZ the fracking is helping out, we\u2019re seeing that the cave is continuing to mature, a lot less secondary blasting. So a lot of these things are settling down. But I\u2019d say it\u2019s very much in within the forecast that we had, and we think there\u2019s still some opportunities to continue to improve. Matthew Murphy : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Jatinder Goel with Exane BNP Paribas. Jatinder Goel : Hi, good morning. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Just one question on those administrative fines in Indonesia, now, we\u2019re looking at 2024 timeline, and looks like you\u2019ve taken a minor provision in your accounts as well, any color you can provide on where we are on that discussion with the government? And is there any accessibility these fines should not be levied and should not be recovered to the same extent, as indicated in media previously? Kathleen Quirk : Yes. We worked with the government during the quarter, and this third party that the government engaged and we engaged to review our performance against the plan and the schedule and what was related to the pandemic. And they looks like the fine will be in the $16 million range, which we\u2019ve fully accrued in the quarter we had previously accrued $13 million. And so it looks like that is behind us. We also with this provided a new schedule to the government of what the progress is expected to be. And so that is what will be measured against in the future. So, we\u2019re not expecting this to be an ongoing matter and it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re pleased with the resolution of it. Jatinder Goel : Understood. That\u2019s very clear. Kathleen, if I can ask you very quick one, on moly, how sustainable do you think current strong prices are? And do you have much flex in the system to respond with better volumes from year to time the mines? Kathleen Quirk : On the latter part of that we are looking at, we\u2019ve been operating primary mines are below their capacity. We are looking at potential options to increase production from the Climax mine. In terms of prices, we don\u2019t predict prices, but the market is Mike can tell you is been very tight. And we\u2019re seeing that that continue even during the summer months. And I don\u2019t know Mike you want to add? Richard Adkerson : Our Molybdenum business, it\u2019s a great business and leverage to prices and we\u2019re able to flex. Mike you want to make a comment on that? Mike Kendrick : Sure. Yes, Kathleen is absolutely right, that we\u2019re looking at how we can expand production at Climax and putting together a ramp-up plan for that to respond to the economic conditions. And then with regards to price, I think the predominant feature is that the vast majority of Western Molybdenum comes from byproduct production. And right now, you\u2019re starting to see that you don\u2019t have these copper mines that are coming online and it correlates to our general story of how important copper is, but also that it\u2019s hard to find resources, bring them on and they come with molybdenum. So, we think there\u2019s kind of a natural correlation between the copper and the molybdenum story. And there\u2019s definitely a structural deficit this summer. And we\u2019ll have to see how it plays out over time. Jatinder Goel : Excellent, thank you so much. Richard Adkerson : All right. Well, thanks, everyone. It\u2019s exciting times the best is yet to come. So hang on. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction]. I would like to hand the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen Quirk : Great. Thank you. And good morning, everyone. And welcome to the Freeport McMoRan conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported our third quarter 2021 operating and financial results and a copy of today's press release and the slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet. And anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include Forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials, and to the risk factors described in FCX 's SEC filings. On the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Johnson, our CEO of Indonesia, Josh Olmsted, Chief Operating Officer for the Americas, Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer, Rick Coleman, who runs our engineering and construction business, And Mike Kendrick who runs a Molybdenum business. I will start by briefly summarizing our financial results, and then we'll turn the call over to Richard, who will go through the materials in our slide presentation materials. After our formal remarks, we'll take your questions. Today, FCX reported third quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stock of 1.4 billion. That was $0.94 per share. And adjusted net income attributable to common stock of 1.3 billion or $0.89 per share. The $0.89 per share excludes net credits totaling $0.05 a share primarily associated with tax credits related to the release evaluation allowances at PT Freeport, Indonesia and a gain on the sale of FCX 's remaining cobalt business. The details of our adjusted net income are reflected in our press release on page roman numeral 7, we generated adjusted EBITDA for the Third quarter of roughly $3 billion. And we've got a reconciliation of the EBITDA on page 37 of our slide deck. Favorable results in the third quarter reflects strong execution by our team, growing our production volumes safely, efficiently, and responsibly. Our sales volumes for the quarter for copper exceeded a billion pounds that approximated our prior estimate in July of 2021 and was above the year-ago period. Gold sales of 400,000 ounces for approximately 12% higher than our prior estimate and also significantly above the year-ago period. We also benefited from positive pricing for copper. Our third quarter average realized copper price was 420 per pound. That was substantially above the year-ago period. And gold prices were slightly below the year-ago period. We also benefited from improved Molybdenum prices in the quarter, where prices nearly doubled from the year-ago period. Net unit cash costs were $1.24 per pound in the third quarter. That was lower than our estimate going into the period. And we had some good performance from our leach production, which reduced our unit production cost in the period. Generated strong cash flows and we've been doing that every quarter this year. Generating $2 billion of operating cash flow, which exceeded capital spending of roughly 500 million during the quarter. Our balance sheet is strong. We ended the quarter with consolidated debt of 9.7 billion and consolidated cash of 7.7 billion, which resulted in net debt of $2 billion. We had no borrowings under our credit facility and have $3.5 billion available. We also announced today some liability management where we called for redemption. Our outstanding notes due 2022, that has a total principal amount of 524 million. I now want to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the slide presentation materials. Richard go ahead. Richard Adkerson : Thanks to everyone. Thank you for joining our call. Really pleased to be able to review our strong performance for this quarter, where we are with the Company. It's a special time several years ago in call I said if we could be fortunate enough to ramp up our underground production at Gras berg at the same time, we had a positive copper market, it would be a great time for Freeport. And this is really a great time for us. We're going to focus on the future. But just one comment. I was last at jobsite two years ago in October, and we were just completing the mining of the open pit and starting to ramp up the Grasberg Block Cave. And so during this 2-year period, our progress has been nothing short of remarkable. And I really congratulate our team at job site but also in the Americas for what we've been able to accomplish even in the face of all the distractions and challenges that COVID brought on. I hope you and all your family and your colleagues are staying healthy. This thing's not over. We're keeping our guards up, I encourage you to as well. We have at Freeport, had a successful program to get vaccines to our people internationally. Over 90% of our people in South America are now vaccinated and 85% in Popolo and Indonesia are vaccinated. We continue to be challenged as some of our operations in the United States, which is come in across our country unfortunate. But we're encouraging our people and making some progress there. But the news is we've been able to meet the challenge of COVID and accomplished what we're reporting to you today. Our copper volumes have grown over 20% from a year ago, and that reflects this really exceptional execution of our business. With these prices that we have today, we're generating very strong margin. Our EBITDA doubled from a year ago. Our strong operating cash flows that Kathleen mentioned in the quarter are really exceptional. And particularly when you look at our capital expenditures, we're only $500 million. Now this is generating cash flows too. Now that we've met our debt target and we met that at the end of June, way ahead of what we anticipated at the beginning of the year, we're now focused on managing these cash flows and that's a happy time for us looking at investments for our long-term future. At the same time, we are being able to increase returns to shareholders and maintain a really strong balance sheet, which is going to be real hallmark of our Company going forward. Everybody is focused on carbon reduction, climate initiatives, and 26 coming up next month. It's going to be all over the papers. We published our second report on our climate initiatives. We put a lot more resources into it. We're really focused on it. As a Company compared with other natural resource Companies, we have much limited scope 3 emissions and other natural resources, and we're really focused on our scope 1 and 2 emissions, and have a plan to achieve targets that we believe are realistic and achievable. and the other 28 members of ICMM International Council, mining and metals, which I chair, have signed a commitment to work towards having zero net carbon emissions by 205. And everybody is working hard on it. We're also continuing to make progress to certify all of our operations with international copper associations, Copper Mart. And this clearly demonstrates our commitment to responsible production. You recall that I became chairman earlier this year. When that occurred, I made a real commitment to build the kind of board that the Company like ours really needs and deserves. We've added four new members in 2021. We added two this quarter., Marcela Donadio and Sara Lewis. That brings us to a total of eight independent directors, which have a broad range of experience. And it's going to be a real strength of our Company going forward. Underlying all of this is the fundamental outlook for coppers, incredibly favorable. Copper's role in the economy and as the economy changes with global investments and infrastructure, and I know we have a controversy here, but countries around the world are going to build infrastructure. Less-developed countries are going to develop. The world is getting increasingly focused on electrification with modern technology, 5G, and artificial intelligence. And then a new major element that people are talking about and recognizing now for demand that's coming, it's not here in real significance now, is all the investments that people are going to be making to reduce carbon. And across the board, those investments are result in significant demands for copper. And then you got, we'll talk about this more, commodity really supported by supply factors. I mentioned our climate report reported in September is on our website. I encourage you all to take a look at it. It really details work in much more comprehensive way than we did in our first report last year about how our Company will work to reduce green house gas emissions, and how we are approaching climate scenario analysis and reporting in line with recommendations of the task force and climate related financial disclosures. We are, as a Company and as an organization, firmly committed to this. We see it in our everyday lives with the forest fires and our operations in the West and hurricanes on the Gulf Coast, weather patterns all around the world. We all know we need to do this, and we're committed to do our part for our Company. And as I said, as the rest of the world, the rest of industry focuses on this, it's going to create a lot of copper demand. We established a car target to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia, about 30%, which is a new target for us. We have this aspirational goal of net zero by 2050. Our two big issues are 1. The coal power plant in Indonesia, lot of power required for our massive operations there. We're now investing in a dual fuel powered plant there. We're looking to a future of power being generated by biodiesel initially natural gas, looking at hydro-power opportunity. So we're working on that. And then the other major issue is how to convert our big haul truck fleet, massive trucks, diesel driven, to how to work with our suppliers and others in the industry to convert that to electrical powered or hydrogen powered vehicles. We'll hear a lot more about this in the -- we just know that our Company is committed to deal with our own emissions and to work with industry and communities in general to meet the things we need to meet with climate change. Copper's essential to that, just the strategic metal in many respects for the future. The world is getting increasingly electrified and more than 65% of the world's copper is used to deliver electricity. And when you look at electric vehicles, charging stations, clean power from wind, solar, all of these require significantly more copper to operate than the way that things are currently doing now. And so it's a challenging time for us and we're serious about this challenge but it is also a great opportunity for us as a responsible global copper producer. So we've got these rising demand and supply is a real issue for this industry. Even today, with the economic uncertainties in China and globally, copper inventories are remarkably low. The LME recently hit a 47 year-low. Shanghai was lower than it's been since 2009. And while we will be some new projects that were started 4 or 5 years ago, delayed by COVID coming on stream in the next couple of years, that will bring some new, new copper to the market. Beyond that, the coverage is pretty empty in terms of new supply projects of any significance. And the world today, the opportunities are smaller. They're more difficult to develop and produce. Permitting still requires a very long period of time. And so the industry really 1. Has an issue with meeting the demand with supply. And that's going to require actions across a lot of fronts, more scrap, some substitution. But copper, as a commodity, is so much better than any alternatives that in whatever environment you can envision for the world going forward absent some doomsday situation in the global economy. It's just in a situation of where copper prices have to be strong, and in my view stronger than they are today. Turning to slide 7, what this means for our Company is with all the work we've done today in preparing our business and building our assets, we're going to have really significant margins in cash flows. Six years ago, our Company was facing real challenges and we worked our way through that very successfully. As we were working so hard and facing dealing with some real tough problems, in dealing with unsustainable debt level at that time. We all looked at ourselves and talked about the assets we had in our Company, the long-term assets, the quality of the team, our track record, our capabilities, and that's really what inspired us all to work so hard to get to where we are today. Copper volumes are 20%, gold volumes are 50% higher than they were a year ago and they'll be growing another 15%, 20% next year. It's a great feeling as we were ending the quarter and looking at September in particularly, to recognize that the capital and execution risk to achieve these higher volumes which we've been pointing to for a very long period of time, Those risks are behind us. The higher volumes are coming with low incremental cost. At copper prices from $4 to $5, we would generate annual EBITDA for the next couple of years on the order of $12.5 billion to $17 billion per year. And our capital expenditures, and we have a new project that we'll be talking about in Indonesia, including that our capital expenditures will range on the order of $2 to $2.5 billion a year. So that means we're where we're wanting to be, where we're targeting to, where we thought we would be. But the important part is, now we've done it, we're just not pointing to it. And slide 8 shows that this ramp up of the Grasberg Mine. man that was -- this slide looks like this was really a straight forward, easy to accomplish deal. There are challenges everyday out there. I'd say this is the most complicated mine in the world, when it was an open pit mine. And now in the industries historically, a historic, large underground mine, is,-- it is truly remarkable. In third quarter was 90% of our target annualized rate. We were at target in September. We're now on track to reach full rates metal production by the end of the year, and our team in Indonesia just needs to be congratulated and recognized for meeting all of these targets and strategically so important for us. And it was a real matter of concern back in March of 2020 when we had COVID facing this. It's easy on paper, but man, it's a challenge every day. And I had a great meeting with our team in advance of this call. The excitement, morale, and so forth is just exceptional. It's really something special for our Company. And we now look forward to taking the steps that we need to take to sustain this for the life of this. We're beginning to talk with the government and getting positive initial responses about extending our operating rights beyond 2041 Because of the ramp up, the limit of the operating rights, we haven't done much exploratory drilling, extension type core drilling. Our feeling and our confidence is there's a lot more resources beyond what we're developing now. And we're explaining that to the government. As I said, initial reactions is positive. And I'm confident that we will not be facing an end -- this operation 2041, that makes no sense for any stakeholder. We need to look at it to take advantage of the long-term resources available to us. Slide 9 talks about our growth of our Company. A real strength of Freeport is its large reserve base, 30, 35 years life in it. Proved and probable reserves, which gives us a sustainable ability of our operations for very long period of time. But beyond that, we have resources that are even larger than our reserves that are ground Fuel Resources, which is really important in the Americas Because that means that we are not trying to permit gain community approval to build new mines. We have great support for our communities. We've involved them. We share our benefits with them. And so as a result, we have these multiple options for long-term ground field, low-risk growth. And I'm really encouraged by the opportunities we had in United states where we have great community support. We have the benefit of strong communities and supporting schools, hospitals, education, great workforce, great community. We pay our people really well. We make sure they have living wages. And we're sensitive to them. So here we see across the board in Baghdad, in northwest Arizona, long reserve life, do a concentrated project, we can double production. Lone Star. You're going hear a lot about Lone Star in Freeport's future. This -- this resource has a long-term opportunity to be a flagship asset. It's just across the ridge from Morenci, the largest mine in North America. We honestly believe this can be another long-term Morenci. And It's got -- right now, we're having real success with our new oxide mine, we started this past year. It's expanding, we've got further expansions. We're able to make it economic by using available production facilities at our nearby Safford mine that's winding down. And then processing this oxide is really a stripping operation for this enormous sulfide deposit. going on now. There's a big sulfide resource there. It would be a big capital projects to build a mill with desalinization plant. We're looking at a number of alternatives there. Chile is going through a process of the government. The people assessing how they're going to tax and what's the fiscal regime is going to be for mining projects. We're going to wait to see how that plays out before making any investment decision. But in the meantime, we're getting more -- we're getting prepared, working with communities, working with -- preparing for permitting and so forth. This will be a project the world will ultimately need going forward. We've got a neat project. It's not very big in Europe with our landing copper smelter, where we're going to be recycling electronic equipment. This responds to people wanting to see this sort of thing happening. It's a way of generating some copper without carbon emissions of significance investments. And so we're looking for that and looking at other opportunities like that. And then this reaching the air in Indonesia is really special. I was actually out there in the 90s when we were driving the drift, which was a de -watering drift going underneath the Grasberg open pit. As we drive in the pit, we found this ore body. The engineers give our geologists a hard time about it because they literally pierce this ore body that we're not seeing previously that lives really go south flank of the Grasberg pit. And we've been working on getting the right mine plan, the timing part. In the context of if you turn to slide 10, you can see where it's located. It's an ore body that's in a separate mineralization zone from our DOZ, and Grasberg pit. It's along fault line. It may have resources adept. It has some complicated geology and mineralogy, but this is a big mine. If 90,000 tons a day block cave, you only think of that. It is not being a huge mine because it's next the Grasberg Block Cave. But just like 60% size of Deep MLZ, 40% the size of Grasberg Block Cave, 350 million tons of ore, good copper and gold grades, 90,000 tons a day from a block cave. That's big by global standards. And it's going to occur over a number of years. It will help sustain our high level of low cost production out of Grasberg, 500 million pounds of copper a year, 500,000 ounces of gold, when it's ramped up in 2030. Capital expenditures going to be spent over a number of years. Use existing infrastructure. Just to ask your goal analysts, how they feel if gold Companies were to announce that gold mines was $500,000 a year in 500 million pounds of copper year. This is a significant opportunity for us. 12, I mentioned Lonestar. You can see how we're ramping up the oxides. We've got 2-3 reserves about 5.5 billion pounds. The real price here is sulfides underlying it. We've done some drilling to identify that we're doing preliminary plans and process it and so forth. Mineral potential is 50 billion pounds -- 50 billion pounds. This is a long-term opportunity, but we're a long-term Company. And this is going to be a flagship opportunity for us going forward. Another area that's emerging, and our guys in this call are really excited about it, is new opportunities to apply technology to leaching. Now, and Freeport predecessors were long leaders in leaching going back to the very start of SX - EW leaching. The opportunities globally for traditional SX - EW leaching are diminishing, because they've been accessed and taken advantage of it. But this opens up a whole new round of opportunities for us that had production with limited capital and low carbon emissions. This will range from looking at a series of additives and approaches for existing leached tax, which would allow us to recover more from those. We're also really getting excited by using these data analytics efforts that we started several years ago. To apply those to leach tax and know more about what we're doing, what the consequences are of taking certain actions. So it's a combination of things, there are several alternatives we're looking at. The opportunities are really significant. Our guys estimate we had almost 40 billion pounds of copper in our existing stock piles. This is not -- this has already been mined. It's mountain reserves and resources, and any production plant. If we can record -- if we're going to cover just a piece of this, it's a size of a new mine. Low capital, low operating costs, low carbon footprint. A lot of this is at Morenci, but there are other places. And it could even apply to some old historical mines that have old lead stacks that we can use it for. It's an emerging thing. But we are excited about it, and our Company's particularly well situated to take advantage of that because of the history that we've had with these older mines and what this could mean for it. So this is a stay tuned deal. We're not building in our plans yet. But just like a development project, low capital, low-cost, low carbon. So it's really good. So listen, we're just feeling great about Freeport. I mean, we just -- we've been to the awards together. Our team is -- we're adding some really new resources to our team despite COVID, we're bringing in support. We got young people in our organization stepping up to leadership positions. You know, it's a dynamic Company. It's remarkable that through all the trials and tribulations went through, we had very limited numbers of people to leave us. Our people look at each other and we're inspired by each other, and it's just great. Strong cash flows. We're going to be responsible. We have this great track record of doing all this. If you look at our success, we've had in developing projects all around the world, different kinds of mining, different kinds of processing technology. Market outlook is great, you got these organic growth opportunities. And really as a shareholder myself, the prospects of seeing returns on those shareholders coming of significance is just a great feeling. So I hope you can -- sense how we feel about our Company and our outlook, and really appreciate your interest. And I'm going to turn it over to Kathleen before we open up for questions. Kathleen Quirk : Great. Thank you, Richard. I'm just going to cover some brief comments on financial and operating matters and then we'll open up for questions. Starting on Slide 16, we provide some additional details on our operating activities. Richard mentioned Lonestar, and the performance there has been really strong. Our operations are exceeding our design capacity, which was originally 200 million pounds. We're exceeding that now by 25%, and we're continuing to optimize and planning for the next increment of production from Oxides as we study the longer-term opportunities. Richard mentioned the leach work that we're doing. It's a major focus at Morenci. We have a big effort underway to enhance recoveries and we're deploying a very -- a variety of initiatives. Some of these have already produced results. And that did enable us to increase expected recovery from some of our leach material in the third quarter. And what this does, is it gets us more volumes but also allows us to reduce unit costs, having a bigger pool to spread costs over. So that's a really positive thing and more to come there. We've incorporated some of this into our plans, but we're optimistic that additional copper pounds can be added as we go forward. At Morenci, we're continuing to work to increase mining rates. We're targeting getting up to 900,000 tons of material per day in 2023. That's a major undertaking. It's 30% higher than where we were in 2012. As we reported, we have started -- we started the historic Morenci Mill, which had been idled since the first half of 2020, and that's proceeding. We started the mill and the third quarter. We did experience some delays, but those are largely behind us. We also had as probably a lot of you've seen the the weather conditions in the Southwest that we experienced this summer. We did experience severe wet weather and some power issues during monsoon season, and we always have monsoon season. But this this year was more severe than normal and that did impact some of our operations in the third quarter. And again, that's behind us as well. I want to just echo what Richard said about our team in South America. The team has overcome significant challenges in dealing with the pandemic. We've been operating at about 95% of capacity over the last several months, and that's in the face of still restrictions on movement around and our team just does great work in managing this and being creative about how to manage it safely. We're optimistic that as we look forward into 2022, maybe the government restrictions can be lifted safely and we can return to a more normal operating environment there and achieve higher rates at Cerro Verde. El Abra mine in Chile is making great progress. We're increasing the stacking rate of material where we're storing production that we had curtailed during 2020. And we're focused on sustaining a level of production and elaborate in the 200-250 million pound per year range, as we look to potentially expand that as we go forward. Richard talked about the terrific results at Grasberg. Team there is just continuing to deliver results quarter-after-quarter. We expect to be at our quarterly run rate for metal beginning here in the fourth quarter. And for the next several quarters, we project the mill will run at about a 175,000 tons per day, until 2023, when we install the new SAG Mill, which is currently under construction. And that will support higher rates as we continue to ramp up the Grasberg Block Cave And the Deep MLZ and then make room for the Kucing Liar project that Richard mentioned. A lot of talk right now about inflation. Our team is really focused on cost management and efficiency projects. We're focused on extending equipment lines, ways to improve our energy efficiency, ways to efficiently implement maintenance practices and really use technology in all of this. We have like everyone else experienced some cost increases. Those have really principally been associated with the energy price increases. To a lesser extent, we've had some other impacts on our consumables, the impact of steel prices on some of our consumables. We've had higher sulfuric acid costs, freight costs. But we really want to send appreciation to our global supply chain team. They are doing excellent work in keeping our operations stocked with critical supplies and managing in these uncertain times. And they've just done an outstanding job in keeping our business business continuity going. I will note that we have seen very strong prices in Molybdenum and those have more than offset some of these inflationary pressures we've had on the cost side. Turning to the smelter. On Slide 17, we provide an update of our activities with the Greenfield smelter we're developing in and the work we're doing with our partner at PT Smelting to expand the facility there. We were focused on completing this project as efficiently, as timely as possible. We're advancing the engineering in commercial arrangements. And we've commenced preparing the land for construction. You probably have seen in press reports that the president of Indonesia recently visited the site in a groundbreaking ceremony. And that just indicates the significance of this project to the country. We've got a billion-dollar bank credit facility in place for PT-FI to use to advance the projects. And we are going to plan additional debt financing for the project, which can be obtained at attractive rates just on the project long term. As we previously discussed, the long-term costs for the financing for the smelter will essentially be offset by a phase out of the 5% export duty. So the economic impact to PT-FI is not material. And this is a project that is shared 51% by our shareholder of PT-FI, shareholder MIND ID in the balance of FCX. Turning to our volumes, and Richard talked about the growth in volumes, we've had great success and execution. We've got our three-year outlook listed on Slide 18. And this is generally consistent with our previous guidance. We made some relatively minor adjustments to the fourth quarter of 2021. But you'll see here that the execution of our plan is on track. We'll share one on Slide 19, the strong cash flow generation of this business. We've got very significant free cash flows using our volume and cost estimates and prices ranging from $4 to $5 copper. Holding gold flat at $1,800 and Molybdenum at current prices around $19 per pound. The real growth in our volumes with low incremental costs and show EBITDA ranging from $12.5 billion per annum on average for 2022 and 2023 at $4 copper and 17 billion if $5 copper as Richard has mentioned. And operating cash flows, and this is net of tax, ranges from $9 billion to over $12 billion, which provides significant cash flows not only to invest in our business and fund programs, grow our business, but also increase capital returns to investors. Our capital spending plans are detailed on the next slide, slide 20. You'll see here that we reduced our outlook for 2021 for capital spending from $2.2 billion previously to $2.2 billion and that excludes the smelter investment. But that reflects really timing. We've had really a timing issue in getting these projects going and so that would just -- some of that falling over into 2022. We've also added the -- in our forecast plans to commence development of the Kucing Liar ore body that Richard mentioned previously. So you're talking about $9 to $12 billion of operating cash flows and capex below $3 billion. Very strong free cash flow. We've got growing volumes, strong markets, low capital requirements. And that's really allowed us just over the past 12 months to reduce our debt, our net debt by nearly $6 billion. And so we're down now to $2 billion in net debt. I know some of you remember a time when it was multiples of this. And so we're in a great situation from a balance sheet standpoint. Our credit metrics are extremely strong and it positions us well as we go forward to invest in future growth and increase our payouts to shareholders. The last Slide 22, refers to our financial policy. It is centered around our strong balance sheet. The combination of the strong balance sheet and the success in growing our volumes will put us in a strong position. Our board had established earlier this year a policy that provides for up to 50% of free cash flow to be used for shareholder returns with the balance available for growth and further balance sheet improvements. With the achievement of our net debt targets, we look forward to the implementation of this policy. We expect our board will determine the structure and size of additional payouts to shareholders with our annual results. And this will be something that we update and it gets reviewed periodically. So that concludes our remarks. We look forward to reporting our progress and continuing to build on our momentum as we go forward. And operator, we'd now like to turn the call over for questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Michael Glick with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael Glick : Good morning. Just on the cost side, the trajectory in 4Q looks good as Grasberg ramps. But relative to the trajectory in 4Q and really into '22, how should we think about inflationary pressures given what's happened with coal in Indonesia, frayed power, particularly in Europe and Spain, diesel consumables and labor as well. And are there any annual contract resets we should be mindful of going into 2022? Kathleen Quirk : We've built into our projections current levels of energy costs. We do have a coal contract in Indonesia that is done annually. But for the most part, our energy costs are floating with the market. Because of the volume increase that we're expecting next year and that really we've got a big fixed cost business, so it comes at a low cost. We are projecting that our unit costs will decline year-on-year from '21 to '22, and we've got additional growth. So while costs inflation is a factor for us, it's being managed well and producing volumes at low incremental costs will help us drive costs lower in the place -- in the face of rising inflation. Michael Glick : Great. Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Yeah. Michael, I raised this question with our team getting ready for this because quite frankly when I saw the out years I was pleasantly surprised because of everything you're reading just generally about things. But you know, the currency rates are helping us and these background of credits or aren't really important to us. And of course in Indonesia, their gold is growing and Molybdenum is doing well. And our team has just done a great job in managing these things. We benefit because Freeport manages America's business as one business. We operate all the mines that we operate, and we have incredibly good relationships with suppliers. We're premium customer for all of our major suppliers. So some we're watching and we're -- some of our costs are correlated to copper prices. So it's a factor, but I was struck. I was expected to be more, quite frankly, myself. And it's turning out to be in our plans. Michael Glick : Awesome. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Emily Chang with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Emily Chang : Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. My question is just around capitals for tonnes. You clearly well below your net debt target here. But could you give us some color as to what's driving the hesitation around, maybe accelerating this announcement. Is it a macro uncertainty you talked a little bit about earlier or are we still balancing what the cadence of growth projects is in the next couple of years before announcing something positive then? Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Usually it's just more a question of how quickly this is developed. When we set the policy, we were anticipating meeting our debt target sometimes out in the future. And it happened so quickly. Business has gone so well. We've added new board members. And so we accept much earlier, a process that would result in this being addressed after the beginning of the year when we got our annual results. And so we'll be talking with our board about it. We are also having engagements with a number of our significant shareholders about stock buybacks and dividends. From the traditional thinking, it is seems to be shifting some. But it's nothing about reluctance about the future that's causing us to do that. And we have regular scheduled board meetings and we talk about it every board meeting. So it's just more of a question of how we set process early on. And clearly we're making progress much faster because of markets, but also because of our execution than we had anticipated. And so it's a good situation, but that's why we are where we are. Kathleen Quirk : And there's no hesitation, Emily, on this. We just got to implement it. Richard Adkerson : Yeah. Emily Chang : Appreciate and looking forward to it. Richard Adkerson : All of us are, Emily, but thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. David Gagliano : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Obviously a lot going on here. The leaching potential itself and opportunity, etc. I just wanted to focus in on Kucing Liar for a minute. In respect it's early days, but Kucing Liar obviously been a well-known part of the Grasberg district for a long time. Now that you're starting to develop it, I just have 2 questions. First of all, if you could talk about the cadence of the upcoming capital spending over the next 10 years. And then secondly, talk about the primary developmental risks as you see it today. Again, I know it's early days that you referenced complicated geology, mineralogy, what are in your view, the primary developmental its challenges for Kucing Liar? That's it for me. Kathleen Quirk : David, on the capex, like our rather Block caves, is spread out over a long period of time. So it'll start out next year somewhere in the and so that's done over approximate 10-year period. And the production will come on to seek when that all this is sequenced together, but the production will come on to sequence when we have availability in the mill, as we have some declines with other ore bodies. But Mark, if you want to give some background about KL. As Richard was saying, this is just a natural progression for us. It gives us really a place to continue to use all, everything we learned from Deep MLZ and Grasberg Block Cave to extend that to KL. And so we're -- we think it's a natural time to begin transitioning to develop another ore body there. Mark Johnson : Yeah. And David, it's going to look very much like Deep MLZ instead of similar elevation. It is going to benefit from the lessons learned at Deep MLZ, for instance, our plans now would be that we would apply this hydrofracking technology to it in advance. Where with Deep MLZ, we ended up having to play a bit of catch-up. So we've got a much better geotechnical knowledge and how to address that part of the risks. It does with Kathleen says it benefits. It, ties in development, some of the infrastructure it shares. There's common parts of the ore flow system, ventilation access we're driving three headings, starting very soon. And they all tie off of the development that's either off of the big DAS or off of drifting that goes back to GBC. The previous KL reserve had much more complex metallurgy and geology. Over the last couple of years, we changed our mine planning approached, we focused on what turned out to be much higher value material that was a little bit lower grade, but the material could be processed through our current mill. So that took away a lot balances that the previous kale mine plant had. We had to change our flotation circuit. We have much more of the environmental management with pyrite concentrate that would be generated. So this plan, it's above 0.9 Copper, 0.9 per ton gold. The times that Richard mentioned are very much driven by this 2041 dates that we're working on. And this deposit has a lot of growth, both on the same footprint that we're working out now and at deeper levels. So I feel like this is going to be our chance to take all the lessons learned. We're looking at the potential of applying electrical -- electric mining equipment there. So I think we get a fresh start with a lot of experience that's going to apply itself. And KL is going to benefit from it. Richard Adkerson : I want to tell you today that when Mark -- the original reserve, as Mark said, had all this material and our gold recovers are very low and processing is complicated. And dealing with the Pyrite tails was real complicated. I was just so impressed with Mark and his mine planning team came in with this new plan, which makes it much more traditional, much less risky, much less capital intensive, and in fact, created more value. Because originally we were only getting 50% recovery out of that pyrite laden gold and ore. So it's a great example of having really good mine planning theme and lead by mark. David Gagliano : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Just a quick follow-up on the time of the CapEx. So 4 billion over roughly 10 years, 200 million in 2022, is the lion's share of the spend likely towards the latter half of the decade? Is that reasonable to say? Can you give us a little more color on the timing of that ramp? Kathleen Quirk : It'll average around that. Richard Adkerson : It's pretty consistent. Because we develop most of the access and ventilation and all those sorts of things, it's not chunky. This is -- David Gagliano : Okay. Richard Adkerson : -- more or less mine development. And that occurs on a regular pattern. David Gagliano : Okay. Understood. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Your line is open. Chris La Femina : Hi, Richard, hi Kathleen, How are you? Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, Chris. great. Chris La Femina : Just a follow-up question on the KL project? It sounds like the gold grades there are quite a bit higher than they are at the Grasberg Block Cave, and the DMLZ, and the copper grades are similar. So is this a project where we should expect operating costs to be at least as well, if not lower than what you're going to get from the two current Block Cave projects? And secondly -- Richard Adkerson : The answer -- the answer is yes. Chris La Femina : Certainly lower cost. And what should we also think about it as just being sort of a mine life extension to the Grasberg Block Cave or is it would it be a period where you have I mean, you obviously constrained by the mill capacity, but would you be a period where you might have higher production as this is online along with you still operating the Block -- the Grasberg Block Cave. Richard Adkerson : It just fits in really well with great changes with our existing mines. It just folds right in. It's a sustainability of production projects as opposed to a significant growth project. Mark Johnson : And one thing I might add to it is with the SEK3 projects, we get up to a mill capacity of 240, that milligrand, somewhere around 220. So scale benefits somewhat off the mill capacity that they provide. And then as Richard and Kathleen mentioned, it just fits in nicely as the grades and some of the deposits thing to decline, kale comes up. And so we're able to adjust those other mine plans and room for kale to be that 90,000 ton producer. And want the grades at are better than the grades, for instance, at Deep MLZ. Richard Adkerson : And Chris, to put that in perspective, way back in the 1990s when we were designing the Grasberg open pit and looking forward to life beyond the pit, our original targets was a 120,000 tons states we can mill. So over time, this amazing ore body is allowing us to go from anticipated a 120,000 ton per day mill rate from the underground to 240,000 tons from the underground. Just to put it in perspective. Chris La Femina : And sorry, if I could a second question regarding your projects. It's really actually incredible when you think about over the last five years you went from being in a position where you were kind of managing the balance sheet, trying to develop these two really difficult underground projects in Indonesia, negotiating with the government regarding ownership at Grasberg. And you probably couldn't have drawn it up any better as to how it's progressed in terms of development of the projects, the deleveraging of the balance sheet, the ramp up of the Grasberg Block Cave in DMLZ has been really impressive. I think there was a lot of skepticism in the market about whether you can actually deliver on that, and it seems like you are delivering. But now you are kind of unleashing this massive organic growth pipeline, which is probably underappreciated until recently. I mean, you've kind of been highlighting in recent quarters, but now we're there. So you're going to be developing these projects and you're obviously talking as well about this kind of catalytic leaching and leaching thread of old leach stacks, power doors which historically have not been commercial. Is this a technology that you think could potentially be revolutionary in the industry in terms of leading to a lot of supply growth from old what had been leach stockpiles? Do we have to worry about the copper supply demand balance as a result of these sorts of new technologies leading to lots of growth? Richard Adkerson : That's again, Chris, question I've been asking our team all along. In a prior life, I actually worked with the first Company out in Houston that is a very first fracking operations for the whole oil and gas industry way back in 80s. And so I've asked that question. And while it's a tremendous opportunity and particularly good for our Company considering the nature of our stockpiles and the history of our operations in the way we've dealt with low grade, this will be beneficial. People are really going to be pursuing it. There are -- is not just one technology is being pursued, but a series of different options. So it's an evolving story. It's not likely to be the account of game changer that fracking was in the oil and gas business. Chris La Femina : That's great. Thank you for that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lawson Winder from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open. Lawson Winder : Hi, good morning and thank you for the update. It's nice to hear from both of you. There's so much to discuss, but I'd like to actually touch on your efforts around ESG, particularly in Indonesia. I mean, it's really exciting that you're targeting a certain percent reduction in emissions by 2030. And I was wondering, how do you think about the cost of that? Or what is the cost that you've factored in order to achieve that? And then when you think about it, maybe some of the other way in terms of IRR, if you assume some carbon pricing assumption around where maybe European coke prices today, but what kind of IRR can you get on those types of investments? Thank you. Richard Adkerson : So that -- I kind of hate people who say that's a good question. And some people will say it all the time, but that is real good question. And it's something that is really underappreciated right now. And we're particularly focused on it within ICMM, because here we had the 28 largest mining companies, we represent about a third of the global mining industry, unanimously, making this commitment. And as I said, with Freeport, because of our limited scope, three emissions, it's not as big a challenge as it is for some other miners and resource companies. But we don't know yet what the cost of this is going to be. And it's going to be significant. There's just no way around it. Met with senior management caterpillar and to try to think about designing 400 ton haul trucks, we can make the grades of these big pits that we have. The battery in those, at this current level of technology is changing, but then battery weighs a time. It's life is very short, so you've got to deal with all the recharging and trying systems and so forth. So there are lots of unknowns here. There's no question it's going to involve a lot of costs. And right now, while people are really making these commitments in good faith, they're doing it at a time, and we talked about this in our climate report, of where it's going to rely on technology advances and some of those things there's more questions than answers and with all that right now. We have a good -- I think we've got our arms around converting the Coal Plant in Indonesia, and that's one of our big things. But the questions is how do you deal with halogen electrifying shovels and -- I know our shovels are already electric, but just light vehicles and so forth. In our underground mines, we have a big electric train helping us deliver ore, but there would have to be some investments there. So it's going to be an unfolding story and you raised the point that people following us and companies in our industry ought to really be tracking. Because as we sit here today, there's more questions than answers in that area. I just want to add on to that. That's going to be another factor. That's going to be a barrier to supply development in the copper business. I mean, low grade end-of-life mines -- And we got 30 years or so to have this on wine. But it's going to affect mine life. It's going to affect the economics of project development. All of those things are going to come into play. So in your list of items that are are barriers to supply development, this is a factor that you can add to it. Lawson Winder : Very fair. Kathleen Quirk : One of the other things to keep in mind in Indonesia is we have -- with the transition to underground when we were mining and at the surface, we had to move both ore and waste to get the metal production here on the ground. It's very efficient. You're with the block-caving and you really just mining ore and so it is more efficient. As Richard said, we've got some electrical applications underground. Mark talked about expanding that as we as we look at new developments in KL. So there are some benefits that we have in Indonesia from the change from surface mining to our underground mining. Richard Adkerson : Yeah. We were moving 800 thousand to a million metric tones a day in that open pit mine. Think about that. We still don't have to move material around to manage waste and deal with our tailing system and so forth. But that's a big change. But we've got plans in developing new mines in the world. This is kind of a conundrum. The world needs more copper and yet more copper until technology breaks through, is going to result in more carbon emissions. And this is not the only industry where that's an issue that's unknown right now. But it's certainly true in our industry. Lawson Winder : Thank you for your thoughts. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw from Scotia Bank. Your line is now open. Orest Wowkodaw : Yes. Good morning. I was wondering if you can get some details on the potential timeline for the Baghdad concentrator expansion. How much time's involved for permitting something like that. And even with the Lonestar expansion, is it fair to say that probably we wouldn't see any capex for either in 2022? Richard Adkerson : Well, I'll let others answer. We will have capex for Lonestar with this oxide, cause we're expanding to oxide. We started out at a certain level and we're stepping it up. But Kathleen, you were are calling somebody? Kathleen Quirk : It will be a small amount of capital in 2022. And at Baghdad, we're really jsut advancing feasibility next year. We're thinking Baghdad is probably still five years out or so before we will have production. And so you won't have meaningful capex for another couple of years associated with it. And Lone Star, the next increment of expansion is relatively low in terms of capital intensity. The longer-term opportunity is more 20, 30 type, but it's meaningful. The big thing that we really were focused on is growth through these low capital intensive opportunities to get more out of what we already have, either through automation or this leach technologies that we're pursuing. And so that's really where we can impact things in the short-term. Richard Adkerson : I'm going to put an exclamation point to what Kathleen just said about Baghdad. Because going back to the early 2000, there was just a feeling that higher prices would bring production. I mean that's been the history of the copper industry. But here we are at Baghdad where we already have the reserves. We have established operations, full support of the community, and we're just talking about shortening the reserve life by building a new concentrate. And that's five years out. That's as a easy a project as you're going to find in this industry. So that's what I was just saying. This coming situation, absent some doomsday global economic situation, there's just going to be a time when the world is going to be very short of copper. Orest Wowkodaw : I couldn't agree more. Richard, just as a quick follow-up. In terms of the capital allocation framework of paying out up to 50% of the effectively free cash flow. How does the smelter CapEx fit into that? Is that excluded from the formula or included? Richard Adkerson : It's excluded. And you need to keep that in mind because that is a PT-FI project. It's good. That was one of the goals I was trying to achieve when we were negotiating all of this back in 2018, is we consolidate PT-FI. The economics of -- and so that will show up as consolidated debt for us. But if it's financed at the subsidiary level, the obligation is going to be shared by the 2 shareholders; FCX and MIND ID. It will go into PT-FI's tax calculations. So the project will be something that will affect PT-FI 's taxes. When you step back from that Indonesian operations, I would really please -- I don't know if any of you review the Indonesia media coverage, but they just had these athletic games in Papua, where the president was there and senior government people. They had the ground breaking. I have never in 30 years seeing such positive comments in the media in Indonesia about Freeport, as we saw with this. And the president is recognizing what a great investment country made when they bought out Rio Tinto's joint venture interest in 2018. We've already started paying dividends. The dividends are going to be really spectacular for the government going forward. And when you look at the government's equity position, their 51% share of equity, which will step up to that in stages. You look at the tax rate, we have royalties, we pay. You look at the payments that are made for inter-Company transfers to FCX. The government's economic interest in the project. We exceed 70%. We were able to retain through the negotiations, the interest we had going into it. So this is truly something that all the parties are very happy with. And what a release it is to be working in Indonesia and not have to deal with the kind of complications we had for so many years. Orest Wowkodaw : Thanks, Richard. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Carlos with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open Carlos De Alba : Yes.Thank you very much. Good morning. Richard and Kathleen. Just on KL. How much, if anything, of the estimated 500 million pounds of copper at KL would be incremental. Or a 100% would be just you to replace a sustained and new production profile in Indonesia? And together with that and just following on the discussion that we just had on the prior question, how do you envision Richard arising on the negotiating a table for the potential extension of your rights in Indonesia. Would the government potentially get a higher stake in Indonesia? Or what is the scope of the negotiation. Richard Adkerson : So with your first question, Kathleen help me. Well, let me just say though. We give a five-year outlook for PT-FI's production. And is that in the press release or was that -- Kathleen Quirk : Yeah. Richard Adkerson : Okay. So Carlos, just follow that and you can see that is we said before, this is more of a question of sustaining production levels as opposed to a growth project. But you can see what we show for five years, and that will give you a view of the trend going forward. Now, with respect to your second question, it's really early stages. But we have broached it. I've talked with senior government people about it, and our partner MIND ID, the state-owned Company under the auspices of the minister state of enterprises, everybody recognizes the mutual benefits. For sure the government like a bigger interest. But think about the complications of that because with an extension, we will want to start, as Mark said, we've got opportunities to KL and elsewhere to invest and we will make those investments in advance of 2041. And so we have to balance out how you share those costs, where we basically have 50% economics of new investment, with what's our interest going to be going forward. So that's early days to be discussed. Tried to raise it earlier, but it was just not possible to get traction on those discussions. But the logic and benefits to all stakeholders for finding a way forward on this are clear cut. Carlos De Alba : I understand. Richard Adkerson : The alignment between FCX and the government is really good. To have the kind of incentives for both parties to have a win-win, that's what really we tried to design in 2018. And that's really what's happened. Carlos De Alba : Given everything that goes around developing a project of this magnitude, KL, what will be ideally the expansion of the time for those either you were looking for 20, 30 years or something around those lines? Kathleen Quirk : Well, just to be clear on KL -- Richard Adkerson : To be clear on KL -- yeah, Kathleen. Those economics are baked into 2041? Carlos De Alba : Okay. Richard Adkerson : So they're not dependent on extension. What the opportunity is is to make the KL bigger and to find other resources because we really have done very limited delineation type exploration work in a number of years. And so we don't know the answers, but we're optimistic that there's resources there that we don't know about yet. And the best answer is for projects like this to not have a time frame, but to have incentives for all the parties to work to maximize the resources over the long term. Time frames make no sense. Carlos De Alba : Thank you very much. Richard Adkerson : But I want to be clear. The KL economics are not dependent on an extension -- the current project. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian McArthur with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Brian Mc Arthur : Hi, good morning. Well, Richard, you just answered the question I had right there, so they don't try something else. Just on the Molybdenum business, obviously, doing a lot better. I see climax has come up a little bit. Like what's the strategy going forward, but like you plan to reference up more there and at Sierrita, which obviously has a big Molly credit. Why wouldn't it get fully ramped up bigger in the whole thing in the near-term too? Richard Adkerson : Well, we benefited at Freeport because there's some very significant investments in that Molybdenum business prior to our acquisition of Phelps Dodge. And then creating the processing facilities capabilities -- And Mike Kendrick is on the line. He can chip in on this, but rather than just being a metal producer and a byproduct producer, the past efforts created a really sustainable in this global leading business of where we're able to maximize the value of our ore resources in Colorado from our Molybdenum mines through the bi-product credits in North America and South America. And we can expect those to come with expansion projects and more. And so we were able to generate higher than the metal price value for Molybdenum back processing as a chemical products. And we run this thing as a business. It obviously ebbs and flows with the price of Molybdenum. Today's price look out 3 or 4 years and a lot of cash coming out of that business. But it's strategically important to us. We just got a great team. It's a global team. They work together very well. Colorado is a state where you've got -- all states are, but you got to be very careful about environmental management. City of Denver gets maybe 10% of its drinking water off the Climax mountain. And so it's a business that goes back 100 years, more than a 100 years for our predecessors and is strategically very important. And now, it's generating cash. Mike, you want to add anything? Kathleen Quirk : I'm going, Richard. Brian, we do have opportunities to increase primary Molly production at the Climax mine. If you think about what the big deficits people are talking about in copper, there could be mounting deficits in Mali at some point. And so we want to be in a position -- and that's what our primary mines can do, is It's need market demand. And we've got -- we had curtailed capacity in the past to match up with markets. And now we have the opportunity potentially to increase. And so we're going to be doing some mine stripping and that sort of thing to be positioned so that the markets are there, we can be there to participate with this quality product that the market wants. So we're looking at all of that, and Mike, if you want to add something to that. Mike Kendrick : No, I think you both have captured it really well, is that we've made -- three quarters made tremendous investments in the molly business over the last decade, including the Climax Mine, tremendously productive circuit at Cerro Verde and at our other by-products circuits in North America. And we've been able to take that with our downstream operations that we've inherited. And we've made incremental investments over time there, and they are very productive. And we can service not only the metallurgical, but the chemical industry and the lubricant industry very well. And as Kathleen says, we're definitely evaluating the next steps. Brian Mc Arthur : And sorry, just on Sierrita, given the big molly credit there, is that all the way back to full capacity yet? Richard Adkerson : Josh? Josh Olmsted : Yeah. Good morning. I was going to jump in with respect to Sierrita. So they've been -- we've been ramping back up at Sierrita in terms of the mine plan and stripping over the last 6 to 8 months. And so if you think about it from a molly perspective, it's really been driven by the sequencing and the great available in the mine. And so as the molly price has gone up, we're looking at what's the best way to optimize the value at Sierrita. But the upside is incremental. It's not significant because the mill is at its capacity as we sit today and going forward. There's opportunities, as Kathleen touched on earlier, with respect to incremental billing rate increases, which we're working on through the data analytics and digital type tools. But it will be incremental at best as we go forward. Brian Mc Arthur : Thank you very much. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, Brian. Richard Adkerson : Thanks, Brian. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking from Citi. Alex Hacking : And thanks Mike. Mike question was already answered, which was around the economics of KL. If the contract of work is not extended beyond 2041, but you were very clear that the economics work in that scenario. So I will let someone ask the last question. Thanks. Richard Adkerson : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Michael Dudas : Michael. Good morning, Richard, Kathleen. Great, great news on the relationship with the Indonesian Government.Maybe you could share some additional thoughts on what you're observing in Peru with the new administration. What's coming up in Chile in the fall on elections. And is there anything out of Washington with all the noise that's going to could impact mining, could impact potential investment or how the mining industry will react as some of this legislation comes forward? Richard Adkerson : Well, I got to discipline my comments with those questions. Michael Dudas : I'm sorry about that, Richard. Richard Adkerson : The world we live in. Chile is separate from Peru. And it's got a really, a lot of questions about it right now. It's driven by this wide spread feeling within the country of people as things were happening around the world dealing with income inequalities and social programs versus other government initiatives and so forth. And it's got a complicated election coming up. There's no clear-cut front runner right now. There's processes going on within the parliament within issues related to consideration of constitutional changes. And so it's really, from my perspective, muddy waters there. It's not chronically nearly as significant as Peru in terms of El Abra 's production is a small part of our production, but it is affecting our consideration of expansion. But we're working with the industry. We're not we're -- not top of the charts in terms of production there, so we're working with others on it. In Peru, Peru always, consistently has complicated presidential politics. And we've seen this story before, where a less leaning candidate gets into office and runs on platforms that are very much addressing -- getting more money out of mining companies. And President Castillo ran on that platform. He had the backing of the far left wing parties there. I've got to meet him within this past month. He came to Washington. It was a Sunday before and with a small group of mining executives, had dinner with him. And my first time to meeting -- he comes from a nonpolitical leader background. He was a teacher in the interior for Peru. And when he talked to the set and I, I found him to be very compelling in his emotional feelings about doing more to help the people from the region where he came from but also throughout Peru. The poor people in terms of education and so forth. And I didn't know what to expect when I went there. I had better feeling than I had going into it. He listened. I had the chance to have exchanges about different issues. None of us got into details about specific fiscal proposals and so forth. But he emphasized that he recognized the importance of mining place in Peru. And that's what always happens when people get an office to achieve social programs. They see how much mining contributes to the country financially. And that's needed to do other things. So I'm having a lot of conversations with other CEOs of countries that operate in Peru. After that meeting, he revamped his cabinet at the very upset of this administration and replaced a very aggressive guy that was prime minister. And so it's really wait and see thing, but I'm more encouraged about it. We're working with others in the industry. We need to be responsive. Here's concerns, and that's what I'm trying to. We focus all of our -- almost all of our community programs on the regions where we operate. I think we've got to take a broader view and show people in the interior that mining can help their lives. And so that's what I'm working on right now. And so I am more optimistic now than I was during the election. You'll hear different views by different miners there. People are very concerned, rightly so. Our situation is we have a new stability agreement. We're maximizing the operations at Cerro Verde. It's a big producer. A major contributor to our volumes. It's got the world's largest mine site, concentrate facilities. We have great relationships with the local community. So we want to build off that and try to reach out and find some common ground work for President Castillo. But it's uncertain. Man, what about the U.S? What can you say? I mean, It's just a head scratcher about what also is going on in Washington these days. The current administration recognizes the importance of minerals like copper to achieve their goals of climate change, And yet, I don't expect them to lessen up any requirements for permitting environmental management community issues runs against their political situation. So it's really uncertain. We're all hopeful we'll see some steps towards infrastructure building. The country really needs it. You see it in ports and roads, and bridges all over the country. But I just don't have any comment on the political situation other than be distressed about it. And we also need to have a more thoughtful approach to relationships with China in this country. And that's a byproduct parties and issue and it's a complicated one. But China is going to be important part of our world going forward and the country is too big and people are very smart. They work hard and they create a lot of economic loss of these. So anyway, I'm focused staying out of politics and focused on Freeport. Michael Dudas : You sound like a true ambassador, Richard, thank you. Kathleen Quirk : He's right. Operator : Thank you. And Now we'll turn the call over to management for any closing remarks. Richard Adkerson : Well Kathleen, I thought, going into this thing, we had such a good quarter, we'd have a real short call, but I really appreciate your good questions. As always, there a lot of complicated issues to face with -- I woke up this morning, feeling on top of the world and then I opened my screen to see for the first in a number of days, a weekday in the market and I said, that was just God's way of reminding me about the business for him. But we couldn't be more po -- I think you get -- I hope you get the sense, not just for me, but from our whole team of just how good we feel about what we've done. And we're not going to focus on what we've done. We're focusing on where we go from here. And it's a long-range business. This is a long range Company. We don't feel any pressure to do -- to do anything from any kind of M&A standpoint, the overly aggressive and new investment decisions. We're going to approach this in a very straightforward, logical way. And in the meantime, make a lot of money and show shareholders some gratitude for sticking with us and being part of our Company. So thank you all. If you have follow-up questions, as always, let me and David know, and we will be responsive. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead ma'am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport McMoran conference call. Earlier this morning we reported our fourth quarter and year-end 2021 operating and financial results and a copy of today's press release and slides are available on our website at FCX.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin today's comments, we'd like to remind everyone that our press release and certain of our comments on today's call include forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. On the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Johnson, who heads up our Indonesian Operations; Josh Olmsted, who heads up our Americas Business; Mike Kendrick, who leads Molybdenum business; we\u2019ve also have Rick Coleman and Cory Stevens, who support our team with engineering and construction, technical services and support for our growth projects; and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. I'll start by briefly summarizing our financial results, and then I'll turn over the call to Richard who'll review the slide materials on our -- in our presentation. And I'll make some comments, and then we'll open up the call for questions. Today, FCX reported fourth quarter 2021 net income attributable to common stock of $1.1 billion or $0.74 per share, and adjusted net income after excluding net charges totaling $0.3 billion or $0.21 per share was $1.4 billion or $0.96 per share for the quarter. For the year ended 2021, our net income attributable to common stock totaled $4.3 billion, $2.90 per share, and adjusted net income totaled $4.6 billion or $3.13 per share. We have a reconciliation of our adjusted net income on VII in as part of today's release. Our adjusted earnings before interest taxes and depreciation for the fourth quarter totaled $3.2 billion and for the year totaled $10.9 billion. We've got a reconciliation of our EBITDA calculations on Page 43 of our presentation materials. Our team delivered great volume growth during the year, our copper sales of over a billion pounds during the fourth quarter, approximated our guidance going into the period. And for the year we sold 3.8 billion pounds of copper that was a 19% increase from 2020. Our fourth quarter 2021 gold sales of 395,000 ounces or about 5% above our guidance went into the quarter. And that reflected higher throughput rates in Indonesia. Our annual gold sales totaled 1.4 million ounces for the year and were 59% above the 2020 total. We benefited during the quarter from positive pricing for copper. Our average realized price of $4.42 per pound in the fourth quarter was more than $1 per pound higher than the fourth quarter of 2020. Our realized gold price of $1,808 per ounce was slightly below the year-ago quarter. And our results also benefited from improved molybdenum prices, our realization in the fourth quarter of 2021 of over $19 per pound was almost double the year-ago periods realization. Unit net cash costs during the fourth quarter averaged $1.29 per pound of copper. That was slightly above our estimate of $1.26 going into the quarter, but that reflected a charge -- a non-recurring charge associated with the successful completion of our multi-year collective labor agreements at Cerro Verde in Peru. Strong cash flow generation again during the quarter, we generated $2.3 billion of operating cash flows. And for the year we generated $7.7 billion of operating cash flow, and that exceeded our capital spending of $2.1 billion for the year. As you saw in November of 2021, our board approved a new share purchase program, authorizing purchases of up to $3 billion of FCX common stock. Through January 25, we acquired 15.4 million shares at a total cost of $600 million and that was an average price of $39 per share. The board also approved in November, an increase in common stock dividends for 2022, effectively doubling our common stock dividend. And on December 22, we declared dividends totaling $0.15 per share that will be paid on February 1 of this year to shareholders of record as of January 14. Our balance sheet is strong. You'll see that in the results. The net debt at the end of the year, totaled $1.4 billion. And we had no borrowings under our $3.5 billion revolver. So we've got strong liquidity with $8 billion of cash at the end of 2021. I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard who'll be referring to our presentation materials on our website. Richard Adkerson : Thanks, Kathleen. And hello everyone. The end of 2021 is a special time for our Freeport team. We've met a series of multi-year complex challenges with great success. You start by looking at the debt picture, which Kathleen mentioned, just six years ago, our debt was a $20 billion, and the way to manage it was really unclear. We have now reached the point where our debt is de minimis. We have started a program of shareholder returns with higher dividends and share buybacks. We have assets in our outlook that will allow us to increase those over time. Our credit rating has been raised to investment grades by two of the agencies. Then you look at the Grasberg underground project, which goes back much further. We begin our initial plans for this underground operation in the mid-1990s. We began spending capital 20 years ago. By the end of the year, we met our target by reaching our metal long-term run rate. We are taking steps successfully and have the way forward to increase our mining rate to well over 200,000 tonnes per day from the underground that's just remarkable. During this period of ramping up Grasberg, we had challenges in our dealings with Indonesian government about our contract of work. We resolved those three years ago. And I'm pleased to report that our relationships with the government of Indonesia is one now cooperation, working together mutually for common goals. Relationships have never been better. Then two years ago, we started facing COVID. That was a huge uncertainty for us. At the time, we took aggressive steps to be prepared to manage the risks that were emerging. We've successfully managed our way through that and achieved our debt reduction Grasberg underground from that standpoint. ESG is on everybody's mind these days. It's always been part of our psyche at Freeport, because of the nature of operations that we've begun aggressive efforts to deal with climate change, impacts of our operations. We're working with the copper industry with this copper mark designation, which we have been a leader and working with ICMM with communities. I became Chairman about a year ago, I made commitments to myself to strengthen Freeport's board. This year, we've added six new directors for our well-known highly regarded CEOs with extensive international business experience who add a lot to our board. We have two women, we added that both our financial experts, experienced in audit committee dealings, one is proudly is an Hispanic. It's just been a great work by our team, we have a real sense of accomplishment. And we're really looking forward now to the future with optimism, commitment and excitement. Turning to our results, our copper volumes grew by 19% compared with the prior year, reflecting this ramp up in Indonesia. Our unit costs decline despite rising energy costs in other unit and other input cost. Our team's done a great job of managing the challenges of supply chain and cost inflation. We generate strong margins. Our EBITDA and cash flow rose by 2.5x over 2020. And we ended the year with just over $1 billion in net debt. And we're well prepared with our long live reserve and resource base to advance organic growth over time. Now with the ramp up at Grasberg reaching the point of where it is. We're now looking to our operations in the Americas for future growth. It's nice to talk about accomplishments, but we're all focused on what we go, where we go from here. How we build more value for our company. And we have a great opportunity to do that. Copper, over 20 years ago, our company made a commitment to copper and it was driven by a supply side constraints that we saw in the global marketplace, at that time growth in China. And we have fundamentally stuck with that. We -- our board made a diversion with this oil and gas deal, but that's behind us now. But the fundamental outlook for copper as positive as it was 20 years ago, is now even more positive and it becoming increasingly positive, it is driven by coppers role in the global economy, just fundamentally the need for copper and as the world develops, so that in China. China continues to be an important part of the market. Global growth will occur outside China. But the new elements of demand are really significant. Any investments in carbon reduction and everyone's talking about carbon reduction, require significantly more copper than then the world is required in the past. Electrification is the key to climate change. And two-third to three quarters of coppers use is dealt with electrification, whether it's electric vehicles, alternative energy generations, all of these require much more copper than the traditional power. Then you look beyond that to technology advances in communication is artificial intelligence. Expanding connectivity is infrastructure is developed around the world public health initiatives. All of these are creating what I'm calling a new era of copper demand. And these are broad based. They're inevitable. Copper will be affected by risk to the global economy from time-to-time. But underlying that is a long-term, very positive outlook for copper. And our company is solidly positioned to benefit from that. If you add that together with supply and scarcity and the demand factors, and you have a real compelling case for investing in our company. We're seeing increasing scarcity in supply, at a time when demand is growing so significantly. There are a limited number of projects, which have been under development for some time now that are scheduled to come on stream in the near-term. But when you look beyond that, it's hard to find actionable projects that are can be developed within a very short period of time. It just takes a long time. And then there's increasing political risk around the world that will have its impact on copper supply development. Notably in Chile and Peru, where 40% of the world's copper comes from, there's new President who run on agendas that are oriented towards social programs that require more revenues to implement and how the industry and the governments deal with that will be very important. But beyond that, you see this in countries like the United States, you see others countries restricting new supply development for community social issues. Countries around the world are demanding more of miners in terms of revenues that goes beyond Chile and Peru, ranging all the ways from Asia to Central America to Africa. All of these things add into supply constraints at a time when the world needs more copper. We're focused on the long-term outlook for our markets. We always prepare ourselves and recognize that near-term risk may emerge to the global economy. Now we're strong financially to deal with those risk. We structured our business in a way that we have flexibility to manage it, so we're much more comfortable today about whether our company is positioned to take advantage for what we believe will be a very positive view for copper as a commodity. If you look at our reserve base, the report reserves this year, based on mine plans of $2.50 copper. We don't limit ourselves to looking at projects on that basis, because we have an optimistic view about copper that we have a more than $2.50 copper, we have more than a 25 year reserve life approved in probable reserves. And beyond that in our incremental mineral resources, we have enormous amounts of copper that over time will be brought into reserves as we doing Asian drilling and engineering work that you bring those into reserves and up with the new projects. This is really a key asset for Freeport. It provides us a lot of options for the future. When you look at the scarcity in the industry for development opportunities. Report does not need to rely on acquisitions to support our long-term future. We always monitor opportunities, but we have the assets within our company and how to sustain our business in growing significantly over time. With these favorable markets, our margins and cash flows are growing. We have well established plans. Our whole team globally is focused on executing plans to produce more copper, produce it at a lower cost. We built a strong foundation for the future. We had significant sales increase in 2021 that growth factored in. For the near-term. There's no 13% in 2022 improving in 2023. We have the risk in our plans, expect growing margins and are really prepared to execute to generate the cash to support returns to shareholders as we invest in future growth. Looking at the slide now, now that shows the successful ramp up of the Grasberg in underground. I just wish you all had seen him, because I got a big smile on my face. When I look at this. It's really significant with what we've done there. Our team there is just really to be complimented. Meeting all these challenges. It's not -- was not to ensure of a monumental task. As I mentioned earlier, it was years to achieve this. The underground development. Turning to the next slide, over 350 miles of tunnels seven miles of an underground railroad with tea and electric trains running for huge crushers, five miles of conveyor belts, these shafts to take large numbers of people down underground. It's all underground, over 500 drawbells have been open, almost 350,000 meters of undercut. And we're really on track to achieve long-term sustainable rates of in excess of 200,000 tonnes a day from our mines through our mills. This gives us a very strong base of long-term, we've done this now to create return Grasberg to be the second largest copper mine in the world, the largest single gold mine even though it's a byproduct, look at it fourth quarter when we had our net cash costs in the face of all this inflation of only $0.08 per pound for the second largest copper mine in the world. We achieve long-term run rate of 1.6 billion pounds of copper a year, over 750,000 tonnes. All this looks simple on paper, but man it was a challenge to get it done and our team deserves a tremendous amount of credit for doing this. Now we look at where are we going to grow for the future? How are we going to sustain our business for the future? This new lease technologies that we're working in the Americas is a huge opportunity for Freeport. Our company historically was a leader in developing leaching. Our Morenci Mine in Arizona is the world's largest leaching operation in today's global copper market. And this technology that we will have to improve recoveries and achieve recoveries from historical waste stacks is creating copper that no one thought we had the opportunity to recover is really significant for us. Then we have our mine in Northwestern Arizona, the Bagdad mine which has a long reserve life, set up perfectly for mill expansions and to achieve greater volumes out of it in a relatively straightforward way. In Eastern Arizona, we have the Lone Star mine, which I truly believe someday will be the All Star Mine for Freeport, we're working in expanding recoveries from the oxide ore that is there, taking advantage of facilities that are nearby us, Safford mine, which is where production is declining, as planned. But underneath that the Lone Star mine has a sulfide resource that I really believe will make it be the All Star Mine for us. The project in Chile that the world will need we're waiting to see how things unfold there. And then this Kucing Liar mine that we have undeveloped at Grasberg is going to be an important part of our future there. This will be one of the world's largest Block Cave mines in its own way 80,000 tonnes a day. It's got resource of six billion pounds of copper, five million ounces of gold for 2041. We're talking with the government now with preliminarily about rights beyond that, and that mine will be producing well below 2041. Well, that's on stream, we are targeting getting up to 240,000 tonnes a day of mine rate, mill rate out of the operations Grasberg. There's a slide on Lone Star that I referred to earlier, you can see the data how we are increasing it, but the real there, the oxide development will be profitable at the volumes attractive cost. But the real long-term price there is this sulfide resource and underlies the oxide. It's very large, it take time to do it. But it'll have a complex we believe ultimately similar to the Morenci mine, which is the largest mine in North America. Now, this unique technology is something you'll hear a lot about from us, throughout the energy industry. We will be a leader here, we are looking at several different types of technologies. All of them are excited, Cory is leading our team here. And it's really a new element of demand just in our existing waste stacks. We have, we believe we have almost 40 billion pounds of copper in those stacks. And even small recoveries out of that could result in copper, that would be equivalent to developing a whole new mine. So it's early stage technology, lot of work to do, a lot of excitement by our team about doing this. So it's really good. I want to close by just recognizing our team around the world. I'm so proud to be part of this team. We got a group of people that are technically competent, that are highly motivated that work together cooperatively that are buying into making Freeport, the foremost copper company in the world and keeping it there. And we have the capabilities on hand to meet and exceed our expectations, exceptional opportunities for our business. And I want you to know that regardless of what you read out in London, I'm planning on staying part of this team for as long as God's willing to allow me to do it. I'm having more fun now than I've had in years. And I'm really excited to be part of this team as we go forward. So Kathleen, I will turn it to you. Kathleen Quirk : All right, thank you Richard. And I'll just start on Slide 17 and make some comments on our operating and financial matters and then we can turn it over to your questions. We're providing some additional details on our fourth quarter operating activities on Slide 17. And as Richard said, the Lone Star mine, he has now renamed it is All Star Mine but it continues to perform above the design capacity, you'll recall we commissioned the mine in the second half of 2020. And last year, we produced 265 million pounds of copper. That was a 30% increase from the original design of 200 million pounds per year. We've incorporated now a further incremental expansion into our plants, which will take us up to 300 million pounds per year by 2023, with an investment of approximately $250 million. And as Richard mentioned, as we accelerate the mining of the upside ores, this will expose us to a larger sulfide opportunity. At Morenci, we're gaining momentum on our leach initiatives. We have substantial material that has already been placed on leach stockpiles, which provide an opportunity to increase our copper production at a low incremental costs and notably a low carbon footprint. We're applying new technologies and using data analytics and censoring to measure our success. And we're very encouraged by some early wins and are optimistic that there's much more to come. We started the effort at Morenci because of its significance, but the early wins at Morenci have allowed, the team at Morenci to share its findings across the portfolio. And this gives us a significant value opportunity for Freeport, and we hoped to report progress, ongoing progress to you as we go through the year. We also continue to ramp-up mining and milling rates at Morenci and we estimate that production from Morenci will be about 10% more copper in 2022 compared with 2021. In South America, our teams there doing great work to restore production to pre-pandemic levels. The 2021 sales from South America were about 8% higher than 2020 and we're projecting an additional increase in 2022. We continue to target a full restoration at Cerro Verde of its mill operations during this year. And we'll be on our way to getting back to a billion pounds per annum from this large scale operation. Our team at Cerro Verde continues to do outstanding work and managing the pandemic and had really a terrific fourth quarter. We were also successful in finalizing our multi-year labor agreements at Cerro Verde during 2021. At El Abra in Chile, we're making good progress and increasing our stacking rates of material on our leach pads there and we're also advancing construction of a new leach pad to accommodate the higher rates. We're expecting a 30% increase in 2022 production at El Abra off of a relatively low base. But we plan to sustain a level of 200 million to 250 million pounds per year for the next several years as we assess opportunities there for future growth. At Grasberg as Richard mentioned, the highlight of the year was really reaching our targeted net metal run rate in the fourth quarter. This was an enormous milestone of success for us. We're all proud of it. We're focused on sustaining this during 2022 and we'll have opportunities to increase our mill throughput rates in the second half of next year with the completion of our new SAG circuit which is under construction. Our team at Grasberg is as energetic as ever working to advance Kucing Liar and several other projects in the portfolio. Our next slide of Slide 18 is just an update on our progress to develop new smelting capacity in Indonesia to meet our commitments to the government. The site for the new smelter is starting to take shape as you can see from the photo on the slide. In the fourth quarter we completed the pile support for the flash furnace and are starting to pour concrete. We also completed agreements in the fourth quarter with our Japanese partner to expand the existing smelter at P.T. Smelting. We're focused on completing these projects as efficiently and timely as possible. We've been funding the cost of the smelter through a $1 billion bank credit facility that PT-FI secured and we're planning additional debt financing at PT-FI which can be obtained at attractive rates to complete the project. As indicated on the slide, the long-term cost of the financing for the smelter would be essentially offset by a phase out of the 5% export duty, so the economic impact is not material, we provide on Slide 19, a three year outlook for volumes and just we're pleased to report our execution is on track, we have some minor offsetting changes to our prior guidance for copper sales for 2022 and 2023 and now included our current outlook for 2024. After delivering a 19% increase in copper in 2021, we're projecting a 13% increase in 2022. And this includes higher production across the portfolio. We've got further growth planned for 2023 in our leasing plans and our sales for copper in 2022, we estimate about 36% will come from the U.S., 27% from South America, and about 37% from Grasberg. We're showing on Slide 20 how the quarterly volumes work out we're expecting grades will be lower in the first half at several of our sites in the Americas and that will be increasing throughout the year. You can see our gold sales are fairly steady and roughly 400,000 ounces per quarter during 2022. On Slide 21, we show a comparison of our net unit cash costs for 2021, and we roll that forward to 2022. And you can see that the costs are pretty similar between the years. For some time, our global team has been focused on cost management and efficiency projects to extend equipment lives, improve energy efficiencies, maintenance practices, and using technology to help us in all of this. This is serving us very well in the current environment. And we're also supported by is the great global supply chain team who's doing terrific work with our site operations management and through our partnerships with long-term suppliers to address our business needs. As you'll see on the slide, our estimated, consolidated year in cash costs for 2022 are expected to be very similar to 2021. We've got increases that we're experiencing in for input costs, including energy, sulfuric acid, we've got some higher labor and outside services costs for 2022 compared to 2021, and higher costs for materials and supplies, but that essentially is being offset by our higher volumes. We're going to continue to focus on cost management provide our operators with technology driven solutions to assist with the current cost pressures and inflationary environment. Richard mentioned the strong cash flows that we're generating, and we see that continuing in the future. On Slide 22, we show the significance of our cash flow using our volume and cost estimates and prices ranging from $4 to $5 copper, and holding gold flat at $1,800 per ounce and molybdenum at $19 per pound. We show modeled results excuse me using the average of 23 and 24 and you see here that annual EBITDA over this period would range from $12 billion per annum at $4 copper to over $16 billion per annum at $5 copper, and our operating cash flows would range from nearly $9 billion a year to $12 billion per year using these scenarios. As demonstrated in the last several quarters, we're generating significant free cash flow and this trend is expected to continue with cash flows significantly above our capital spending. Moving to capital spending, we show on Slide 23 our outlook for capital. For 2021, our capital expenditures, excluding the smelter costs totaled $1.9 billion and that was slightly below our guidance excluding the smelter of $2 billion. We're projecting capital of $3.3 billion in 2022 and $2.7 billion in 2023. The primary change from our guidance -- prior guidance for 2022 reflects the addition of the incremental Lone Star expansion, and our plans to advance the Circular project at Atlantic Copper. You'll also notice a large decrease in spend on the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ beginning in 2023. And you've also seen here the discretionary projects that we're advancing to improve profitability and value as we go forward and about 20% of the capital for the next two years reflects recent value enhancing additions. And those are detailed more on Slide 24, where we have a summary of the discretionary capital, we've added to our plan since achieving our net debt targets last year and commenced our shareholder return policy. These projects all have solid financial returns, great operational benefits and again represent value enhancing investments using a portion of the 50% of free cash flow, we are earmarking for organic investments and balance sheet improvement. Our free cash flow generation is significant. And that's supported by growing volumes, positive markets and low capital requirements. You'll see on Slide 25, and Richard highlighted this, not only the last what we've done over the last several years, but just in 2021 alone, we reduced our net debt on nearly $5 billion and our EBITDA continues to grow. We're really in a fantastic position to execute our strategy, maintain a solid balance sheet and return substantial cash to shareholders. Our financial policy is summarized on Slide 26 is centered around a strong balance sheet and combined with the performance based payout policy that provides for up to 50% of free cash flow to be used for shareholder returns with the balance for growth and further balance sheet improvements. As you'll see on Slide 27, we commenced the implementation of the policy following our board's actions in November of last year. We purchased nearly $500 million in stock in the fourth quarter, and through January to-date, our purchases, cumulative purchases total $600 million. We're well on our way to using our $3 billion authorization. Our Board also approved a variable dividend for 2022 which essentially doubles our common stock dividend. The combination of the share purchase program, and our dividends are designed to distribute 50% of our cash flow, while maintaining the balance sheet in a super strong position and providing flexibility for our long-term investments. So in summary, I just want to echo what Richard said, we're well positioned for success in 2022 and beyond. Our team is passionate about execution. We've got momentum, and we look forward to building on the success. And operator will now like to turn the call back to you to start the Q&A session. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Emily Chieng from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Emily Chieng : Good morning, Kathleen and thank you for the update this morning. My question is just around the Bagdad expansion. I believe in this slide. There is a comment around potential for construction to commence in 2023 with a potential 2026 turn out. That's could you talk about the progress you've made to date there and advancing sort of technical studies as well as any final hurdles to be met before project sanction and early indication of what CapEx could potentially look like for this CapEx? Kathleen Quirk : Emily, we are starting feasibility of that project now. And we've been working on various scoping level studies over the past several years, as we've been discussing, but we are starting the feasibility study, and that will really define the final cost estimates. But we think it'll be efficient, because we've got a lot of infrastructure already there. We're adding a new concentrator that really take into account the efficiencies that we've gained that Bagdad existing concentrator in recent years. And once we go forward and get the feasibility studies done, we have a limited permitting process we believe and that's what gives us hope that that project could be in operation in 2026. The economics of it will be -- we believe will be positive in really advancing in an efficient matter -- manner the production that double the production there, because it is a very long reserve life approximating roughly 80 years. And so we're bringing that, looking to bring that value forward. Emily Chieng : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lawson Langer from Bank of America Securities. Lawson Langer : Hello, good morning, Richard and Kathleen. Very nice to hear from you both and thank you for today's update. Maybe I can ask about the All Star Mine. Could you also -- could you update us in your thoughts in terms of what's driving the current outperformance? Is that just better recoveries or is there other aspects at play? And then when we think about the current Lone Star mine and your expansion to 300 million pounds. I mean, it's outperforming by 5% or 6%. So, how should we think about that 300 million pounds? Should we think about it in terms of being more like 318 million pounds to 320 million pounds? Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Josh, do you want to take that? Richard Adkerson : Yes, Josh, why don't you respond to it. Josh is our Chief Operating Officer for the Americas. Joshua Olmsted : Good morning. Yes, realistically if we look at Lone Star and what we've been able to achieve since we've started up. We really leveraged a lot of the learnings that we had seen from our exercises and experience at Bagdad with respect to identifying bottlenecks in the process, and leveraging the workforce through kind of an agile way of working. And as we've done that the team at Lone Star has been able to identify opportunities that really eliminated bottlenecks and allows us to work on incremental gains over time. And as we think about the next step in that. It was just a continuation of that same process in the sense of identifying what's limiting our ability to maximize the production of the site. And so the team has done a great job of going through that entire system, identifying what those bottlenecks are. And we put projects in place to really attack those bottlenecks and maximize where we're at. The 300 million pounds is probably at the limit of our current existing Hydromet facilities and the tank house capacity. So anything above and beyond that would be a bit of a challenge. But I'm not going to say that the team there isn't going to continue to look for opportunities to add additional incremental pounds. But I think that 300 million pound target that we're headed for is, is pretty close to that limit based on what we have today. Lawson Langer : Yes, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher LaFemina with Jefferies. Your line is open. Christopher LaFemina : Hi, thanks. Hi, Richard and Kathleen, thank you for taking my question. Richard Adkerson : Hi, Chris. Christopher LaFemina : So if we look at the progress that's report in the last five or six years, you've obviously overcome some really substantial challenges. And the company has -- you find yourself in a position of clear strength today. And you're kind of unleashing what is ultimately a massive organic growth pipeline with probably more growth than we even are aware of today, just because the resources are so substantial. And you talked today Richard about leaching technologies, as you mentioned last quarter as well, but you talked about this as a huge opportunity. And my question around that is, first of all, how much production potential could we see from these new leaching technologies? What's the timeframe? Is it in any good guidance yet? We're sort of operating costs, just like the economic benefit that you will realize from this leaching. And I guess the reason why I asked that question is because a lot of other major copper miners are talking about various new leaching technologies being substantial. And it really comes down to -- there's going to be an economic benefit due to having more volumes. But the question then is, what does it mean for overall global copper supply and demand? So how much when is it coming online, it is in your guidance and what sort of operating costs? Kathleen Quirk : We do have a small amount of benefit factored into our guidance from some early successes at Morenci. But that's just a very small fraction of what we expect to get. We do have some, and this is unfolding, Chris. So it's going to be evolving as we go. But we've kind of internally said, let's go after trying to get 100 million pounds to 200 million pounds from this -- in the near-term. And so where we're looking to gradually improve where we are in 2022, and you'll be hearing more about it. But from a cost standpoint, if you think about where the incremental costs of this is. We've got much of this materials already in our leach stockpiles. So we've already expanded the funds to mine it, and it's in stock piles. And so it's a very low incremental cost to be able to recover it. So that's the opportunity for us, as we look at it having low incremental capital to go after it low incremental operating costs. We have latent tank house capacity, Josh mentioned. We're filling the tank house at Safford. But at all of our mines, we've got some tank house capacity that that we can fill, if we're able to get more recoveries. So economically, this is a real opportunity for us. But when you're talking about 100 million pounds to 200 million pounds, and we've got 38 billion pounds of material and stockpiles, that's a small amount, but it does have value to us. And we hope to go capture it. But in terms of this being a sea change for supply for the industry. We just don't -- we don't see it, it'll take time. And it'll come out over time. But it is, it's a meaningful value opportunity for us as a company given our set of circumstances with the large stockpiles in the latent tank house capacity. And Cory I don't know if you want to add anything to that. But that's where we are with it. Cory Stevens : Thanks. No Kathleen, you covered it well. Richard Adkerson : Thank you. Cory Stevens, by the way is stepping up to lead our project development engineering and he is the key guy leading us on this -- in this deal. And Chris, in an earlier life back in the 80s, I was working in the oil and gas business when the shale business really got initially kicked off. And so this team here will tell you, I'm always looking around corners to say is there some kind of shale, oil and gas development it could change the industry like that did for the petroleum industry. And this is a huge opportunity for us, huge in the sense of being able to add value of significance. But in terms of being a shallow kind of sea change for the industry, as Kathleen called it. We think that's not in the guards. Christopher LaFemina : That's very helpful. Thank you, Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. Your line is now open. Michael Dudas : Good morning, Richard, Kathleen. Kathleen Quirk : Good morning. Michael Dudas : My questions around given the -- you highlighted that this coffee and supply growth that you see in the pipeline being somewhat thin. Can you may be characterized, like from where you thought a year ago, three or today. Given the political dynamics, especially in the two largest copper producing countries, and given your kind of positioning in much better jurisdiction. So it seems, is that going really be a delayed and further just in the next six to 12 months, as the industry kind of figures out how to best negotiate and deal with those new government's? And certainly, there could be some other opportunities over the next several quarters on those issues limiting. Even getting some of these much needed projects to get out in the marketplace by the end of this decade? Richard Adkerson : There's no question. I mean, you just look at our situation at our El Abra. We would be in a different situation with El Abra this what. It's a political issues about royalties and the fiscal regime for our copper production in Chile were different. We would be moving more aggressively right now with El Abra. What we're doing is we're preparing ourselves to move forward, but we're not we're deferring any decision to move forward until we get some clarity from the government in Chile. And so that's just one example. There's no question. It's affecting people. It's some have stability agreements. And the question is, the government's going to honor stability agreements. You've seen recently in other countries where miners have had to go back and change deals were they thought they had firm contractual agreements. We had to make some concessions in Indonesia to get our issue with the government resolve there, which we did in a favorable basis. But that's just reality around the world today. Michael Dudas : And if the U.S. look like it's a much better place to be relative to some of these other countries. Certainly your investment, what you're talking about today seems like you want to enhance and accelerate that in your asset profile? Richard Adkerson : Yes, well, in the U.S. I would make a distinction between Greenfield developments and brownfield developments. And all of our developments are Brownfield, it's places where we have established operations, and a solid track record of doing things in the right way. And we have developed a positive relationships with local communities and with governments, state, local governments, and with indigenous people. That's a different deal than trying to go in and developing a new mine, where there's not an existing mine, because mines inevitably significant mines have impacts on the physical environment where they operate on the local communities. There's competition for water resources. There's issues related to historical factors with indigenous people and all that make it much more complicated. You can tick off a list of projects in the U.S. that way. But there also international projects that face the same deal. So for us, the U.S. is particularly attractive, favorable tax situation, support for mines by communities. It's not true in other places in terms of having community, educational systems, health care systems. We were in other countries, we escalate and provide all that. So it's very attractive for us. We own all of our, virtually all of our lands in the U.S. and fee. So there's no royalties. And you think you look at the royalty rates that are being jacked up around the world, and that's a big difference. And then we have the company specific situation of having a significant net operating loss carry forward, maybe the only good. I'm trying to think was another, maybe the only good thing that came out on the oil and gas deal. We got a big NOL that protects us from taxes for years to come. Even though in U.S. we have lower tax rates, fundamentally than we do internationally. So for all those reasons, our established presence in the U.S. is really the big one that makes it so attractive to us. Michael Dudas : Appreciate that. Thank you, Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Your line is now open. Alex Hacking : Yes. Good morning, Richard and Kathleen, and thanks for the call. I just want to follow-up on a couple of the earlier questions. The CapEx for Bagdad, if that moves ahead. Would that be planned CapEx or discretionary? I assume it would be discretionary. And then just quickly on Lone Star. The increase in the production right, that you've achieved and it's been announced? Does that meaningfully pull forward the potential for the sulfide project by years or does it not really matter? Thanks. Richard Adkerson : No, well, Bagdad is totally discretionary. I mean, we could continue to operate the existing scale of business that we have there. If that were to make sense, I think what the markets we're facing and the opportunities that that poses, it's highly likely we'll do it, but it is discretionary. And we will update the market on plans as we make commitments to go forward, which I expect us to do. And the point about Lone Star is, you can just look back at the other major projects around the world where to get to the mineral resource you have to sometimes take years of investment in stripping to remove overburden to get down to the ore. Here, we have the benefit of mining the overburden, which is oxide ore profitably. And by doing that, we are stripping that material that is overlays the sulfide resource. So it is tremendously beneficial to the long-term development this opportunity. And as I said, we're going to make money out of this oxide. And at the end of the day, we're continuing drilling, continuing economic studies. But I see a future of building a major mill complex at Lone Star to process this very large sulfide resources we're talking about is 50 billion tonnes of ore. Kathleen Quirk : And Alex, I think if you were asking about specifically Bagdad with respect to the financial policy, the answer is yes. In terms of how we will treat that 50% that we're retaining of free cash flow. We're earmarking for future investments and growth as well as to maintain our balance sheet. So that's how we're thinking about it. Alex Hacking : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Carlos De Alba from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Carlos De Alba : Good morning, Rich and team. Just a question around cash costs for the year I guess for the first quarter, how should we -- could you provide a bit more color, I would have expected higher -- guidance for higher costs in the first quarter above and beyond the 135 per pound given the comment of lower grade suspected in the first half of the year. Are there other factors that will mitigate the negative implications on costs from the lower grade suspected in the first semester? Kathleen Quirk : Yes, well and part of it too is waiting, waiting the low cost in Indonesia to the higher costs in the U.S. and South America. So that's why you're not seeing much fluctuation between the first quarter and the full-year. Carlos De Alba : Thank you, Kathleen. Richard Adkerson : You think about as Indonesia ramps up, fourth quarter was $0.08 a pound for the year it was on the order of less than $0.20, I don't know, $0.18, $0.19 per pound and we see costs going forward with higher volumes in that same range in Indonesia. So, it's a big factor in our business and our team has done a good job of controlling costs and we're like everybody else, we have our energy costs and other input costs are going up. So it's just what we have to deal with. But that was the whole basis for putting these companies together, back in 2007 was to match up the Indonesian assets, which is special because of its copper grades and its gold content with these lower grade mines in America, which are profitable but which have higher costs. And so that's just a carryover benefit for what we did so many years ago. Carlos De Alba : Thanks for the color, Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Glick from JPMorgan. Richard Adkerson : Let me correct myself, I said 50 billion tonnes of ore at on start and 50 billion tonnes of copper resource. Michael Glick : Good morning, guys, just relative to your financial policy, could you remind us how often you'll revisit the variable portion of the policy on a practical basis? Kathleen Quirk : Our board reviews it on a regular basis formally, it's at least annually, but it's something that we review with the board on an ongoing basis. Michael Glick : Okay, got it. Thank you. Richard Adkerson : You can see the example for that what we did in the third quarter, when we started the policy of paying variable dividend buying stock back a year ago, when we started looking at this, we had planned to do that at our first meeting in 2022. But we have made such progress, markets were so good, we advanced it. So just a little color on the way we run Freeport, we don't have an annual planning process. We update our long-term plans every quarter and we go through a really disciplined process to do that. So everything is real time. So while we talked about looking at this financial policy on an annual basis, as Kathleen says, we talk with our board about it continually. And if things change, we don't limit ourselves to acting on any kind of straight jacket timeframe. Michael Glick : Got it. Thank you. That's helpful color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Abhi Agarwal from Deutsche Bank. Abhi Agarwal : Thanks, operator. Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. Thanks a lot for your presentation. Richard, you mentioned that you are in preliminary talks with the Indonesian government to extend the contract of work to beyond 2041. Can you share a bit more detail around what the critical path is for that agreement to be signed? Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Yes, we have preliminary talks, we really tried to address that years earlier. And it was just so complicated to get everything else done. It's in everybody's interest, all stakeholders interest for us to have a continuation of operations beyond 2041. It makes no sense for anybody for us to run this business with any kind of drop date. And so there's a broad acknowledgement that we need to do it. It's very preliminary, so I don't have the answers to your questions about how we structured, what we would mean. But I can say that these preliminary talks are being very well received. And there's a recognition that it's in everybody's interest for us to go beyond 2041. Abhi Agarwal : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos from John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC. John Tumazos : Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Hey, John. John Tumazos : First on Moly, recently as 2017-18, the output was 95 million pounds. And industry statistics are 5.4% decline in World Mine Output last year through November. So I guess a lot of the copper mines are having lower Moly grades, world steel and stainless steel outputs are rising. Do you have any opportunities to expand Moly throughput further to offset the lower grades at Cerro Verde or some of the other copper mines? Kathleen Quirk : Well, John, we have two primary molybdenum mines in Colorado, the Climax mine and the Henderson mine and we did cut back production from those mines, when the market was in a different situation than it is today. But we do have the opportunity to expand production from our primary mines, particularly at Climax and we're doing some work now to advance some stripping activities, so that we do have more flexibility in the future to raise our primary molybdenum mine production to respond to this increased demand and limited supplies of Bolivia. So we do have a lot of optionality in our primary mine for molybdenum. John Tumazos : Thank you. Concerning the costs in Indonesia for smelting, you're reporting $0.24 for treatment charges and $0.20 for export duties. That I guess those are averages where some of the output is in country at Gresik and some of it is exported concentrates. If it were say half and half domestic versus export, would it be right to think of the costs of something like $0.18, when you export concentrates to Asia and $0.30 for the treatment costs at your own smelter. And then the export duties would be nothing if you treated them at your own smelter more than $0.20 for that portion, you're exporting maybe $0.40? Richard Adkerson : Yes, you're directionally right, John. And maybe we'll get back to you with some details, because I think some of the export numbers that you talked about are in the range of what we're doing it is $0.16 to $0.18. And we do pay this export duty while the cost for domestic processing at the smelter, will be much higher particularly when you provide for any kind of cost factor for the capital that will go into it, it will eliminate the export duty and so the net economic effect on PT-FI together with the fact that the cost of the smelter will be included in PT-FI's consolidated tax return. So any kind of cost to go through there will serve to reduce taxes. So the reduction in taxes not having to pay the export duty. In a broad sense offsets the economics to PT-FI buildings smelter. Kathleen Quirk : Yes, so as we're thinking about it John, the capital costs, amortization over the long period of the smelter will essentially offset the duty. And then really, when you look at the operating costs, the cash operating costs of the smelter, it shouldn't be that much different than exporting than TCRCs, so that's kind of how we were thinking about the two elements. Richard Adkerson : And that was a point that I think, I just don't have the numbers in front of me, John, but I don't think the cost of processing at PT smelting is as high as you indicated, the current deal, and we're expanding that smelter by 30% too as part of this effort to achieve the goal of in country processing. But it's a very efficient smelter. We built it back in the mid-90s. And it's kind of its world class in terms of its cost management. John Tumazos : Thank you. So out of complicated details. Richard Adkerson : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jatinder Goel from BNP Paribas Exane. Jatinder Goel : Thank you, operator. Good morning, Richard and Kathleen and good afternoon for those in the other time zones. Question on your 2024 copper guidance, can you please indicate where which operations will drop volumes, there'll be a 300 million pounds drop year-in-year in 2024 and Grasberg is now flat. So which operations will see that drop? And is that just a one year blip or is that a continued trend just to understand because Grasberg will lose 150 million pounds in 2025, as well. But just trying to put that discretionary and growth CapEx in perspective with the guidance and what we can't see beyond 2024. Thank you. Richard Adkerson : I'll like Kathleen, maybe Josh, talk to that. But I just make a point that these mine clan projections are subject to constant adjustments for various reasons that and some of them results in some volumes going from one year to another, but they all reflect steps taken to maximize the long-term values of the mine, we don't run these mines to achieve any kind of targeted, predetermined targets for volumes. But as I said, we have a dynamic, real time planning process in our goals throughout all those planning process is how do we maximize the long-term NPV and the resources that we have. And so you will, you look back at our history, there's continuous shifting of volumes from one year to the next and specifically. Kathleen Quirk : Specific to '23 versus '24, we do have some lower grades in some of the U.S. operations, notably at Morenci and some slightly lower grades at Cerro Verde from '23 to '24. But as we talked about earlier, we don't have anything in here for of any consequence for this leaching opportunity. And so we are all motivated to get additional volumes with low capital intensity from that leaching opportunity. And then we've got Bagdad coming in beyond that. And we've got a series of other opportunities as well. But that's, it's really some grade as Richard was talking about, we do have grades shifting from year-to-year and do have some lower grades in 2024 versus '23. Jatinder Goel : Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Terentiew from Stifel. Alex Terentiew : Hi, yes everybody. Thanks for taking my call. Just a couple of follow-ups to some questions already asked, first at that Kucing Liar in the Indonesian license discussions beyond 2041, is the pace of investment at that project dependent on those talks. And the second follow-up question if I may is on the Moly business. The price has obviously been quite strong the past year gone from about $12 to $19, can you give us any insight as to the demand outlook, I understand you guys have an opportunity, interesting opportunities to expand but anything you can say about demand outlook for the next one or two years? Kathleen Quirk : On the KL, all of our economics will run on the basis of the 2041. So if we are successful in extending it, there's going to be a lot more reserves from KL and other orebodies that come in. But we've run the economics in our plans based on the 2041 date, and it's a very attractive project that Mark can talk to you more about this but we're really leveraging all the learnings that we gained from Deep MLZ and Grasberg Block Cave to continue our momentum in extending development and leverages off of all the infrastructure we have there. So it's really a good project on its own. And we'll just be even better if we're able to extend beyond the 2041. Richard Adkerson : Just one quick comment on that. With all these years of uncertainty related to our deal with Indonesian government now, the 2041, we've done in the fact that we had such resources already discovered to fill up our mill and so forth. We haven't done much exploratory type drilling in Grasberg district for some time now. And so that's one of the main factors that makes it desirable for all stakeholders would be for us to have a deal that goes beyond 2041, which would then allow us to undertake more delineation core drilling, our exploratory core drilling, just look at that schematic that we had on the orebodies that are there, and where they're located and where they've come from. And historically, it's just clear that that while we don't know yet, because we haven't drilled it, but the high likelihood is there's a lot more resources there that haven't yet been identified. Alex Terentiew : Okay, there's great, thanks, guys. Kathleen Quirk : Mike Kendrick is on the line. And he can share with you some of our feelings about the outlook for demand from Moly. Michael Kendrick : Thanks, Kathleen. Well, a few thoughts on that is we're positive on the outlook for Moly over the next few years, you things like energy, whether it's traditional energy sources that require Moly bearing steels or if it's renewables are all very positive right now. Infrastructure development, all around the world uses Moly and is we've seen whether it's here, Europe, China, Asia, all very positive indicators and pollution control in general uses a lot of stainless steel. And there again, we're seeing very positive indicators. Our customer base, both in Europe, United States have positive outlooks over the next few years. And then if you look at the Chinese five year plan, there's definitely an up scaling of materials that they're using throughout their economy and what they're emphasizing. So we're relatively optimistic on demand. Alex Terentiew : That's great. Thank you. Michael Kendrick : Thanks, Mike. Michael Kendrick : You bet. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Carlos De Alba : Thank you very much for squeezing me in for the second time. Just on working capital, if I maybe Kathleen, the sensitivity on a number you provide guidance on international operations is around $8 billion this year, and that is made of $1.3 billion working capital and other uses. So I don't know exactly how much is working capital, but assuming that is the majority of the $1.3 billion, could you give us some color on that, I mean that's a bigger number for working capital than I was expecting? Kathleen Quirk : Yes, and you saw we had a benefit, a large benefit during 2021. A big portion of that is the timing of our tax payments internationally. You generally paying on the prior-year schedule. And so there's some timing variances when you have rising volumes or rising profitability. And so that's just the timing of tax payments. Carlos De Alba : Got it, thank you very much. Operator : Now, let's go over to management for any closing remarks. Richard Adkerson : Yes, thank you all for participating in the call today. It is real pleasure to be able to report great progress our team is making and we look forward to continuing that progress and are really excited about what lies ahead for us. So thank you for your interest and if you have any further questions or need for follow-up, please contact David Joint and we will respond to you. Have a good day everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter 2022 operating and financial results, and a copy of our press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com.  Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.  Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K.  On the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and CEO. I'd also like to welcome Maree Robertson, our new CFO. She's joining us today on the call, and Maree joined us in March. We're delighted to have her on our team. Mark Johnson is on, who is the COO of our Indonesian business; Josh Olmsted, who is the COO of our Americas business; Mike Kendrick is on, who runs our global molybdenum business; and Steve Higgins is also on today, our Chief Administrative Officer.  Richard is going to start by making some opening comments and then we'll be going through the slide materials and the outlook included in our slide materials. So Richard, I'll turn it to you. Richard Adkerson : Yes. Thanks, Kathleen. We're going to follow a new format for our earnings presentation today. This format reflects the current position of our company after years, literally years of having to deal with significant company-specific problems that are now largely behind us.  We have a clear mission in Freeport, and that is to be foremost in copper. I will make some very brief opening comments. Kathleen will review our positive first quarter results, our positive outlook, and then we'll be available to answer questions. The case for copper as a commodity is strong. I've been saying this for 20 years, but it's never been better.  Demand is growing globally. Globally, growth is no longer dependent solely on China. With COVID recovery, infrastructure spending, the spread of electricity everywhere, it's generating significant growth in Europe. Business is strong in the U.S. and in Asia, outside China.  The coming demand for carbon reduction and its impact on copper demand is truly extraordinary, and it's coming. It's beginning, but it's not here now. Copper supply development for many reasons is challenging. As I said recently, the supply challenge can't be solved simply by higher prices.  I find it notable that the price of copper today is $4.50 in a world where there are a whole series of economic headwinds. Many of these are transitory. Higher copper prices in the future are likely, and I'm very comfortable with Freeport's strategy of focusing this business on copper. Our strategy to achieve our mission of being foremost in copper straightforward.  We will execute our operating plan safely and responsibly. We have an unmatched set of globally diverse copper-producing assets. We are taking advantage of emerging technology involving data analytics, new work practices and increasingly important advancing and leaching technology where Freeport is well positioned as a global leader in leaching. We will be developing organic growth projects in a disciplined way over time from our large set of undeveloped resources. We will execute our financial plan, maintain our currently strong balance sheet while returning significant cash to shareholders. Other opportunities for Freeport may arise, and we are positioned to take advantage if they do, but our strategy is focused internally.  Here's a few points I suggest you note in Kathleen's presentation. Look at our strong execution of our plans in the first quarter. Look at our success in meeting the challenges of higher input costs, both through effective cost management and the benefit of past strategic decision.  For example, the long-term development of Grasberg mine and its high copper and gold grades, higher gold grades or higher gold prices are helping to offset input cost increases. Note, our positive situation in Indonesia. With our partner, shareholder MIND ID with the government of Indonesia, local communities and workforce. We worked hard to achieve this. Our environmental performance in a very challenging location is exemplary in Indonesia. The financial results are spectacular, reflecting the good work of our PT-FI team and literally 3 decades of efforts and investments getting to where we are today. We're progressing with the development of a new large-scale smelter in Indonesia.  Our recent international bond financing at PT-FI was a major milestone for our company. Our team achieved investment-grade ratings and a strong market reception for this $3 billion financing. Looking back years ago, I would have envisioned our ability to do this. 2/3 of our copper is produced in the Americas, where our team is operating effectively and where we have significant growth for the future. And finally, I want to briefly note steps we have taken this past year to build a high-quality sustainable Board of Directors and a sustainable management team for the future. These are commitments I personally made to myself a year ago when I became Chairman.  We've added 6 new directors in a year, and you'll be able to see the details on this in our proxy, which will soon be available. Four of these 6 are individuals with significant international large company CEO experience, 2 have significant business and financial expertise. Together with the 4 continuing independent directors, we now have a high-quality Board, one that Freeport has long deserved. Building this Board is a highlight in my personal professional career.  At the same time, we made important changes to our management team. Kathleen mentioned that Maree has recently joined us as our CFO. At a young age, she has a distinguished career in international mining. We've made a number of transitions of important positions with internal promotions and added significant capabilities with external hires, particularly in the ESP area.  We now have a younger, more diverse management team at Freeport. They are great people who embrace a special culture we have with the Freeport Global family. I'm personally excited about continuing as a member of this team, blessed to be in good health and energy. I am confident now that Freeport now has a Board and management team that is capable of achieving our mission and executing our strategy beyond my tenure.  With that, Kathleen, I'll turn it over to you. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, Richard. And I'll start on Slide 3. Richard mentioned, we had a really good first quarter. Slide 3 summarizes the highlights. We achieved meaningful growth in volumes and margins which translated into strong cash flows and significant cash returns to shareholders.  Our copper and gold sales were 24% higher for copper than the year ago quarter and 59% higher for gold than the year ago quarter. Our copper sales were 6% above our guidance going into the year. We benefited from strong U.S. demand in the quarter, which allowed us to reduce inventories.  Our gold sales were also above our plan, 8%. After reaching the targeted metal run rates in late 2021, Grasberg is operating well and sustaining the high-volume, low-cost operation.  Our average unit net cash cost for the quarter of $1.33 per pound came in under our guidance in the first quarter and below the year ago quarterly average. This is particularly impressive given the cost pressures affecting all of us and allowed us to generate strong margins with average copper realizations of $4.66 per pound during the quarter. Notably, Grasberg's costs were a net credit of $0.06 per pound in the quarter.  Richard referenced this earlier, but this means that the gold revenues more than offset all of our cash production costs at the site. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $3.4 billion in the quarter; and adjusted net income, excluding nonrecurring charges of $1.6 billion or $1.07 per share for the first quarter.  We generated very strong operating cash flows, totaling $1.7 billion. This was net of about $800 million in working capital uses, primarily reflecting the timing of our cash taxes. Our cash flow significantly exceeded our capital spending and that allowed us to return substantial cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet.  We continued our share repurchase program during the quarter, funded nearly $600 million of share purchases. Since starting the program in November of last year, we have purchased 27 million shares at an average cost of approximating $42 per share. We're $1.1 billion into the program out of a total of $3 billion.  Our total share repurchases and common stock dividends, which doubled from the last year's rate, approached $800 million in the first quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong. Net debt was $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter. About half of this relates to financing of the Indonesian smelter project, which is advancing.  As Richard said, as we look forward, we're enthusiastic about the embedded opportunities our asset can bring to supply the world's rising demand for copper. With several projects, we are progressing with near-term, medium-term and longer-term horizons. We're continuing to dedicate significant resources to our sustainability objectives and now lead the industry with 9 of our operating sites certified under the Copper Mark. We have a strong foundation for success. We're executing our strategy very effectively, and we'll continue to focus on delivering on our plans.  Slide 4 is just a summary of the recent reports that we filed, our annual report to shareholders and just today filing our 2021 sustainability report. Our theme for our recent annual report is titled Electrifying the Future, and it highlights our assets and the prominent role that Freeport has in supplying modern uses for copper. We also published the sustainability report. This marks our 21st year of reporting on our sustainability programs. As a leader in the industry, we also want to lead in our reporting and transparency in this important area. We really hope you'll have the opportunity to review the report in detail, it's available on our website.  We're proud of the work we're doing. It's embedded in all of our business plans and supports our responsible production practices. On Slide 5, we had a neat deal earlier this month. We celebrated PT Freeport Indonesia's 55th anniversary. We've operated at this same site for more than 5 decades, and we've developed one of the industry's most prominent operations, providing tens of thousands of jobs and meaningful economic impacts to the Indonesian government and province of Papua.  As Richard mentioned, we've invested heavily over the years to create a modern, world-class operation there that will benefit all stakeholders for decades to come. We lead the industry in technology, supporting our large-scale block cave mining. And as Richard mentioned, with our new partnership with the government established in 2018 and our committed and focused team, we're enthusiastic about the future for this exceptional mining district.  Turning to markets. Richard covered this in his comments, we view the fundamental outlook of the copper business is very positive, supported by copper's role in the global economy, a renewed focus on infrastructure, connectivity and copper's essential role in meeting global decarbonization targets.  The demand trends are broad-based and global in nature. We see this continuing and accelerating with the increased intensity of use for copper associated with modern applications. Many are predicting we're in the early stages of a multiyear period of rising demand.  Over the last decade, most of the growth in demand has come from China. As Richard mentioned, we're now seeing a major expansion of growth and demand for copper for infrastructure spending and decarbonization from Western world economies. The scarcity of new mine supply development is growing at a time when demand is rising. The project pipeline of actional development opportunities is significantly lower than it has been historically. Beyond the projects which are being completed now, there's a real absence of new supply development necessary to meet estimated demand increases. The current physical markets are tight, as evidenced by the low level of inventories on global exchanges. Supply chain continues to be stretched.  While we'll see macro factors such as China's economy, geopolitical considerations and actions by the Fed impacting sentiment, the low level of inventories and supply limitations sets us up for a scenario of higher prices in the future. We're in a great position at Freeport as a responsible producer of scale and the strategies Richard outlined focused on copper, long-lived reserves and future growth options, the prospects are bright for our portfolio become more scarce and highly valued in the future.  I'll comment a little bit about some details of our first quarter operations, moving to Slide 7. In the U.S., the Lone Star mine continues to perform well above design capacity. As you remember, we commissioned the mine in late 2020 and produced 265 million pounds of copper in 2021, a 30% increase from the original design.  We're expanding further to take us to 300 million pounds per annum by 2023 with an investment of roughly $250 million. As we accelerate the mining of oxide ores at Lone Star, this will expose a much larger sulfide opportunity for us in the future. At Morenci, our largest mine in the North American portfolio, we completed the restart of our mill in March. We've been ramping up for several months and are now running at capacity.  With the rise in COVID cases early in the quarter, our mining rates were constrained, resulting in the reduction in annual production compared with our prior expectations. We are back on track. We expect Morenci to produce 7% more copper in 2022 compared with last year.  As Richard mentioned, we're also advancing our leach recovery initiatives. We're focused at Morenci using data analytics, and new technologies to enhance our leach production. This is a significant value-enhancing opportunity for Freeport, and we'll be reporting progress on this initiative as we go through the year.  At Bagdad, we are advancing our plans for what we're calling the Bagdad 2x project to double production at this mine in Northwest Arizona. We're advancing studies and planning to commence early works, principally for mine equipment and additional stripping in parallel with the studies.  Turning to South America. The teams have done exceptional work navigating the pandemic. When things started to improve in late '21, we had a spike in cases in January and February in Peru, that did have an impact on our mining rates in the first quarter by about 10%. Situation improved significantly in March, we expect to reach our targeted mill rates of 400,000 tons per day in the balance of the year. The lower mining rate in the first quarter is expected to have a small impact on our 2022 production at Cerro Verde compared with our prior plans, but we still see 8% growth in Cerro Verde production in 2022 compared with 2021.  We continue to target a full restoration at Cerro Verde this year and be on our way back to 1 billion pounds per annum from this large-scale operation. El Abra has been successful in Chile in increasing the stacking rate of material on its leach pad. We expect a 30% increase in 2022 production at El Abra and to sustain a level of 200 million to 250 million pounds per annum for the next several years, as we assess opportunities for future growth.  At Grasberg, we sustained our large-scale metal production after reaching our targeted metal run rate in the fourth quarter of last year. We achieved higher gold recoveries compared with our plan, which contributed to a favorable variance for the quarter.  Our 2022 volumes are consistent with our prior forecast for Grasberg. We incorporated some relatively small adjustments for changes in mine sequencing in Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ, but the 5-year metal forecast is generally consistent with prior expectations. We're advancing mill projects to provide additional capacity targeted for the second half of next year.  We're diversifying our power sources in Indonesia, and we're advancing the long-term development for Kucing Liar. The team there is doing outstanding work and managing and sustaining the largest and most profitable underground operation in the world.  On the next slide, Richard touched upon the leach opportunities we have at Freeport. And this is a major initiative ongoing that we have to extract more value from our historical leach stockpiles. This could unlock significant value for us by increasing production from material already mined and placed on to stockpiles.  In the context of an industry where new projects can take 10 years to develop, this is a significant opportunity for us to bring the equivalent of a new mine on stream in a fraction of the time it takes to develop with a fraction of the carbon footprint, very little incremental capital and operating costs. So a tremendous value opportunity for us, and we're pursuing it with urgency.  During the first quarter, we commenced the process to insulate our leach stockpiles to retain heat. Heat is proven to improve leach recoveries and work to date has indicated the potential to incrementally add to our production in the near term. We're also enhancing our processes with the use of data analytics. This tool is providing new insights and opportunities. We're working on internal technologies for additives, as well as with third parties who have proprietary technologies. We're optimistic that these collective initiatives have the opportunity to add an incremental 100 million to 200 million pounds of copper across our Americas portfolio in the near term.  Early success will enable us to optimize and expand this potential moving forward. As you'll see in the charts, we currently estimate 38 billion pounds of copper in our stockpiles, which already has been mined, but this is not included in our reserves or production plans.  A significant portion of this opportunity is at our flagship Morenci mine and our cross-functional team of technical experts, metallurgists, mine planners, data scientists, geologists and business analysts are all working together to take full advantage of this great opportunity for us. The leach opportunity is just one facet of our growth, and Richard touched upon what we'll be focusing on as we go forward. We have multiple options -- looking at Slide 9, multiple options for brownfield, low-risk growth across the portfolio.  Recall, we have over 190 billion pounds of copper mineral resources in our portfolio in addition to the proven and probable reserves of over 100 billion pounds of copper. We talked about the leach opportunity and the ongoing oxide expansion at Lone Star, these are near-term opportunities to add incremental production in a 12- to 18-month time frame.  In the medium term, we're highly optimistic that we'll double the size of Bagdad in the 2026 time frame. We expect to complete the feasibility study in the first half of next year and be in a position to commence construction activities. Longer term, we have the massive Lone Star sulfide opportunity of 50 billion pound copper resource in our established mining area in Eastern Arizona.  The El Abra project in Chile has a resource approaching 30 billion pounds. We've done a lot of work in identifying an operation that could produce over 700 million pounds of copper per annum. We're closely monitoring the developments in Chile, and we'll defer our decision for the time being, pending the results of the ongoing constitutional work that's being done in the country. At Kucing Liar in the Grasberg district, it's a natural extension of our operations. This will allow us to continue our large-scale operation in Papua for decades to come. We believe the world will need our projects in the future. We have a long track record of success in qualifying and developing projects in an efficient, responsible manner.  And this is enhanced by our industry-leading technical capabilities, our established license to operate and our strong franchises in our areas of focus. Looking at our sales profile on Slide 10, this is the annual sales for the next few years that we update each quarter.  The outlook for volumes is largely in line with our prior forecast and the execution of our plans is on track. We have insignificant changes to our prior guidance for copper sales for 2022 and 2023 in the 1% range. That principally reflects the COVID downtime experienced in the Americas earlier this year and some timing changes at Grasberg between 2023 and 2025.  After delivering a 19% increase in copper sales in 2021, we're projecting a 12% increase in 2022, reflecting higher production across the portfolio and further growth in 2023. We estimate about 36% of our sales for this year will come from our U.S. mines, 27% from South America and 37% from Indonesia.  On Slide 11, there's been a lot of discussion about cost pressures in our industry. The cost pressures that we're facing -- that the entire industry is facing this year are well-documented. Energy and other commodity-related inputs such as sulfuric acid, explosives, grinding media and other consumables have increased. We'll continue to work to manage and mitigate these impacts to the extent possible. We also benefit from the fact that our byproduct credits, particularly for gold, provide mitigation.  We show a reconciliation of our prior unit net cash for 2022 estimates based on our January estimates compared to our current estimates. We've updated all of our plans to incorporate recent commodity pricing and our latest operating plans. You'll see here that half of the unit cost increase is offset by stronger gold prices and production. Bottom line, unit cash costs are up about $0.09 per pound of copper or an approximate 7% increase. These numbers were built off a copper price assumption that was $0.25 per pound above the prior plan. But we're looking today at $4.70 copper at current market with a cash cost of $1.44 estimated for this year, which will generate very strong margins for us.  We show, on the next slide, Slide 12, the significant cash flow generation at various prices. This is a great strength of Freeport, a big exposure to copper markets and the large-scale nature of our existing capacity. We're in an enviable position with our significant new production that we brought online in recent quarters. And we show on the slide, Slide 12, the significance of cash flow generation using our volume and cost estimates and prices ranging from $4 to $5 copper.  These are modeled results using the average of 2023 and 2024 with current volume and cost estimates. In our annual EBITDA, these prices from $4 to $5 per pound, prices are closer to $5 today than $4 would average over $11 billion at $4 copper to nearly $16 billion per annum at $5 copper. And operating cash flows very strong, ranging from over $8 billion to approach $12 billion at $5 copper. Also on the chart, we've got sensitivities to various commodities. We can't predict prices, but the long-term fundamentals of our business indicate the prospects for higher copper prices. And as we go forward, you can note that each $0.25 per pound change in copper equates to over $1 billion in annual EBITDA.  We'll generate significant free cash flow. We expect this to continue with cash flows significantly above our capital spending. And you'll see the capital spending on Slide 13. These are largely unchanged from our prior guidance. We're forecasting some offsetting timing differences between 2022 and 2023. And I've also included some early equipment purchases for our Bagdad expansion project in 2023, as well as ramping up the Kucing Liar project.  Both of these projects are designated as discretionary projects for purposes of our available cash returns framework. We've got a tracking of the discretionary category included for your reference in the appendix. Roughly 25% of our capital spend over the next 2 years is associated with value-enhancing projects.  These projects all have solid financial returns and operational benefits, and we'll use a portion of the 50% of free cash flow we are earmarking for organic investments toward these discretionary projects. I'll also note, and you'll see this in the slide, we've got a large decrease in spend on the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ from 2022 to 2023, totaling $500 million.  So as those projects are being fully developed, we'll see our planned capital expenditures coming down. The next slide, we provide an update on our activities for the smelter. We were engaged in detailed engineering and procurement and early construction activities are advancing with pilings and concrete installation.  We've got about 2,000 workers now on site, and that will grow to over 10,000 workers next year. We've got some updated photos for your reference in the appendix. And as we've been talking about for some time, this project is important for PT Freeport Indonesia and the Indonesian government. We are focused on completing the project as efficiently and timely as possible.  Richard mentioned the successful bond offering we did earlier this month, raised $3 billion to support the cost of the smelter, long-term financing, average duration of roughly 14 years and an average cost of 5.4%. Richard mentioned the investor response, it was very positive and reflects the strength of PT-FI's underlying business.  The cost of this financing is largely offset by a phaseout of the 5% export duty. So the economic impact of the smelter is not material. Turning to the balance sheet. It's a core focus of ours and has been for the last several years. We've made meaningful progress in reducing our debt and our whole financial policy is centered around maintaining a strong balance sheet.  We reduced our debt just over the last 12 months by nearly $4 billion, and our EBITDA continues to grow. Our free cash flow is significant, as you've seen, with growing volumes, positive markets and low capital requirements. We are in a fantastic position to execute the strategy of maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing in our long-term future and returning substantial cash to shareholders.  Last slide that we'll cover is a summary of the financial policy. On Slide 16, we show a scorecard of our shareholder returns. Those have increased meaningfully with a period of strong execution and balance sheet improvement. We began implementing the Board-authorized performance payout policy in November of last year. The combination of our share purchase program with dividends are designed to distribute 50% of our cash flow after capital expenditures, excluding the smelter investments and discretionary projects.  Since November of 2021, when we began to implement the program, we've utilized about 1/3 of the authorized $3 billion share purchase program. We've purchased 27 million shares, common stock at an average cost of just under $42 per share. We also have a variable dividend component in our common stock dividends for 2022. This is double the base dividend and the first payment at this higher rate was made in the first quarter of this year. Our Board will have the opportunity to consider additional actions as we progress the program further. I mentioned in the first quarter alone, returns to shareholders totaled nearly $800 million. With a continuation of favorable market conditions, solid execution of our plans, we expect shareholder returns to continue to be strong.  As Richard mentioned, we have exceptional opportunities in our business. As a team, we are meeting the challenges and embracing the opportunities. Our future is very bright, and we at Freeport are electrifying the future, and we're going to do this responsibly, reliably and relentlessly.  So that's a summary of our quarter and outlook. And now we'd like to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Christopher LaFemina : Question about, Kathleen, you mentioned the sensitivities and every $0.25 per pound change in copper is about $1 billion in annualized EBITDA. But then on the slide where you show the new 2022 cost guidance, I think it's a $0.09 per pound increase in guidance. And you said that there was a $0.25 per pound increase in your price assumption when you derive that guidance.  So the question is, if we think about changes in the copper price, should we assume that a $0.25 increase in the price fully translates into that $1 billion of EBITDA? Or do we need to adjust that for some sort of cost increase as well? And if we do, how much of a cost increase should we expect to reach $0.25? In other words, is that $0.09 per pound increase in costs associated with the 25% increase in price, kind of the way we should think about cost and prices moving together? I'm not sure if that question makes sense, but I'm just trying to understand the sensitivity to prices and costs. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. We understand the question. The sensitivities that we show are just in terms of the copper price without having changes in input prices. I think right now, what we're seeing is increases that are unusual, correlations that are unusual. Energy prices have risen in some of these other commodities like sulfuric acid and the explosives and things like that, all reflecting kind of a geopolitical situation.  I don't think the long-term trends, if you look at the correlation between copper prices and some of these inputs, are as dramatic as what we're seeing this year. Time will tell, we'll see, but we don't expect to see these kinds of $0.09 increases for $0.25 move in copper prices. It will depend on, obviously, the fundamentals of each commodity.  But right now, some of the commodities are moving in a direction differently on a short-term basis because of what we're seeing in the Russia-Ukraine situation. Christopher LaFemina : And just a follow-up to that. And going back to the China cycle, obviously, many years ago, but was the cost inflation that you saw then very different from what you're seeing today? In other words, do you think that the war is having a disproportionate impact on cost inflation today? Or are we just seeing generally typical cost inflation that we get in bull markets and commodities? Richard Adkerson : Well, if you go back, I'll talk about three years of copper demand, when copper was correlated to industrial production before China emerged in roughly 2003 as the China era, and now we're in a new era of copper prices, it's been various factors. Back when copper was cyclical and driven by industrial production in the developed world, there was a correlation between prices. But then when China emerged and copper prices went from a dip below $0.70 and went to $4 in a short period of time when nobody was expected, there wasn't a correlation with prices.  Today, it is affected by the dislocations caused by Russia and the situation in Ukraine, particularly with oil and gas prices, I mean, and you'll just have to reach your own judgment of how sustainable that is or how much is the impact of the current situation. But there are other commodities, it's having an impact on copper prices, but Russia was a relatively small producer of copper globally of 3%, 4% and regionally affected markets and the market is so tight, it has an impact, but other commodities are being more effective than copper.  And as I said, many of these things, I believe, are transitory. So we're taking steps where we can to control prices. Copper prices are rising faster than cost for us. So our profitability is growing, and we're encouraged about that continuing into the future. Kathleen Quirk : Yes, our diesel costs that we went into the year with our plan of roughly $2.50 a gallon. We've increased that in this most recent guidance by about 40%. And normally, we would not see that kind of dislocation. And when we look at the long-term trends of diesel prices and copper prices, we normally wouldn't see that.  So same holds for some of the fertilizers and ammonia nitrate, the product we use for explosives, has gone up a lot, as sulfuric acid has as well. And we believe a lot of those are up just generally because of commodity prices, but the Ukraine and Russia situation has exacerbated some of that. So we don't see it as a long-term cost in our structure at those levels. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs. Emily Chieng : My first question is a little bigger picture in nature and related to how you're thinking about growth. Perhaps how have increasing steel costs, raw materials, consumables and labor change, the business case, if at all, when you think about sanctioning brownfield and greenfield production longer term? Richard Adkerson : Emily, those really aren't driving factors on our investment decisions. The resources that we have are just economically not that sensitive to even these kind of price increases. So we -- our timing issue on the brownfield development projects is, one related to engineering and permitting and community relations and things like that. These are things that affect supply development across the industry, and it's a double-edged sword of copper. It's a major factor of why copper prices are so strong. So we'll factor in the higher prices, but when we undertake a project, the investment decision is not going to be driven by those factors, but by others. For example, in Chile, we're awaiting making investment decision on El Abra, which is a great project, but there's a lot of uncertainties about the government policy towards mining in Chile. And so that's what we're monitoring before we make -- proceed with an investment decision there. Kathleen Quirk : And Emily, the leaching opportunity that we have, we don't have exposure to steel and structural costs for that opportunity. And that's why we're really pushing that with a sense of urgency because that really is very low capital intensity and operating cost intensity that will translate right to our bottom line if we can crack that code.  So it's the equivalent of bringing on a new mine without having all the capital costs. So that is -- that would be a really, really strong thing for us as a company if we can continue to advance the leaching opportunity. Richard Adkerson : And on position, how well positioned Freeport is to take advantage of that -- those advancements. We're the largest leaching operation in the world. Morenci is the largest single mine from leaching, and it's been part of our company's experience for decades. So we're really excited about it. Emily Chieng : Great. That makes a lot of sense. And just real quick, if I can follow up on labor markets? And I appreciate any color that you have on the labor cost component than some of that might be higher profit sharing. But anything that you can share on the workforce outlook or labor availability would be helpful. I'll leave it at that. Richard Adkerson : Well, thanks, Emily, and I'll let Kathleen follow up. But we do have a special situation with our large workforce in Peru, where under government laws and regulations, there is a mandated profit-sharing plan. And so as profits goes up, their workers automatically benefit in higher wages as part of that process. But Kathleen, why don't you follow up generally on labor cost elsewhere? Kathleen Quirk : Yes. The main thing that we're experiencing, Emily, in terms of labor is really focused more in the U.S., the main issue. We -- it's a very competitive job environment, as you've seen. We've got significant job openings in our U.S. operations. We've been supplementing our workforce with outside contractors to help us with projects and capacity assurance.  And so really, you're seeing more utilization of contractors right now. But we have made some progress in hiring in the first quarter. We've been -- and have had a number of openings for several months, and we're starting to make progress in the first quarter and getting these positions filled. So -- but I'd say it's more a matter of tightness in terms of availability of people as opposed to really big increases in wage rates.  We have increased our wage rates, and we've provided some supplements and incentives for people. But the main thing has been we've had to use higher price contractors until we get all these positions filled. We aren't seeing the same kind of issues in Indonesia. And Richard mentioned, the Peru impacts with profit sharing. We just signed a new contract labor agreement, both in Indonesia and in Peru and the labor situation there is much easier than it is in the U.S. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw from Scotiabank. Orest Wowkodaw : Just following up on the outlook for costs. And specifically, I was wondering if there is a big lag impact on seeing higher cost flow through? And I don't know if that's from previous contracts that you may have for things for some of the input costs like explosives and fuel? And whether there's still, I guess, this lagging impact that we should see -- if current costs stay where they are, whether we could see a fairly significant rise in your cost base as we approach closer to the end of this year? Richard Adkerson : That's really not a significant factor. I mean there may be a short-term contract that gets renegotiated. But costs -- the cost you see are essentially the current costs that we're experiencing now. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. And we -- so the outlook that you have reflects our current estimate. Each quarter, we update all of our operating plans and cost input. So what you're seeing in the latest outlook for the year is based on the market prices when we prepare this forecast just recently. Richard Adkerson : And while there's uncertainties, my expectation is we're facing kind of the height of dislocations from global supply chains to other factors. COVID shutdown in China and situation in Ukraine, so my personal expectation is rather than seeing costs going up in the future, we'll see them come down. But time will tell. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Hacking from Citi. Alex Hacking : Can you hear me? Richard Adkerson : We can. Alex Hacking : Okay. Sorry. Sorry, Richard, I had a problem with my handset there. So let me just play devil's advocate on the growth side. If you look at your production profile, it does peak in 2023 with some declines in '24-'25 in Grasberg and elsewhere, bag that leaching opportunities, are these -- are these more of keeping the production at the current 4.5 billion pound level? Or can they really kind of generate a growth CAGR? And here, I guess I'm setting aside the multibillion dollar sulfide projects. Kathleen Quirk : In the near term, Alex, you're right. I mean in the near term, what we've got is these leach opportunities. And like I said, it takes 7, 10 years to build a new mine. And -- so these leach opportunities really can fill in the near term.  Longer term, we're really looking at growth coming from this big potential we have at Lone Star and also El Abra. We hadn't made a decision on El Abra yet, but that 700 million pounds-plus of new production and the Lone Star sulfide would be a meaningful amount of increase as well.  But -- I mean, it's a feature of other copper market. It's very, very challenging to develop new supplies, and it takes many years to do it. We've had significant growth in 2021, again in 2022, but it's not common in our industry to see that kind of growth in copper production, and that's really what underpins the fundamental outlook for it. Richard Adkerson : And Alex, that's 1 thing I've been trying to get across to policymakers and others who follow our industry, just about how long term the copper business is. I participated in Cambridge Energies, the CERAWeek down in Houston with oil and gas companies, and everybody was asking the oil and gas companies about the time for response to production, and they were talking about it, the executives with the energy companies were saying, \"Well, it's a long-term business. It takes months to respond.\"  And I said, \"Well, copper takes years to respond.\" And so that's why I pointed out at Grasberg, and there was a lot of pressure on us to -- for periods of time to delay development of the Grasberg underground, as we were talking with the Government of Indonesia about our contract rights. But had we done that, we wouldn't have had this production available to us.  And so what we're looking at when we talk about growth, is growth from a very long-term basis. And it's one of the reasons why we have a favorable copper price, and why, I believe copper prices are going to go higher. I mean we're seeing companies across our energy industry today being challenged with meeting their production targets.  We've done that. But it's going -- all of that's going to be supportive of prices. And as I said, I'm really struck by having today's copper price in the kind of global market with headwinds that would normally lead to lower prices. Alex Hacking : Great. And congrats on being one of the few in the copper industry that's actually hitting your production targets. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lawson Winder from Bank of America Securities. Lawson Winder : If I could maybe ask on capital allocation and M&A. One of your partners in Cerro Verde recently divested of its minority interest in another gold mine in Peru. And it just got me wondering that with Freeport, would you guys be open to increasing your interest in Cerro Verde, should the opportunity emerge? And I'm asking particularly in light of the political situation there. Richard Adkerson : Yes. We would. It's just such a great asset. Funny historical story before the Phelps Dodge deal. I called the Phelps Dodge CEO when he sold down originally interest in Cerro Verde. At a time when they needed production, and I said, \"What are you doing?\" I wish they had kept greater production. We got great partners. But yes, it's such a great long-term asset, and those kinds of quality of assets are really, really scarce in our business. And while that's a project that we can enhance growth at the margin, it's not a project where there's going to be a step-change change in volumes in the future. We've got some leaching opportunities there. We can be more efficient. We can overcome some of the issues that COVID has caused us, but it's just a great long-term asset with our positive view of the copper markets. We're glad we have it, and we wish we own more. Lawson Winder : Okay. That's fantastic. And if I could maybe just sneak in a follow-up question, if you don't mind? But just in terms of the total capital return this quarter, I mean it appears to be in excess of 50% of available cash flow, maybe I'm looking at available cash flow incorrectly. But I mean, if this is the case, is that something you could expect to continue going forward or just something that was sort of even out over time? Kathleen Quirk : Yes. We're looking at it on an annual basis, really, and we had a big working capital item in the first quarter. And so we're not varying our returns on our working capital change like that, that's not expected to continue through the year. So really, it's a -- we're looking at it as an annual, and we're having to make some estimates and that kind of thing. But it's -- we're trying to have some consistency in the share buyback program. Richard Adkerson : Yes. And the facts are because of these time challenges in pursuing investments with strong copper prices, cash is going to come in faster than it's going to go out. So that's something our Board is going to have -- will be considering going forward. And the 50% was a guidance for investors to understand what our thinking is, but it's not any sort of fixed in stone situation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Abhi Agarwal from Deutsche Bank. Abhinandan Agarwal : My first question is on Peru. So Peru is seeing a significant upheaval right now across several mines. Cerro Verde has been immune, thankfully, over the last 12 months or so. Have you seen any signs of disturbance at Cerro Verde given what's happened more recently? Richard Adkerson : No, not really. We've worked really hard with the local community in Arequipa and have established a positive relationship. We did some really important things in terms of community investment over the years. We built a freshwater system for the city and second largest city in Peru.  And then we developed a -- for a city that didn't have -- that was just dumping its wastewater into the River Chile, we developed a wastewater collection and processing facility. And so the ecology of the river has really improved, which has been very positive in many levels with agriculture interest and so forth. So we've done a lot. We pay people well. We managed through COVID effectively, and it was challenging. But fortunately, we have a really positive relationship with the local community, and we work hard to preserve that. Abhinandan Agarwal : If I could sneak in another one? So this is a question on the new leach technologies, which you and Kathleen discussed. You mentioned that it was -- it's very low capital intensity, which is great to hear. But the question I have is, in your view, how easy it is to implement it across other operations owned by other mining companies and a bit of a long shot here, but how much do you think it could increase overall production by globally? Richard Adkerson : Well, we're advancing. It's still early days. We're working with a group of different technologies. Some of it's proprietary, some of it's with outside contractors and some is in joint ventures with other companies in Latin America. So we're excited about it. But we haven't yet been able to forecast of what we believe will ultimately be a significant incremental production.  Kathleen mentioned 200 million pounds a year is a target we're currently working for, that's focused on our existing active leach stacks. But there's other opportunities if this works, as we anticipate it would with some old historical inactive leach stacks and potentially be an alternative to investments in concentrators to process sulfide ores.  So it's -- I get pumped up when I talk with our technical team about it, and they brief me on what's going on because of the excitement they're expressing. But we'll keep you informed, keep the market informed, as we're able to get more visibility about incremental production. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carlos De Alba from Morgan Stanley. Carlos De Alba : So a question is for me on Grasberg. I know that the changes weren't that significant, but if you could give us a bit more color on the sequence of changes that you guys experience in -- or that you project now in Grasberg, that would be great? And also, if you could comment if this might impact in any way your costs outlook or profile for the operation and therefore for the company? Richard Adkerson : No, these are just normal mine plan adjustments that come up as conditions change. When you look at the numbers from Grasberg, it looks like it's almost like an assembly line process, but we're constantly dealing with changes in geology and other conditions. But there's nothing unusual there, and it's certainly nothing that has a fundamental change in the low-cost operations there.  Mark Johnson is on the line, and he's our longtime head of operations there at Grasberg. And Mark, why don't you make a comment in response to this question. Mark Johnson : Yes, Richard, I think you addressed it pretty well. More specifically, in 2023, this little bit of a swap in metal production '23 to '24 was primarily due to Deep MLZ, where we continue to learn and apply the deposit-specific cadence parameters. And what we ended up doing is slowing down the cave advance a little bit going to the west, and that deferred a little bit of higher-grade metal from 2023 into 2024 and 2025. At the same time, we were able to increase our milling rate and the additional tons at the mills allows the mines to ramp up. And so that more or less offset any of the change that we made at Deep MLZ. Carlos De Alba : All right. Excellent. And then just on Cerro Verde, if I may, very quickly. When do you expect that you might get back to the 1 billion pound level of production? Kathleen Quirk : We're getting close to that this year. And next year, we expect to be -- and it changes modestly on the margin with grades, but we're getting close to the 1 billion pound mark this year, and we'll be there next year. We did -- in terms of the gold at Grasberg, we did experience some higher recoveries in the first quarter of this year, and we've increased our gold volumes slightly for the year for 2022. We haven't incorporated any of these increases in the out years. And so we do potentially have some benefits for gold as we look forward that we haven't incorporated, but we'll have to see how the experience goes as we go through this year. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas from Vertical Research Partners. Michael Dudas : Welcome, Maree. You're going to get this fun going forward. And Kathleen is not too quick to pass on. Anyway, so Richard, I was -- as you mentioned in your prepared remarks, the market price for copper is not listening investment demand or the supply response that I think you would have suspected other cycles.  I just want -- and you talked about some of the issues, but given that it's not just copper, but other metals, given the expectations on EV and net 0 is booming, it appears that mining investment may be constrained across the board, which is going to keep the pressure on pricing, how best to the market to signal to get more confidence in the marketplace if the price isn't similar and left out? Richard Adkerson : Well, I mean, there's just -- things are just piling up that's adding to the supply constraints. I mean that's a story 20 years ago when China emerged, there was a general expectation that there would be a major supply response, as there always had been in copper before that. But then people started looking hard, and it's been going on for 20 years now.  Copper has been at the top of the strategic objectives of the major mining companies ever since then. And it's a combination of geology, the quality of deposits are much, much lower than they were before. They're in much more challenging jurisdictions. Often, their grades are lower, many are underground, and so that's been a factor that's overriding everything.  And now with 40% of the copper coming from Chile and Peru and those companies -- countries going through political discussions about the direction of how they're going to be treating the industry, that's clearly a factor that's out there. And as things get delayed because of the amount of time that requires to develop even a straightforward project like this mill project, we have at Bagdad, that is about as simple project as you could have, but it's taken several years to get engineering and permit. It's just a question of building a new mill, building some tailings facilities. I mean there's nothing really that complicated. But when you start looking at projects that are really complicated, that are really in challenging jurisdictions, you can see around the world, communities opposing new developments, while we benefit in the U.S. because ours are brownfield, and we have good relationships with communities that we worked hard to keep, people who are trying to build new mines in the U.S. are running into really serious delays and sometimes brick walls about not being able to go forward. So these things are just pyramiding and absent some really significant global economic event, I'm just hard-pressed to see where we're not heading for an environment of where copper prices are going to be very high. And there's going to be real challenges as people try to substitute, get more scrap, develop new projects. All of those things have barriers. So as I said at the start, I'm really confident about our strategy of being a copper company. And I think we're really well suited to benefit for our stakeholders by being good at execution, as we've shown; by being focused; by doing things the right way; by building relationships. We mentioned Peru, same way in the U.S., same way in Indonesia. We learned long ago, and our experience in coming up and developing the Grasberg in Indonesia was you cannot turn a blind eye to the local people. You have to give them jobs, opportunities, benefits, and so we've learned those lessons and it's paying off for us. And I think it will continue to pay off for us. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Alex Terentiew from Stifel. Alexander Terentiew : I just wanted to circle back on some of these -- the growth options here. In particular, the Lone Star and El Abra, sulfides. I know these are long lead time projects. But is there any way you can kind of just lay out for us the time line or schedule? Or another way, is there any way you can kind of see these coming into production, say, within a decade?  And then also, you talked about El Abra 700 million pounds, I know the oxide is currently being mined effectively like a pre-strip. But do you think that -- would you have some overlap with the oxide leach and the sulfides or would it just basically transition to a sulfide operation? Richard Adkerson : Yes. Well, El Abra and Lone Star are different. And when we acquired Phelps Dodge 15 years ago, El Abra was viewed as a declining short-term asset. And it was through our explore to our drilling that we discovered there is large sulfide deposit, and it's very large, but it's at altitude, it requires desalinization, energy and so forth. So it would be an expensive project, but certainly one that would be economic with today's and current process.  And so it's just a question of seeing what Chile does and then doing all the work we have to do to get ready for it. The stripping side of things, and I'll let Josh say a couple of comments about it, is really what's happening at Lone Star, which is adjacent to our historical Safford mine just across the mountain ridge from Morenci. And again, a place where we have great community support to do what we're doing.  But there, we are expanding this oxide production, and it's serving as a stripping towards a sulfide resource that we're continuing to evaluate and sort through how to development. The 10-year -- Josh, why don't you make a couple of comments about it? Kathleen Quirk : I'll just comment on the portfolio there, just on the concurrent, we could have concurrent leach for a period of time at the El Abra alongside of the concentrating same as Lone Star. We have that in many of our operations, including Morenci, where we have concurrent leach operations and concentrating operations. And yes, to answer your question, these projects could be within the decade. But it takes a very long time as we've all been talking about on this call. Sorry to interrupt. Go ahead, Josh. Joshua Olmsted : Good morning, everybody. Just a few additional comments. I think Kathleen touched on it. I think we can get those projects would be able to be done within a decade, depending obviously on timing with respect to El Abra. As far as Lone Star, as you indicated in your question, the oxide stripping -- the oxide mining is really functioning as a stripping for the sulfide. One of the things that we continue to discover as we do additional drilling at Lone Star is that ore body is -- what I would classify as while not the same as Morenci, is going to be a district similar to Morenci in the sense that it will be a combination of leaching and milling sulfides as it goes forward and gets put into place. And so it would be a concurrent thing, concurrent operation and production of both, it wouldn't be a pure oxide then transitioning to a pure sulfide, but rather an ongoing combination of the 2, which will allow us to really maximize the value of the resource and the pounds on an annual basis. Operator : Now we will turn the call over to management for any closing remarks. Richard Adkerson : All right. Well, thanks, everybody, for your interest, and I'll just close and say I hope to see both Lone Star and El Abra's projects get kicked off. So that will give you some time frame on it. And we are really proud of our team and really feel good about where we are and where we're going. So thank you for your interest, and we look forward to reporting our progress in the future. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan second quarter conference call. Earlier this morning, FCX reported second quarter 2022 operating and financial results, and a copy of today's press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. On the call today with me are, Richard Adkerson, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Maree Robertson, our Chief Financial Officer; Mark Johnson, Chief Operating Officer of Indonesia; Josh Olmsted, Chief Operating Officer for the Americas; Mike Kendrick, who runs our molybdenum business; Cory Stevens, who leads our centralized technical services, engineering and construction; Rick Coleman, who's leading a number of our projects, including the smelter project in Indonesia; and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. Richard is going to make some opening comments to start us off, and then I'll come back and cover the materials in the slide presentation. So now I'll turn the call over to Richard for his comments. Richard Adkerson : Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'm going to open up with some brief remarks about where Freeport is as a company. The second quarter was truly a tale of 2 cities for Freeport. We had very strong operations, and then we've had to deal with this sudden and unexpected significant decline in copper prices. For our operations, we executed our plans. We met our production targets. We met our unit production cost target as well of $1.41. And that was really supported by the ongoing success we've had at Grasberg in the 20-year effort to convert the open pit mine to the industry's largest underground operations. Grasberg has now returned as the second largest copper mine in the world, the largest single gold mine in the world, is 38% of our consolidated copper sales at Freeport. Our second quarter unit cost at PT-FI were below 0. Our gold revenue is fully funded our total operating cost and the success in this operation is a highlight in the careers of all of us associated with PT-FI. Our operations in America performed well. We maintained our positive outlook. As Kathleen will illustrate, I just cannot be more pleased with our global team and the way we operate in the second quarter. We executed the financial policy we established early last year. At that time, we set a debt target of $3 billion to $4 billion and an allocation of available cash flows between dividends, share buybacks and investments. We ended the quarter with a comparative debt amount of $1 billion. There was $600 million of Indonesian debt to separately finance there. Our debt reduced to that level simply because we weren't able, for timing reasons, market reasons, to spend money on expansions in accordance with the allocation. We've paid our base dividend and our supplemental dividend. We purchased FCX shares in the open market since we began that program. We purchased 48 million shares. We retired $750 million of debt in the open market at a discount. Our Board has now approved an increase in our buyback program authorization to 5 billion shares. We have roughly 3 billion shares remaining. Our financial policy is solid, and our execution is strong. But that's only one city. But it's an important one. The other side of the coin is markets. It's just striking how quickly and dramatically markets changed in the second quarter. Prior to this call, I went back and read analyst comments going into the quarter, and the optimism was widespread. Copper prices approached $5. Many were expecting it to go higher. We used $4.50 in our outlook. And now we have prices just above $3.25. Market sentiment reversed so dramatically. I read with interest the recent Bank of America investor survey of institutional investors where they described it as a full panic mode, the lowest expectation in the history of the survey going back to 1995 by investors. The economic analysts are debating on how significant in deterioration of the downturn. At Freeport, we hope for the best, we prepare for the worst. Our management team has experienced and successfully managed past downturns, all of which have been followed by significant recoveries. This is not our first rodeo. We have our playbook. We've dealt with this before. But this time, importantly, we have a strong balance sheet, and that will enable us to manage whatever we face in this marketplace. Our strong financial -- we will work to protect our strong financial condition, protect our assets, our growth opportunities for the bright future that lies ahead for copper. There is a disconnect in today's physical market and the current copper price. Our world in producing and selling copper, for us, feels about the same it did when copper was at $4.50. Customers report strong business. Copper inventories are at historical lows. There has been, to date, no significant impact in physical demand. Today's market is tight. Our strategy of being the world's foremost copper company is intact, and that's based on the long-term fundamentals of the demand and supply for copper. But the reality of today's copper price stares us squarely in the face. It's a major impact on our revenues and our cash flows. The outlook is uncertain. Analysts are calling in a range from a near-term major recession to a longer-term stagflation. Some see a less significant downturn with a near-term recovery. If that happens, we'll watch out. We at Freeport do not know what's going to happen near term. As I said, we hope for the best, prepare for the worst. Whatever happens, the long-term outlook for copper is bright. FCX is well positioned to be a major beneficiary. This -- the world is becoming increasingly electrified with the demand for copper growing as the world acts to reduce carbon emissions with electric vehicles and alternative power generations. S&P Global's Dan Yergin, a highly respected authority for many years in the energy business, recently published a report according to a doubling of copper demand because of the energy transition by 2035, accompanied by huge deficits. I encourage you to read this report. With the established need for the copper to support the world's economy, the future global growth, we're in a new era of copper demand with the energy transitions. Supplies for new copper are challenged. There is no clear line of sight for mine development to meet future demand. The result is, there has to be more scrap recovery, has to be conservation of substitution, more mines and expansions, more mines to develop expansions. But all of this takes years to execute, as you can see from our company. The results will be higher copper prices. The current price for copper is unsustainable. Absent a global long-term economic collapse, that is simply inevitable. And now Kathleen, I'll let you review the quarter and present the information we have in our slides. Kathleen Quirk : Okay. Great. Thank you, Richard, and I'll cover the presentation that's on our website, and then we'll come back and take your questions. Starting on Slide 3, we summarized the highlights of the second quarter. We achieved solid operating performance in the quarter and continued our momentum and executing our operating plans, growing our production year-over-year and managing costs in a challenging environment. Our sales volumes for copper were 17% higher than last year's second quarter and 5% above our recent guidance. We benefited from strong operating performance across the portfolio. Gold sales were 56% above the year ago quarter and 18% above our April guidance, reflecting the exceptional performance at Grasberg. Our consolidated average unit net cash cost for the quarter of $1.41 per pound were in line with our guidance. And notably, Grasberg's costs were a net credit of $0.02 per pound in the quarter, meaning that the gold revenues more than offset all of our cash production cost at the site. We're actively engaged in cost management and efficiencies across the portfolio to mitigate cost increases. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $2.3 billion in the quarter. This was net of a $355 million reduction associated with copper sales recorded in the first quarter, provisionally priced at the end of March at $4.71 per pound, which remains subject to final settlement. The decline in copper prices during the second quarter resulted in a negative adjustment for these provisionally priced sales. Our adjusted net income totaled $854 million in the second quarter, $0.58 per share. That excluded net charges detailed on Roman numeral Page 7 of our earnings release, totaling $0.01 per share. Operating cash flows of $1.6 billion in the quarter exceeded our capital expenditures of roughly $900 million. Capital spending during the quarter included $400 million of major projects, principally associated with the Grasberg underground and roughly $200 million to advance the construction of the Indonesian smelter. We took advantage of weakness in credit markets during the quarter and opportunistically repurchased debt in the open market. To date, we have purchased $754 million of FCX's notes in open market transactions at a cost of $718 million, including $582 million in principal amount in the second quarter. The current market situation provides a great opportunity for us to reduce absolute debt levels at attractive prices. We also continue to execute our share repurchase program since starting the program last November, we have purchased 48 million shares at a total cost of $1.8 billion, an average approximating $38 per share. Since the end of the first quarter, we purchased nearly 800 million in stock, including 110 million in July, which were executed at an average share price of $28 per share. Since reaching our net debt target in the middle of last year in the range of $3 billion to $4 billion, we have used approximately 50% of our free cash flow for shareholder returns. Today, we announced that our Board increased our share purchase authorization by $2 billion to refresh availability on the program to the $3 billion range. The timing of our future purchases will be dependent on our cash flows and general market conditions. We'll continue our priority of maintaining a strong balance sheet and use excess cash to return to shareholders. As Richard discussed, the magnitude of the decline in copper in recent weeks was sudden and unexpected. We have the balance sheet, asset quality and experience to successfully manage a volatile and uncertain market environment. Our net debt at the end of June was $1.6 billion. That included $600 million in net debt associated with the Indonesian smelter. Consolidated debt was $11.1 billion, and consolidated cash was $9.5 billion. We don't have requirements to raise capital in the current environment. We've been opportunistic and taking advantage of recent market weakness to repurchase our debt and equity securities. As we look forward, we will manage through the near term effectively and are positive about our strategy centered on being foremost in copper, the strength of our assets and our team focused on increasing value for all stakeholders. Moving to markets on Slide 4, we show a graph of year-to-date copper prices. The price 4 months ago hit a high of $4.87 per pound, with market analysts predicting multiyear periods of price increases based on fundamentals of rising demand required to support the energy transition, limited supplies and sizable deficits on the horizon. You've all read about the macro factors, which have manifested over the last several weeks, triggering recessionary concerns. In addition, concerns about the impact of COVID shutdowns in China and a strong U.S. dollar have weighed on copper, which is viewed as a close proxy for sentiment on the health of the global economy. The reality is that this has been a financially driven anticipatory move in copper prices. Physical markets remain healthy as evidenced by the global exchange inventories illustrated on this chart, which remain at historically low levels. Our customers report solid orders, and the industry continues to struggle to meet production targets. The current decline in price is below Wood Mackenzie's estimate of $4.25 per pound necessary to incentivize new supply under an accelerated energy transition. It will also provide less cash flow to the industry to develop new supplies, making the projected deficits in copper more significant in the future. The long-term secular demand trends for copper demand associated with electrification, decarbonization will be important demand drivers for copper. We see these trends being less economically sensitive than traditional uses of copper in the economy. We fully recognize the short-term uncertainties but have conviction about long-term fundamentals for the copper markets. Richard mentioned the S&P Global report. Many of you have seen it was published last week, prepared by analysts at S&P Global and led by Dan Yergin, a well-known energy industry expert, author and historian. The independent study, which is available on S&P Global's website, forecast above-trend copper demand through 2035 associated with electrification and the energy transition. The report projects long-term structural deficits in copper and highlights copper's prominent role in the global aspirations of a net zero economy. It confirms the work of other reputable analysts on the future of copper and will serve as an educational tool for governments and other policymakers on the importance of future new copper supply development. We recognize the short-term macro was a different picture. And as we move to Slide 6, Richard highlighted this, it summarizes our experience in managing challenging environments. For those of you who have followed our company and industry for a long time, you know that our team is proficient and successfully navigating challenging circumstances. This slide on Slide 6 summarizes our actions in prior periods when we took decisive steps to adjust our operating plans, reduce costs, defer spending, protect liquidity and preserve our asset values for improved market conditions. Notably, we operate all of our mines and manage major capital and operating decisions centrally. Each one of these periods had its own unique challenges, and our team proved its agility each time. We're prepared to respond to a weakening market environment, if necessary. We're in a much stronger position than in past downturns with a significantly improved balance sheet and our successful expansion of a low-cost production at Grasberg. Our team is resilient, experienced, professional and value-driven in our approach. We can't predict the extent or timeframe of the current situation. But as a responsible producer of scale and a strategy focused on copper with long life reserves, the prospects are bright for our portfolio to become more scarce and highly valued in the future. On Slide 7, we provide some additional details on our operating activities in the quarter. In the U.S., the Lone Star mine continues to perform above design capacity. We're expanding further to take us to 300 million pounds per annum by 2023 with an investment of approximately $250 million. As we accelerate the mining of oxide awards, this will expose a much larger sulfide opportunity at this site. We're also advancing and we're very excited about our leach recovery initiatives at Morenci; and across the Americas portfolio, using data analytics and new technologies to enhance our leach production. This is a significant value-enhancing opportunity for us, and we continue to gain momentum and expect to have success on this priority initiative. At our Bagdad mine in Northwest Arizona, we are advancing plans for the Bagdad 2X project to double production. Studies are advancing, and we're planning to advance early initiatives in parallel with the studies. We're focusing on developing this opportunity. It's a future growth option, but we'll be flexible on timing subject to market conditions. In South America, the teams have done exceptional work navigating the pandemic. We've had a great highlight a significant milestone for the Cerro Verde team during the quarter, setting a quarterly record for concentrating of averaging 427,000 tonnes of concentrating per day. At Cerro Verde, we also had some recent positive results on exploration, which has the potential to expand reserves and increase grades at this large-scale operation. At El Abra, we have increased stacking rates and commencing leaching on a new leach pad. We continue to evaluate alternatives for the long term at El Abra, including options for a new concentrator or an extension of existing operations, subject to ongoing monitoring of the investment climate in Chile. At Grasberg, we sustained our large-scale metal production after reaching our target metal run rate in the fourth quarter of last year. The cost position at Grasberg is exceptional. And the team there is doing outstanding work in managing and sustaining the largest and most profitable underground operation in the world. During the quarter, we again achieved higher gold recoveries compared with forecasts, which contributed to a favorable variance for the quarter. And we've now increased our outlook for full year gold production. At PT-FI, we are advancing mill projects to provide additional capacity in the second half of 2023. We're diversifying our power sources and advancing the long-term development for Kucing Liar. The construction of the new smelter in Indonesia is advancing. We reached an important construction milestone during the quarter, which will enable us to begin to reduce export duties later this year. Turning to Slide 8, we provide a 3-year outlook for our volumes, which are largely in line with our prior forecast. We've made small changes to our 2022 copper volumes totaling about 40 million pounds or about 1% and have increased our forecast for gold volumes in 2022 by about 5%. The execution of our long-term plans is on track after delivering 19% increase in copper sales in 2021. We are projecting growth in volumes in 2022 and further growth in 2023. For 2022, we estimate 36% of our sales volumes will come from the U.S., 27% from South America and 37% from Grasberg. Moving to our cost outlook on Slide 9. As I mentioned, we're actively engaged in cost management and efficiency initiatives to mitigate the impacts of the challenging cost environment. We've updated our plans to incorporate recent commodity pricing, exchange rates and our latest operating plans. We're now estimating unit net cash costs for the year approximating $1.50 per pound for 2022. That compares with our prior estimate of $1.44 per pound. As you'll see from the reconciliation on Slide 9, the majority of this increase reflects the decline in by-product credits associated with a reduction in assumed gold and molybdenum prices for the balance of the year. Our projected $0.03 per pound increase in site production and delivery costs reflects the assumption of higher energy prices in our second half -- in the second half compared with our prior forecast, higher consumable costs, together with the impact of a change in estimate for copper in the maturing leach pad at El Abra. And this was partly offset by the favorable impact we have on labor costs internationally associated with weakening exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollar. Historically, copper prices have been correlated with a number of our input costs. Should recessionary pressures continue, historical correlations would indicate that we may begin to see a reversal of some of the cost experiences we've seen over the last 2 years. Moving to Slide 10. As one of the world's leading copper producers, our earnings and cash flows have significant leverage to the price of copper, up and down. On Slide 10, we show modeled results for our EBITDA and cash flow at various prices and have shown a broad range of prices this quarter, given the volatility ranging from $3 per pound of copper to $5 per pound of copper, which is close to where the prices were earlier in the year. We've updated our gold and molybdenum prices to reflect current prices. As Richard talked about, the current price is not sustainable long term given the cost structure of the industry and the need for new supply development in the future. We show modeled results on this slide using the average of 2023 and 2024 with current volume and cost estimates and holding gold flat at $1,700 per ounce and molybdenum at $16 per pound. Our annual EBITDA under these scenarios would range from over $6 billion per annum at $3 copper to $15 billion per year at $5 copper, with operating cash flows ranging from $4.5 billion per year at $3 copper to over $11 billion per year at $5 of copper. We show sensitivities on the right to various commodities and input costs. We can't predict prices and are prepared to manage in a low price environment. The long-term fundamentals of our business indicate that low copper prices are not sustainable longer term, providing increased cash flow as market conditions improve. We show the consolidated capital expenditures on Slide 11. These are largely unchanged from our prior guidance. We've reduced the 2022 capital forecast by $100 million, which is a timing variance for 2023. And as you probably noted, we've been spending capital during 2022 at a slower pace than our original plans. And in the current weak environment, we'll review opportunities to defer spending as we've done in the past. We have flexibility with our plans and benefit from the fact that the major investments required for the Grasberg transition are largely behind us and will begin to decline as we go into 2023. On Slide 12, we show our future growth options embedded in our asset base. We have multiple options for brownfield low-risk growth across our portfolio. Recall, we have 191 billion pounds of copper mineral resources in our portfolio in addition to our proved and probable reserves of 107 billion pounds of copper. The leaching opportunity is a major value driver opportunity for us, and it's not included in our reserves and resources. Success in this area will enable us to create the equivalent of a new mine with extremely low capital intensity, low incremental operating costs and, importantly, a low carbon footprint. We're continuing to apply covers to our leach stockpiles as the retention of heat is proven to enhance recoveries. We're using data analytics and evaluating various additives that can further enhance recoveries. We're initially targeting the addition of 100 million to 200 million pounds of new copper per annum within a relatively short time frame and believe we can build on this target with initial success. We currently estimate 38 billion pounds of copper in our stockpiles, which has already been mined but not in our reserves or production plans. A significant portion of this opportunity is at our flagship Morenci mine, the largest mine in North America. A cross-functional team of technical experts, metallurgists, mine planners, data scientists, geologists and business analysts are working together to make -- take full advantage of this exciting opportunity. We review the ongoing oxide expansion at Lone Star, which is progressing on schedule. Longer term, we have the massive Lone Star sulfide opportunity, a 50 billion-pound copper resource in our established mining area in Eastern Arizona. This project is right in our wheelhouse and is a valuable development option for the future. In the medium term, we're planning to double the size of Bagdad. We have a very large reserve position at the site. We expect to complete the feasibility study for this project in the first half of next year and would be positioned to start construction activities as market conditions warrant. The El Abra project has a resource approaching 30 billion pounds of copper, and we've done a lot of work in identifying an operation that could produce over 700 million pounds of copper per year. In parallel with our evaluation of a major expansion, we're also considering investments in water, which would extend the life of the existing operation while maintaining the longer-term growth option. We continue to closely monitor developments in Chile and are deferring decisions for the time being. In Indonesia, Kucing Liar project is a natural extension of our operations there and will allow us to continue large-scale, low-cost mining there for decades to come. The learnings and shared infrastructure from our successful development of Grasberg underground and the Deep MLZ really enhanced the value of this project at Kucing Liar. We benefit from having a large pipeline of options and have flexibility on the timing of development of our projects, particularly the extensive options we have for development of new supply in the U.S., where we own most of our land and feed. We believe the world is going to need our projects in the future. We have a long track record of success in qualifying and developing projects in an efficient and responsible manner, enhanced by our industry-leading technical capabilities, established licenses to operate in our strong franchises in the areas of focus. I want to turn to our balance sheet on Slide 13, which our financial policy is centered around or center around a strong balance sheet. The actions we've taken in the past have placed us in an exceptionally strong position, particularly in the context of current market weakness. We don't have a need to raise new capital for the foreseeable future. During the quarter, we took a number of steps which further derisked our balance sheet. We raised long-term financing for the smelter. We repaid our term loans at PT-FI and Cerro Verde, and expanded our bank credit facilities for these subsidiaries, and we opportunistically purchased over 750 in senior notes at attractive prices. As we talked about, our net debt including $11 billion in total debt and $9.5 billion of cash. Net debt, excluding the smelter net debt was $1 billion and below our targeted net debt of $3 billion to $4 billion, providing cushion in a weak market environment. We have an attractive debt maturity profile, as you'll see, with easily manageable maturities. We can continue to be opportunistic on value opportunities to repurchase debt in the open market. Slide 14, in closing, we show a scorecard of our shareholder returns, which have increased with our strong financial performance in recent quarters. We were active in the market in the second quarter and into July and have allocated approximately 50% of excess cash flows to shareholder returns since the third quarter of last year. And that consisted of $1.8 billion in share repurchases and common stocks of over -- common stock dividends totaling over $650 million during this period. Our Board authorized a $2 billion increase in our share repurchase program to restore $3 billion in availability under the program. We'll continue to prioritize our balance sheet as the cornerstone of our financial policy, and that will allow us to operate well in varying market conditions and drive long-term returns for shareholders. The discretionary purchases of our shares will be dependent on market conditions and cash flow generation in the future, and our Board will continue to review our financial policy on a regular basis. In summary, we're all focused on long-term value and executing our plans responsibly, safely and efficiently. Despite the recent market conditions, we're optimistic about the value of our assets, the strength of our global team, the fundamentals of the copper business and the future prospects for the markets we serve. We appreciate your attention, and we look forward to your questions. Operator, we'll now open the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs. Emily Chieng : Good morning, Richard and Kathleen, and thank you for the update this morning. My first question is just around the 3Q copper shipment guidance. It looks like that's a little bit lower on a sequential basis than 2Q before it moves back up again. But could you perhaps point to what region may be driving that? And is that timing of shipments or perhaps something to do with the mine plan for the third quarter? Kathleen Quirk : Emily, it's primarily timing. We did sell more in the second quarter. We produced more, but we also had some timing variances in second quarter where we sold more in the U.S. than we expected. In Indonesia, we also brought down our concentrate inventory. So it's mainly a timing, we're at -- we're pretty much at run rates currently. Richard Adkerson : And anyway, we do have challenges with timing in Indonesia from time to time with the shallow water port that we have there. Rough seas can just delay loading and we, of course, record sales at the time of loading. And so that's just something we've had to deal with over the years. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Chris LaFemina : Hi, Richard and Kathleen. Thank you for taking my question. Kathleen, you mentioned historically, you mentioned your ability to kind of manage through the downturn, deferring spending as one option. Historically, Freeport in declining price environment has taking high-cost capacity offline. And like we had a lot of cost inflation in mining, the cost curve appears to be steepening pretty dramatically. I'm wondering how much further the price would have to fall before you would consider taking some capacity off-line. That's my first question. Kathleen Quirk : I think, Chris, what we're really looking at is the physical markets. And right now, the physical markets are tight. As Richard talked about earlier, inventories are low. We certainly do not want to produce at a loss at any of our operations, and we prefer to keep our reserves in the ground for better markets in the future. But right now, the situation is so dynamic, it appears that physical markets continue to be robust. We're going to be watching it. And it will be a combination of factors, including what input costs do as well. But we go through mine by mine and look at overall production costs capital costs, the overall cash flows, and we'll make adjustments as needed and maybe first adjustments be to defer some capital projects which do have an impact on copper prices -- on copper volumes longer term, but we're going to be looking at all these things and closely monitoring the conditions. As I mentioned, we're we operate everything. So we control all these decisions, and we can look very quickly across the portfolio and where things stand. And so we're prepared to make adjustments. I don't want to give a projection as to what number, but we have reduced copper production in the past, particularly when demand has fallen. Chris LaFemina : And you talked about the market being physically tight. You can see that in the inventory data. It's a little bit perplexing though, because the Chinese macro got so bad in the second quarter due to the lockdowns. And presumably, Chinese demand materially weakened. The underlying demand must have materially weakened there. There's been year-over-year in the second quarter fairly substantial supply growth on the 2 biggest mines in the world, including your own, had pretty big production growth year-over-year. A lot of companies are lowering their production guidance. But second quarter looks like a quarter where you had an increase in supply and potentially a collapse in Chinese demand, yet inventories didn't really change. So I'm just trying to reconcile what might have happened. Do you think the Chinese may be buying copper for strategic reserves? Or is there something else going on in the market that would explain why it's staying relatively tight despite the biggest end market potentially seemingly imploding in the last quarter? Richard Adkerson : Well, Chris, in preparing for this call, I have made a concerted effort with my contacts in the industry, who are very knowledgeable of the business on the ground in China. To answer your direct question there because that was perplexing out. I inquired broadly about where their inventories in China that were not visible, what was going on with Chinese commodity trading companies, and the word came back that inventories were not building, it wasn't unusual trading. You're right, a couple of our mine and the other big mines increased, but there was also fly disruptions in Latin America during the quarter. And it appears that, that, in effect, balanced some of the Chinese demand issues. But we don't see our customers in China -- and we have a diverse customer base in Asia. We, by design, don't sell all of our copper into China, but into Japan and South Korea and Taiwan, and we don't see any impact on demand. So I understand your question, and I just want to share with you what I've been able to find from it, but we're just not seeing it in our business. Kathleen Quirk : Western world has been strong as well, Chris. So that's been different than in past years. Richard Adkerson : Right. Even in Europe, our business there is strong. And I know the uncertainty space in Europe over this energy situation, so I'm not diminishing any of that. It's just our business is strong, as many customers over there are avoiding Russian copper. And so it is unusual, as I talked about. It is a disconnect. It's a serious disconnect right now between the physical marketplace that we're seeing and what's going on with copper prices. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of David Gagliano with BMO Capital Markets. David Gagliano : Chris just hit the one I was really trying to -- I wanted to ask about, which is the cadence. I know if you look back historically, '08, '09, I believe if memory serves me correctly, copper prices went to like $1.50 when Freeport acted. And then 2015, 2016, again, off the top of my head, I think copper prices were kind of in the somewhere $2 to $2.50 range. So given the cost pressures that we've seen everywhere, is it reasonable is sort of a $2.50 to $3 per pound range a reasonable zone to start thinking about when we'll see more action at existing assets? Richard Adkerson : Well, in response to your question earlier and we had about that, I think everyone understands that we at Freeport have a broad range of operations with different cost structures. I mean that was really the whole basis for putting together Grasberg with the Phelps Dodge assets. It allows us to manage those assets more efficiently when you've got a asset like Grasberg to support it. When times get tough, historically, what we've done has been able to use Grasberg support all of our corporate G&A and our debt financing cost. And then we challenge each one of mines to operate as they minimum cash flow breakeven. And we review this mine by mine, and every mine makes that decision, our decisions to support achieving that objective. But then within the larger mines -- and I'll just use Morenci as an example, the largest mine in North America. They are individual mines, but what goes on in to reflect the current economics. It's a balancing act because decisions you make to do that have consequence -- manage all these operations ourselves, and we run our business in the Americas essentially as a single business unit. So we all get together, we find out what's working, what's not, what can be done, what -- and we balance the longer-term consequences with the need to meet current realities. And it is -- and as I said, we have the same basic team we've had that we've done this before. so we have a game plan for us doing it. And now our operators are ahead of us in occasions. Everybody knows what to do. Everybody is pitching in and acting as a team to deal with our corporate objectives. So it's not an easy question to say, is there a price where this happens with this mine, because it's an interactive process that cuts across all of our mines in the Americas. Of course, in Indonesia, we're going to produce as aggressively as we can safely and consistent with our long-term plans. And it's so great now to be ramped up to the extent we obviously got a couple of steps to do. But just 2 years ago, it was really scary when we were having volumes down there and the world was facing COVID. And we're so much better positioned now. Kathleen Quirk : And David, you raised this in your comments, and we look at a lot of the publications that show where cost support is for copper. Those estimates are dated. There've been a lot of changes in input costs that the historical cost support for copper has been increased significantly. So $3.25 copper is not the same as it was 2 years ago. And so that's a factor as well. But reading tea leaves about how long this will last, we can move quickly. This has happened suddenly, and we're starting a process to look at what we can do, particularly on the capital spend. That's the quickest way to increase cash flow. David Gagliano : Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. Obviously, the authorization increased the buyback from $3 billion to $5 billion at a time when copper is dropping. If copper kind of holds where it is, we don't see a lot of free cash flow, which, by the way, is no different from a company that reported last night that also raised their buyback. My question is just really, can you just speak to the thought process and the approach to the buyback moving forward, considering everything else that's going on in the market right now. Is there any -- and also, is there any kind of duration to the $5 billion buyback timeline-wise? Richard Adkerson : So what we try to do at urging of a number of our shareholders last year was established a financial policy so that people knew what direction we were going in. And so we worked on it for months and finally came up with a policy that was announced about how we were allocating available cash flows, what was our debt targets, how are we allocating cash flows between shareholder returns and investments. There's always a challenge in the investment side of it because it takes so long to do it. So anyway, that's just part of the function. But we felt that -- and we discussed this with our Board, we felt that it was best to give the marketplace a direction since we've executed so much of our existing authorization, that we would have the availability to act for share buybacks when it was warranted by the marketplace. And I would be careful to say this because I'm not predicting anything. I mean clearly, my long career has taught me not to be confident in myself or others in predicting these short-term movements. But David, there is a scenario here with the market being so tight. And if things turn out not to be as dire as most expect now, there could be a dramatic recovery in copper prices, and that would translate to a recovery in Freeport's share price. And we want people to understand what we'd be prepared to do if the circumstances changed dramatically from where they are now or for most to predict. We're still going to run the business with the primary goal of protecting our assets and protecting our future because we believe the future -- we believe we're confident the future of this company is so bright Past actions by the company that they impair all at times. We're not going to do that this time. We're going to have discipline about it. But we wanted the market to know that we have this authorization available to us for us to execute when it makes sense. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. I think another factor out there is, as you look at the copper price needed to support new mine development and compare that to where our share is trading and what's implied in our shares, it's attractive versus new supply development. And on the flip side, we are looking at this steering the situation in the face where new supply development is required. So there's some bunch of disconnects in the market right now. And we wanted to signal positive we're going to use excess cash flows to buy stock back. We've -- the lower copper prices gives us less cash flows to use, but we're going to continue to look at our plans and see how we might modify that with this disconnect in where our share price is trading and what's needed long term to develop new supplies. Richard Adkerson : I mean maybe it's trite because most management say this, but our management and our Board truly believes that the fundamental value of Freeport is substantially higher than the stocks trading now. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Lawson Winder with Bank of America Securities. Lawson Winder : Hello, Richard and Kathleen. It is very nice to hear from you. As always I hope you both are well. I just wanted to kind of dig down on your comments regarding the increase in the cash cost guidance, Kathleen, you mentioned it was a majority of the forces driving that were actually just a reduction in the by-product price assumptions. I was getting to that too, though, I was getting to a very small majority, almost close to 50-50. We happen to have a specific number in terms of how that broke down between inflation and the change in the price assumption? And then maybe if you could just speak to some of the key, I guess, unexpected inflationary items that you saw in the quarter. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. Sure. On Slide 9, we show a roll forward. And you can see there where we've gone from $1.44 to $1.50 in the by-product credit because we're using lower gold prices and moly from what we used in our prior forecast is down by $0.05. So we had a $0.06 increase and $0.05 of that is from reduced by-product credits. The site production, the top line number, the site production delivery being up $0.03. The major factors there that are impacting our cost guidance is energy we used -- just for reference in our last forecast, we used $3.50 per gallon for diesel prices just for one reference in our outlook, which was the price -- around the price at the time. The price in the fourth -- in the second quarter ended up being above $4 per gallon, and that's declined somewhat to $3.70. So we're using current or at least prices as of last week for oil prices or diesel prices roughly $3.70 a pound or a gallon in our outlook. Coal prices are also up from our prior forecast. Purchase power costs are up slightly. We had some offsets in currencies. The stronger dollar results in lower operating costs in our international locations. And so we've reflected that. We've had some contractual consumable price increases, which are rolling in, which we've brought into the forecast. We had also -- and this is more of an accounting deal, but we also had, as we are transitioning in a lab from a former leach pad to a new leach pad, we had some changes in estimates in our estimates of what copper is remaining in that leach pad. And so what that does is basically, if we reduce the amount of copper available in leach pad, it increases our costs for the remaining pound. So that is not a cash item. It's essentially we've already spent the cash. But it will roll through our unit net cash costs and that was a factor as well. So -- but the headlines, energy materials and supplies, this deal at El Abra, which is more noise offset by a stronger dollar. And profit sharing and other costs that are driven by copper prices. So net of all that, we were $0.03 on site production and delivery, and our export duties and royalties went down by $0.02. So the biggest factor you can look at this and say it's by-product credits, which we were using $1,950 for gold in the prior forecast and now we're using $1,700, $19 for moly in the prior forecast, which is what it was. And that price has declined to $16. Richard Adkerson : And growing volumes in Indonesia. I mean, with that cost structure, when it gets to be a greater proportion of consolidated numbers, that's a huge benefit. Lawson Winder : Maybe as a follow-up, I find it remarkable that you did not mention labor among all of that. Are you just not seeing signs of any meaningful labor inflation? And I guess, you're obviously confident that you don't expect to see any going forward? Kathleen Quirk : We had already updated in our second quarter -- in the second quarter and our first quarter results in April, we had already updated our labor costs for inflation. We've also -- in contract labor that we're using. Our labor costs actually in this forecast are a little lower because of this currency factor that I mentioned. And that doesn't affect our U.S. operations. But when you look at South America and where the Peruvian and Chilean currencies have moved relative to the dollar, that helps because our costs are in those countries for labor are principally denominated in the local currency. Richard Adkerson : I want to get a shout out to our supply chain team that's just done a remarkable job in working with our suppliers in a difficult environment, not only from a cost standpoint, but from a delivery standpoint. And they've just done a great job in working directly hand-in-hand with our operations to do what we can to offset these challenges that are broadly across all businesses. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Carlos De Alba : Yes, good morning, Richard and Kathleen. A couple of questions, if I may. First one, it seems that the leaching technology could be a very attractive return on investment for you. So I wonder if you can give maybe a little bit more color as to what is the current status there? What are some of the work that is still pending to do? And if you have any sense of potential timing for that investment to materialize? And then the other is, clearly a lot of volatility, as you mentioned, and copper prices have suffered. But since you are quite constructive on the market, this might be an opportunity. So this is maybe a sensitive topic, but what is the rationale of keeping Cerro Verde as a policy traded company? I mean wouldn't it potentially be that also a good investment for Freeport shareholders? Kathleen Quirk : Carlos, regarding the first question related to your comments on leaching, it is our best project in the portfolio and is something that's a catalyst for us to really add value to our business. As you mentioned, low capital intensity, very low operating costs. And particularly in this current environment, we are highly motivated. We've got teams, we're running it like a project. We've got teams highly focused on this. It's our #1 priority. It's got an element of research and development associated with it. So it's not just execution. It's got some science associated with it. But we are advancing our understanding of the science. We -- our company and its predecessors have been really leaders in this area, and we've got a team of people who have a lot of experience in the science of this as well as some new approaches that are going to allow us to be successful here. Cory Stevens is on the line, who is leading this effort and with Josh and the whole Americas team. And Cory, I don't know if you want to make any comments in addition to what we said earlier. But Cory's phone rings quite a bit because this is -- we do see this as being a real value opportunity for us to create value for our business and shareholders. But Cory, is there anything you want to add that wasn't covered? Cory Stevens : No. Thanks, Kathleen. Yes. So reaching really does offer a number of compelling advantages on a number of fronts. The analytics capabilities is really unlocking a more granular look at all the different aspects that we see in terms of recovery, and it's enabling us to decouple static recipes that we had in the past to more dynamic recipes that maximize value as we go forward. But that's just one bucket and it's very organic. We're -- at Morenci, there's a lot of a center of our attention right now. We're executing to the moderate volumes that we've put in to this year's forecast, building confidence into a sustainable -- what that looks like going forward and then have a number of activities going to add even more with a whole -- with a very large backlog of a number of alternatives that we're pursuing. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, Cory. And so it's data analytics, additives, which we're exploring as well as heat, which we're applying covers across all of our stockpiles. And we're well on our way to doing that. And as we retain heat in the stockpile, the data shows that recoveries are greater. So it's a multifaceted approach to it. We're focused initially at Morenci. Chino is the second largest one in the U.S., and we're moving with data analytics there. We're trying out some additives at Sierrita. We've got some third-party some third-party activity going on at our Bagdad mine in Arizona. So we're trying a bunch of alternatives to enhance our understanding and we're gaining confidence that we'll be able to have some. We set this target of 100 million to 200 million pounds over a 12- to 18-month time frame. And we're increasing our ability to -- our confidence in our ability to get to that. And once we get to that, that will open up some iterations that will allow us to expand it from there. But we've got to get the first success. And we've had some early successes. It's just we've got to get to scale on it. So stay tuned. For second question on Cerro Verde... Richard Adkerson : Well, let me just add. The real focus is what Kathleen and Cory talked about is taking advantage of our existing leach operations. But with success, the future beyond that is really exciting about what we might do in terms of mining sulfide ores and processing them with this technology or looking at historical lead stacks. It is really exciting. Our whole team is really pumped up about it, very good to see. Our project is called leach to the last drop. Kathleen Quirk : And just to circle back on Cerro Verde, we monitor the share price there, the public share price there. The public float is a historical carry forward that has been in place for a very long time, but we do monitor the trading conditions, opportunities if they arise and being able to repurchase. It's a different scenario than in the U.S. where we can have active share purchase programs. But we are in tune with the market there and with certain of the investors. And we'll look at that on an opportunistic basis as we compare uses of cash flow with other priorities at the corporate level. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with VRP. Michael Dudas : So Richard, we've had this dislocation over the last 6, 7 weeks, which has perplexed a lot of folks. And on top of the S&P report, the year-end report that came that you cited that was published a couple of weeks ago. Historically, these types of like corrections or uncertainty in the market, will it lead to exponential delays in decision-making and getting some of the supply to the marketplace? Is there going to be just -- or is this like, well, we know longer term conference would be great, so we're going to go through with these discussions. Obviously, you're looking at it in one very measured way. But historically, as the industry, we're going to see further pressure on inventories and deficits because this type of nervous is could lead to further delays in the needed investment for the product? Richard Adkerson : Unquestionably, I mean you just think about the impact on corporate strategy, the amount of financing that's available for smaller projects. All -- this is just another element of the series of barriers to supply development that the industry had already faced. And unquestionably, I mean it was pointed out earlier in the discussion that for a company like ours is we got this really great project in Chile that's being delayed by the politic -- political situation there and the uncertainties about taxation. When you balance that out with a company like ours and potentially being able to buy your stock back so cheaply, that's going to happen. That's going to have an impact. The investment in this industry is just so long term, so long term, even for a project as straightforward as doubling our concentrator at Bagdad. That's a multiyear effort to go through the permitting, the planning process, the procurement process. So it's the long-term nature of this business and a head spinning move in prices like this is going to have an impact on those investment decisions. I don't know of any company that's just going to close their eyes and say that the market is so good in the future, we're just going to ignore this. You can't ignore it. I mean it's been such a dramatic decline, and there's still such uncertainties as to what's going to happen, that all of that is going to delay production investments and there was such a limited number of investments available out there anyway, it's just building towards this coming huge deficit in the copper markets. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Timna Tanners : I guess I'm just trying to kind of square that what we've been discussing in terms of Freeport Slide 12 in terms of all those projects. What does it take that you need to see to -- from the Chilean politics to get more confident in El Abra? And what does it take in terms of copper prices just generally to proceed? Or are many of these still very attractive at recent prices? Richard Adkerson : So Timna, thanks for the question. It's -- in looking at our situation, there's a lot of balancing of competing economics for these projects that come into play. The uncertainty at El Abra where we have a 50%, 51% interest, and we operate with Codelco as our partner, just means that, that is a burden on that project, whereas investments in the U.S., where Kathleen mentioned we own substantially all of our landing fees. So there's no royalties where we have a favorable income tax situation that's partially due to the tax legislation that's in place now and partially due to net operating loss carryforward we have from the oil and gas investment. And all the issues around community support and what you have to provide in international operations affects that balance that we have. And Kucing Liar is different because it's just a clear-cut fit into our long-term plan for managing the available ore. Grasberg -- and by the way, I might mention, Emily, you had your report today a question about extending the 4041 deadline there. We're in early discussions. I think we have a pathway forward, but we have a proceed with that. And that is something that would benefit all stakeholders and also open that whole area for further exploration, which has been limited because of the 2041 deadline under our existing operating rights. So it's not an easy question to say, but it's a balancing off on all these things. And right now, the leach focus is not -- it's going to be affected by economics, timing of bag, that maybe the Lone Star project, the near-term expansions are going well and they have some more opportunities there. The sulfide is longer term and then El Abra is the 1 that's really challenged. Beyond that, we have further opportunities in the U.S. at Morenci and at our other mines. But -- what I really like about our company is we have this huge pipeline of projects. The nearest term will take time rather than leaching which will come quicker. But Beyond that, we have such great resources that are available to us beyond reserves. And over time, those will come into reserves. And so this company is sustainable for a very long period of time, without having to do anything else, without having to do anything else. But the decisions about timing and when to come and so forth, has a lot of moving parts, and that got -- it's just gotten more complicated by seeing this 30% drop in copper prices and not knowing what's going to happen in the next 2 to 3 years globally. So it had an impact on us, and it will have an impact on other companies. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Abhi Agarwal with Deutsche Bank. Abhinandan Agarwal : Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. I just had a question on inflation. So in terms of inflation, where do you see the biggest upside risk into the year-end and 2023? And you did talk about using spot gasoline prices and including labor in your forecast. But does the Q3 and the 2022 guide reflect the spot consumable prices you are seeing? That's my first question. Kathleen Quirk : The first answer is yes to that. We're using spot prices for our energy inputs. Richard Adkerson : Yes. And that's just our philosophy and planning overall. We don't like -- we develop an outlook and a plan based on current prices, and then we look at a number of different scenarios for what might happen if that varies. But we don't go into any kind of economic analysis. Our sales are coming up with predictions on the future. Have heard long ago that's a dead man's game. And so we just use current prices and then look at scenarios of -- I'll say this, for those of you who followed the company a long time, you've heard me say about the correlation between our input costs and copper prices that's been there. And that's 1 of the rationales we've always used for not hedging. This current market has disrupted some of those longstanding traditional relationships. Energy is the most significant one, and that's changing. And every day, you see that changing. So we're just having to -- we have to approach this with prudence, with an overall goal of protecting this great set of assets we have and protecting the future that I think is going to be so great for our company. So we're going into that mode that we've followed before of really aggressively managing our business as the world around us changes. Kathleen Quirk : And to your question about where we see the most risk or opportunity either way, I'd say energy is the 1 that's the most uncertain. As Richard talked about the correlation, what we're spending on energy, if we did historical correlations going back over a long period of time, our energy costs correlated to a $3.25 copper price, would be 40% lower or greater. And so -- but yet people are talking about potentially energy prices spiking again because of what's going on in the world. But if we really do get this recession really comes through, maybe it's a scenario where historical correlations start to fold in more than they are today. But our current plans are not based on historical correlations. They're based on the current market conditions. Richard Adkerson : With you, and this is obviously -- the biggest risk to our business right now is, is the future demand going to drop off a cliff because of a global recession. And that's what the market -- the market is pricing that in, in large part right now because that's what the expectation was. I mean, look at that Bank of America survey that they did, 80% of the people were projecting bad times. But we haven't had that yet. But that's the risk to our business. If the dire expectations about recession occur, demand will fall off. We can adjust to it. We're not going to put our company at risk. And that's why we're going to be very prudent about the way we manage capital, manage operations and manage our financial policy. I'm such a big believer in copper. I have this urge to be a lot more entrepreneur about it. But history has taught me we need to be really prudent to protect ourselves in case things happen that put us at risk, and we're not going to do that. I'm just not going to do it. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC. John Tumazos : We\u2019re in a such a strong position at Freeport and given the 2 big capital projects, the smelter and Kucing Liar basically nondiscretionary, but we really don't need to make too many changes lay off geologist paying CapEx around a lot and that there's less risk of a double mistake of making all these cuts and then the market recovering, panics, start and stop so fast, it's so hard for you to manage. Do you think it's very likely we're steady state at Freeport? Richard Adkerson : Well, let's see, you mentioned people. We made substantial cuts in personnel just over 2 years ago with the COVID issue. We did that. We always treat people fairly. It was mostly between incentivized retirements or incentivized terminations and so forth, and we were very attractive with doing that. By the way, we have carried over some really efficient benefits in our G&A cost. And what we learned during that period of time about not needing to travel as much and working efficiently with our people. I encourage all of you to go back and look at the history of Freeport's G&A and just see what progress we made with it. John, we're actively looking for technical people. I mean we're not talking about cutting back technical people at all because this opportunity with leaching with data analytics, which is used in leaching, but in the rest of our business. And my experience has shown you find good technical people, you can -- they'll create value for you. So steady state, maybe that's one way of saying it now that with Grasberg being where it is with its ramp-up, we're still working on a mill enhancement there, power issues. We're dealing with our power plant there. And we have some other investments made, but we're at our run rate. And clearly, the expansions are being affected by today's copper price. So yes, we're just focused on staying in a strong financial position, keeping all of our options open and being prepared to act when time makes sense. Kathleen Quirk : We raised the capital we need for the smelter. That's an important part of our agreement with the Indonesian government. And we raised the capital we need, both in the bond and the bank markets earlier this year before things got deteriorated. And so we're in good shape. That's an execution project. The Kucing -- it's complicated execution project, but it's an execution project. The Kucing Liar project is investments over a long period of time. We can have some pluses and minuses as we look out in the plan to tweak it, but it's a long-term investment. The places where we do have opportunities to look at is, in the short term, some of the funding that we were planning in the Americas for various projects to build capacity, to build capacity assurance to sustain higher mining rates so that we could keep our production levels high. Those kinds of things as we've done in the past, we can look at if we need -- we will look at if we need to essentially cut spending. And the reductions in mining rates help current cash flow. It makes it harder in the future to get the flywheel going again as we're just now doing with the cutbacks we did in 2020. But as Richard said, it's something that our team has experience with. We do it in a disciplined way. I think the important thing for the market to understand is that as we do these kinds of things, they don't -- the switch doesn't get turned on quickly. So they have lasting effects. Not -- you don't lose value. It's not lost, but it's deferred for potentially an extended period of time. So we take all that into account when we make these decisions on modifying operating plans. Richard Adkerson : And the timing of that PT-FI $3 billion financing was very fortuitous. Now I was just looking at this this morning and what we issued it with and what today's interest rates are for those bonds that are trading. It was great that Kathleen and our team have done when they got it done. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Jatinder Goel with Exane BNP Paribas. Jatinder Goel : Just a question on inflation, but from a different perspective. A number of other companies in the sector are highlighting CapEx inflation being higher than OpEx inflation. Interestingly, encouragingly, your CapEx guidance is almost unchanged for this year and next year, barring some $100 million shift. What's driving that? Are you seeing any CapEx inflation? Or is there any deferral of activity keeping that absolute $3.1 billion average CapEx slide unchanged, but it's at the cost of some lower activity level? Kathleen Quirk : Yes. I think it's a function of where we are in these projects. In Indonesia, a large portion of our capital budget was related to the underground the underground development. And so we were well advanced in this project. The last part of it really is this increase in our SAG milling circuit, which is coming on in Q3. So -- but if we're starting projects today or in the last 6 months, I think that's a fair assumption. And that also goes into the calculus of is this the environment that you want to undertake major new projects in because not only do you have the costs up, but the availability of labor, to someone's question earlier, is that the risks are higher. And so the current copper price doesn't appropriately reflect what is required to get new projects developed. And that's the thing Richard was talking about earlier, where we've got a big disconnect. But our capital projects that we're doing today have been in progress for a long time. So -- and we've got a core amount of sustaining projects, and we do have some higher equipment and parts and those kinds of things. Some of the parts have affected OpEx. But we're not -- given where we are in our capital cycle, we don't have the inflation that someone brand new starting a new project would have today. Richard Adkerson : Yes. It's the nature of what we're spending money on. And like Kathleen said, where we are in the cycle. And supply chain issues are still real too, and that would be a very daunting thing to think about as you were undertaking a $6 billion, $7 billion new project in this industry. Just coming back -- it just keep coming back that the supply chain -- I mean, the supply barriers to develop copper to meet this demand are really significant. You just -- you think about we've had high copper prices now for 20 years. And just look at what the industry has tried to spend and develop and what's been developed. And now you've got these new things that are coming in, you can't wipe away community environmental concerns just because the world needs copper. You have all the social issues that are competing for the populations in Latin America and problems -- we in the U.S. benefit because we have greenfield expansions, but you see the problems of trying to build -- I mean, brownfield expansions. You see the problems in trying to build a greenfield expansions here in the U.S., they're just daunting. I've just never seen anything like it and it's just so clear to me after looking at our commodities businesses and actual resource business is now for all these decades about where the copper business is and what the future lies ahead for us. And just why I'm so excited about what our companies will benefit from the assets, people experience, how we do things. So it's going to be a great future. Jatinder Goel : Excellent. Just a quick follow-up. On the smelting CapEx, the only change has been in the precious metals, refinery side. Is all of the remaining CapEx on existing smelter expansion plus the new greenfield smelter all locked in, and there is no risk of escalation there, just to be sure? Kathleen Quirk : No, it's not. Richard Adkerson : No. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. We agreed with the EPC contractor to a target price, and we both share some risk in that. And we've got some contingencies, a good portion also when you think about the labor cost, local labor costs and where the dollar is. So that will help us if things stay with the way they are. But it's not a fixed price contract. It's got some risk sharing between the parties. Operator : I'll now turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. Richard Adkerson : Let me just say, you all know how I feel on what's the basis for our company's strategy. So what -- if any of you -- and I'm asking this question broadly within the industry with all my contacts, but any of you on this call and follow our company so closely. If you have a different view about the fundamental outlook for the business, just call me directly. I'd be very interested in hearing it. One thing the reality is that I certainly recognize is that even with institutional investors, their views of the -- of their investments are much more short run than what Freeport's view is of how we have to invest for the future of this copper business. But I'm really interested in hearing contrary views, if any of you would like to share them with me. And with that, we thank you all, it\u2019s exciting and we look forward to reporting in the next quarter and seeing how this world unfolds. It's going to be very interesting. Thank you all. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan conference call, and happy 2023 to everyone. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter 2022 operating and financial results, and a copy of our press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today\u2019s call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. On the call today with me are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Maree Robertson, our CFO; Mark Johnson, our Chief Operating Officer of Indonesia; Josh Olmsted, who is our Chief Operating Officer for the Americas; Mike Kendrick, who leads our molybdenum business; Cory Stevens, who heads our Engineering and Construction and overall Global Technical Services Group; Rick Coleman, who is actively involved in all of our construction projects; as well as Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. So, we have a full complement of management team here today. And we\u2019ll start -- Richard will make some opening remarks, and then he\u2019ll turn it back to me and we\u2019ll cover the slide materials, and then we\u2019ll open up the call for your questions. Turn it to you, Richard. Richard Adkerson : Yes. Thanks, Kathleen. Thank you all for joining us today. As Kathleen said, after my overview remarks, which will be brief, she will review our results for the quarter. It was a strong fourth quarter. The numbers speak for themselves. It reflects the performance of our global team, and I much appreciate everybody\u2019s hard work. I read one of you said this morning in a report, mining is a tough business, and it certainly is. Nobody knows that, I think, better than me. But what we\u2019ve done and is reflected in our results for 2022 and particularly the fourth quarter, is remarkable. Most of you, who know our business and maybe all of you do, recognize the need to look at Freeport into two major segments. Our operations in Indonesia by PT Freeport Indonesia is characterized by very large volumes, very low cost because of the grades and the gold content, largest gold mine in the world is a byproduct. As you\u2019ll see in the fourth quarter, it operated as the world\u2019s second largest copper mine with a net unit cost of $0.06 a pound. Our business in Americas is quite different. We have among the largest mines in the world, the mines have low grades, there\u2019s much more material to be processed, to be mined and processed to recover the copper, and it\u2019s an operation that gets challenged by low copper prices and factors like inflation. But when you look at the results and what our team has done this year, it\u2019s been very positive. It\u2019s also characterized by having some large future brownfield expansion opportunities, which is particularly meaningful given the situation of the copper in the world. Indonesia, it was just rock-solid performance. We\u2019ve been operating underground there for 40-plus years now. We\u2019ve been investing in the current underground operations that we have been ramping up over the past three years to become the largest underground mining operations in the world for the past 25 years. It just reflects the long-term nature of our business. The last three years have really been notable. We completed mining the Grasberg open pit, which had been the bulk of our operations since the discovery of the ore body in the late 1980s. We completed mining that pit at the end of 2019. Then early in 2020, we faced COVID. And for years, this transition was viewed as a risk overlying Freeport\u2019s business. And it\u2019s just a major accomplishment that we\u2019ve reached our targeted mining and metal production targets that is what\u2019s arguably the most complicated mine in the world. And it\u2019s all results of the hard work and accomplishments of our team there, very proud of them. The Americas business has done very well in meeting the challenges that we\u2019ve had there, dealing with inflation, dealing with a period of low copper prices, we have issues that are challenged in terms of getting workers for our operations in the Americas. Our operation in Peru was facing a severe challenge with COVID that they manage very well. The political situation in Peru right now is very complicated. There are protests throughout the country. Our team is doing very well. We are continuing to manage housing, feeding our people and continuing our operations. We are slowing down a bit to make sure we have supplies for the long run, but we have support by our workforce and fundamental support for our business by the local community there because we\u2019ve established such a great relationship with them. So we are -- as we look out now trying to predict short-term copper prices is very difficult. We actually don\u2019t even try to do it ourselves. We deal with short-term negative movements when they occur by having a strong balance sheet and a conservative financial policy. It\u2019s actually good to see right now that market sentiment going into 2024 is much improved over the end of -- going into the fourth quarter. But we are on the outlook for the well-known risks that the world faces today, and we\u2019re prepared to deal with it. We are a long-term business. And we -- everything we do is focused, not on the short run other than to protect ourselves by having a strong balance sheet, managing our business in the right way, but our success is going to be measured over the long run. And copper\u2019s long-run outlook is increasingly positive based on fundamentals of demand and supply. We committed to copper 20 years ago when we were a single asset company, the rationale for acquiring Phelps Dodge more than 15 years ago is being reinforced today by the combination of this really special mine we have in Indonesia and the global operations and growing operations that we have in the Americas. It was the right decision 20 years ago to focus on copper and is the right decision now. Kathleen? Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, Richard. We\u2019ll start on Slide 3, which summarizes our performance for the full year 2022. And just a couple of notes on the fourth quarter from our press release. We finished the year with a strong fourth quarter. Copper and gold sales exceeded our October guidance. And our consolidated unit net cash costs of $1.53 per pound in the quarter were better than our estimates going into the quarter. With average copper realizations in the fourth quarter of $3.77 per pound, we generated strong margins with fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA at approximately $2.25 billion. Looking at the year, we are proud of the performance of our team stayed focused on effective execution and on driving results in a volatile macroeconomic environment. After successfully growing our volumes in 2021 by 19% for copper and 59% for gold compared with 2020, we achieved another year of growth in 2022, with 11% higher copper sales volumes and a 34% increase in gold volumes. Our team in Indonesia has successfully and materially grown production levels in a sustaining large-scale, low-cost production at the world\u2019s largest underground mining complex. In the Americas, our teams in Peru and Chile proved resilient in restoring production during 2022 that had been impacted by the pandemic. And our teams in the U.S. maintain production at 2021 levels despite ongoing labor shortages and we also made significant advances on new technologies to enhance value. For the year, we generated $9.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and that was a year of dramatic swings in commodity prices and cost drivers. Our operating cash flows for the year, which were net of $1.5 billion in working capital requirements was in excess of our capital investments in our operations, and we nearly tripled our cash return to shareholders, pursuant to our performance-based payout policy. We ended the year with net debt, excluding the debt associated with our smelter of $1.3 billion, and that\u2019s substantially below the level of mid-2021 when we initiated our performance-based payout policy. On Slide 4, you\u2019ll see we\u2019ve listed notable accomplishments during the year. In addition to driving value in our operating and financial areas of achievement, we\u2019re very proud of our work with third parties to validate all of our operations under the Copper Mark standards, the measurable progress we\u2019re making on our climate initiatives and the expanded disclosures we\u2019ve developed to enhance transparency and accountability. We\u2019ll talk about markets next, and we\u2019ve got a slide on Page 5. We experienced significant volatility as many of you have seen during 2022, with copper prices trading from a high of $4.87 per pound earlier in the year, falling to $3.18 per pound midyear and partially recovering to $3.80 per pound by year-end. Prices continued to move higher in early 2023 to a level currently approximating $4.25 per pound as several of the macroeconomic clouds began to lift. We discussed on prior calls that the dramatic moves in 2022 have been largely -- been based on sentiment rather than fundamentals. The facts are that the physical markets for copper have remained tight even during a period of weaker economic data coming out of China, and that\u2019s evidenced by the low levels of available copper inventories throughout the year. At the same time, copper\u2019s importance in the economy continues to grow as a result of the intensity of use in clean energy applications and the global acceleration of electrification. We believe we\u2019re still in the early innings of a broad-based secular driver of long-term demand. The ability of the industry to meet this multiyear period of growing demand continues to be challenged, leading to large market deficits in the future. You read about these challenges every day, and it\u2019s getting harder, not easier, higher long-term prices are needed to incentivize new supplies. We\u2019ve lived through the ups and downs in the copper market. We\u2019ve effectively managed our operations and balance sheet during periods of volatility, and we\u2019re prepared for this, but we believe the long-term fundamentals point to a real step change in how copper is valued in the economy. Turning to our reserve position on Slide 6. We benefit from a geographically diverse high-quality portfolio of copper mines with significant exposure to gold and molybdenum. Our strategy, as Richard discussed, is centered around being foremost in copper. And we benefit from a portfolio of assets with characteristics that are very difficult to replicate. We show our reserve position at the end of 2022 with over 100 billion pounds of proved and probable reserves. We have an average reserve life of over 25 years. We added twice the amount of reserves we produced in 2022, principally at our U.S. mines in the Morenci and Safford Lone Star districts where we\u2019re focused on future growth. In addition to proved and probable reserves, we have enormous mineral resources of 235 billion pounds of copper. Over half of this is located in the U.S. where we have established operations, a great track record and a valuable franchise. We\u2019ll continue to work as we go forward to convert these resources into viable mine plans and future production. It\u2019s an extraordinarily valuable resource position in a world that\u2019s going to need more copper in the future. We wanted to focus a little bit on molybdenum on this call. And on Slide 7, we\u2019ve got some information about our molybdenum business. We\u2019re a leader in that industry. We\u2019re the world\u2019s largest producer by a significant margin. And with the price move over the last couple of months of over 50% in molybdenum, we thought you\u2019d be interested in learning more about our business. We produced 85 million pounds of molybdenum in 2022, and that\u2019s comprised about 60% from copper mines as a byproduct and the balance from two primary molybdenum mines that we operate in Colorado. And these are the only primary molybdenum mines that are currently operated in the United States. We also operate downstream processing facilities to produce products that are used in a broad range of metallurgical specialty steel and chemical applications. The price moved from $18 per pound at the start of the fourth quarter to over $30 per pound currently has been driven by some of the same supply issues that have impacted copper. And in addition, demand drivers continue to be supported from the oil and gas, aerospace and power generation sectors. So, we note on this slide, the impact of a $5 change in molybdenum prices, it\u2019s material at $400 million in annual EBITDA and $375 million in cash flow. And the recent move of over $10 per pound, if sustained at a higher price, adds additional leverage to our results. Looking at our operating stats for 2022 on Slide 8, you\u2019ll see our sales for the year were about 35% from the U.S., 28% from South America and 37% from Indonesia. In the U.S., our sales were similar to 2021 levels, and we grew sales volumes by 10% in South America and by 20% in Indonesia. In the U.S., we\u2019re continuing our focus on productivity, given the current limitations on adding to our workforce, we\u2019re taking advantage of technology advancements and opportunities to expand production from leaching at low incremental cost, and we\u2019re planning our next phase of growth, as we\u2019ll talk about in a few minutes. As discussed, the biggest resource position and source of long-term growth we have is a real opportunity in the United States. In South America, both Cerro Verde and El Abra grew production in 2022 in a complex social and political environment. After successfully recovering from the pandemic-related interruptions in 2022, our team in Peru is now dealing with challenges associated with civil unrest that you\u2019ve all read about. We\u2019re prioritizing the safety and security of our workforce. We\u2019re navigating disruptions to transportation routes and supply chains. To date, the impacts have not been significant but the situation is dynamic day by day, and we\u2019re watching it very carefully. The bottom of the chart shows the 2022 cost performance. As we\u2019ve talked about on prior calls, we experienced significant inflation pressures across the business during 2022, particularly for energy and other commodity-related consumables, and in the second half of the year, started to see inflation from a rising cost of materials, supplies and services. The situation started to improve in 2022 with a number of the commodity-related consumables, but we\u2019re still dealing with costs in excess of historical levels. If you look at the average cost for the year at Grasberg of $0.09 per pound is remarkable, particularly in the context of this cost environment. Richard talked about the significant success story of the Grasberg transition, and we\u2019ve got some details on Slide 9, significant success for not only Freeport but also something for the global mining industry to be proud of in the country of Indonesia. We started planning for this transition over 25 years ago, and the team has just done an outstanding job. We benefit from the fact that several from the team who were involved in the planning of this project, including Mark Johnson, who\u2019s on this call, stayed with it over this period. And over the years, we\u2019ve added great talent to our team with experts from around the world. The success of this project, the mutual respect built over the years between Freeport, the government of Indonesia and local communities has established a really strong foundation for the future. We\u2019ve got the opportunity with this resource to plan a new phase of development longer term and are continuing to discuss with the government the opportunity to extend our long-term partnership beyond 2041. If you go to Slide 10, we\u2019ve got an update on our smelter project. And this is our key feature of our commitment to the Indonesian government, was to expand domestic copper smelting and refining capacity in Indonesia. We\u2019re making really good progress on constructing the new smelter in Eastern Java, it\u2019s near our existing smelter, PT smelting at Gresik. You can see from the pictures that construction is advancing. We\u2019ve got thousands of workers now on site. We\u2019re working very closely with our EPC contractor to try as much as possible to make up delays that were caused by the pandemic. We reached a milestone of over 50% completion recently and we are expecting to begin commissioning the smelter during 2024. As you recall, the capital investments for this project are being funded from a successful bond offering that PT-FI completed during 2022. And so, we have the funding between the bond offering and a revolver at PT-FI to fund this project. Moving to our growth outlook. This is exciting opportunities for the company, and we continue to plan our next phase of growth. We\u2019ve got benefit from having multiple organic projects to develop within the portfolio over time. We operate all the mines we have interest in. We\u2019re able to share experiences, new technologies, operating synergies and best practices across the portfolio as we develop projects, and we can direct capital across the portfolio to the highest value opportunities. Our proven technical capacity capabilities and management is a notable strength. And importantly, we\u2019ve earned a track record and a reputation for operating sustainably and responsibly. The world, we believe, is going to need all of our projects and more. The project with the shortest lead time is our Americas leach initiative. We\u2019ve talked a lot about it in recent calls. The economics are compelling, low capital intensity, low incremental operating costs and a low carbon footprint. The new data analytics capabilities, we are continuing, to be applied to prioritize our work streams on the highest value. We\u2019re continuing our work to apply covers to the leach stockpiles because of the benefits that you get from heat retention in enhancing recoveries, and we\u2019ve identified new areas that were not pursued historically. We\u2019re also continuing to test various additives that can further enhance recoveries. This is a really significant opportunity for us. We\u2019re continuing to target a run rate of 200 million pounds per annum by the end of this year and success of this level -- at this level would provide opportunities to scale larger. We\u2019re in a great position to lead this innovation with our long history in leaching and large inventory to work with. At our Bagdad mine in Northwest Arizona, we\u2019re progressing a feasibility study to double production at that site. We expect to complete the feasibility this year, and we\u2019ll be in a position to assess options on how we time the future development. We started advanced planning to commence construction of a new tailings site that would support the existing operation, but would also provide flexibility for the expanded production. And as a brownfield expansion, this project could be developed more quickly than a greenfield development. Our Lone Star opportunity is really something special. We\u2019ve been successful in increasing production levels substantially above the original project. And we\u2019re really in the early stages in the development of this mine, as we mine the oxide ores more quickly, we\u2019re opening up the opportunity for a major sulfide development long term. The resource is massive. You\u2019ve seen the numbers, 50 billion pounds of potential resource here. We\u2019re doing a lot of drilling. And importantly, it\u2019s located in an established mining district in the U.S. In Chile, we\u2019ve defined the opportunity for a major expansion at our El Abra mine. As we continue to monitor regulatory and fiscal matters in Chile, we\u2019re planning a project to invest in infrastructure, water infrastructure to provide flexibility to extend existing operations and optionality to support a new concentrator. We\u2019re also planning at El Abra to test new leaching technologies in the near term, to evaluate the potential for expanded leach production and possibly competing technologies to a concentrator. We\u2019re continuing our development of the Kucing Liar deposit in Indonesia. We\u2019re really gaining a lot of efficiencies from the work we did at Grasberg Block Cave. And similar to that development, this is a long-term project. We expect to have initial production from Kucing Liar deposit towards the end of this decade. Moving to Slide 12. We provide a three-year outlook for our sales volumes. And as we talked about, we achieved two years of growth in copper sales. And currently, our forecast reflects sales in the \u201823 to \u201825 period that are similar to 2022 levels. Our mine production is actually going to be higher than our sales by about 100 million pounds in 2023 and 2024. And that is a result of our domestic processing arrangements in Indonesia where the point of sale has changed from selling concentrate to selling cathodes. And so, a portion of our production will be inventoried until it\u2019s processed and sold through our smelters. Previously, this inventory would have been held by third-party smelters. We\u2019ve got small revisions otherwise to 2023 guidance that reflects assumption of a continuation of tight labor markets in the U.S. That\u2019s impacted our ability to increase mining rates. And success also in our leach recovery initiative could provide some upside in the U.S. as we look over the next three-year period. In the reference materials on Slide 30, we provide information on our 2023 sales by quarter. The reason for the drop in the first quarter reflects the impact of the tolling arrangement in Indonesia. But, you can see the balance of the year is fairly stable at over 1 billion pounds of copper sales per quarter. Moving to the cost outlook for 2023, we\u2019re providing guidance of average cost of $1.60 per pound for the year. That compares with $1.50 per pound in 2022. We show a comparison to the two years, and you\u2019ll see the site production cost line item is about 4.5% higher than the 2022 average. And that\u2019s a result of assumptions that we\u2019ve made in our forecast for higher average electricity and coal costs compared with the 2022 average and also higher power requirements, principally in Indonesia, and the impact of higher cost of equipment components, supply costs and labor cost increases. The other line items are offsetting. You\u2019ll note a decline in royalties and duties. That really is reflective of a recent reduction in our export duty in Indonesia as a result of the smelter progress. I\u2019ll also note that this assumes a molybdenum price of $20 per pound in 2023. The current price is $30 a pound and each $2 per pound change in molybdenum is $0.02 a pound. So, if current prices hold, would have roughly $0.10 a pound less cash -- unit net cash costs and this reflects. In recent months, inflationary pressures have been less severe than we experienced during 2022. We\u2019re encouraged by that. And we\u2019re going to continue to focus on managing costs that we can control. We\u2019re continuing to pursue technology-driven enhancements to mitigate the impacts, particularly in the U.S. Getting to our cash flows, significant leverage to copper prices. We\u2019ve got on Slide 14, we show modeled results for EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $3.50 per pound to $5 per pound copper. These are modeled results and we use the average of 24 and 25 with current volume and cost estimates and holding gold flat at $1,900 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $20 per pound. And you\u2019ll see here that annual EBITDA would range from nearly $9 billion per annum at $3.50 copper, to $15 billion per annum at $5 copper. And our operating cash flows would range over these prices from $6 billion at $350 copper to $11 billion at $5 copper. And we show sensitivities to various commodities on the right and input costs. With our long-life reserves and large-scale production, we\u2019re well positioned from future -- to benefit from future metals intensive growth trends with prospects for increasing cash returns under our performance-based payout framework. Our capital expenditure plans are summarized on Slide 15. The capital expenditures totaled $2.7 billion, excluding the smelter in 2022. We\u2019ll note that this was lower than the $3.3 billion estimate we provided going into 2022, and that reflects lead times and our focus during the year to prioritize critical projects. The current forecast for 2023 totals $3.4 billion, and that\u2019s a slight change from our previous estimate of $3.3 billion for 2023. And capital expenditures for 2024 are currently forecast to approximate $3 billion as spending on the Grasberg projects reach completion. We always are very careful in managing our capital cost to maintain flexibility in response to market condition, while ensuring that our investments are sufficient to support a reliable long-term production profile. Returning to the financial policy that we began to implement in the second half of 2021, it\u2019s really centered on three priorities. The cornerstone of the financial policy is maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity. And that provides significant flexibility for the future. We\u2019ve been executing on this performance-based payout. It provides for 50% of our free cash flow to be allocated to shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share purchases and the balance available to invest in our projects. Since commencing the performance-based payout policy in the second half of 2021, we\u2019ve returned about 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share purchases. And at the same time, we also further strengthened our balance sheet, providing capacity for funding new projects over time. We did not purchase shares in the second half of 2022 because of the significant change in market conditions and the resulting impact on cash flows in the second half of the year. The improved market conditions will drive increased free cash flow, which will boost shareholder returns, and our future discretionary share purchases will be dependent on our cash flow and overall market conditions. We believe the three priorities of balance sheet strength, allocating cash flows to a mix of shareholder returns, and organic growth will enhance long-term value of our business. In closing, I just want to reiterate our view about the positioning for the Company, a bright long-term future supported by our attractive portfolio of assets, supported by the fundamentals of the copper business and the positive outlook for the markets we serve. Our team is energized. We\u2019re motivated to continue building long-term value in our business and on executing our plans responsibly, safely and efficiently. And I want to thank you for your attention, and operator, we\u2019ll now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Emily Chieng : Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. And thank you for taking my questions. I would like to sort of ask around Freeport\u2019s growth appetite. And as you think about the copper price environment and how the market is trending, has anything in your mind changed around how you view Freeport\u2019s need to pursue or accelerate growth plans? There\u2019s clearly been a lot that has changed in the broader macro environment as well. And I wouldn\u2019t mind hearing about how maybe some of the leaching opportunity can play into that and what the potential annual run rate basis could look like when fully developed? Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Thanks, Emily. With leaching, we\u2019re not constraining ourselves to conserve capital or anything else. We\u2019re -- we believe this is such a great opportunity for us that we are pursuing it as aggressively as we can, and we are pursuing it on a number of different fronts, some using outside vendors, some doing things on our own, some in joint ventures with companies. It\u2019s just such a great opportunity to add production at low capital cost and with low carbon. So, it\u2019s not something we\u2019re constraining. The other projects that we have, and Kathleen reviewed them, we have a series of major capital projects that are multiyear large capital requirements. And for those, we are working hard to prepare ourselves for them and doing work so that we can go forward. But we are going to wait until the uncertainties that we\u2019ve been facing recently are -- become clearer. As I said, the current sentiment is much stronger than it was three months ago, but there\u2019s still a lot of overhang in the market, as you can see in the market today. So, we are waiting to see that our project in Chile is dependent on the direction the country goes in with this current consideration of its laws and its constitution. So, that is really going to be on hold until that becomes clear. So, we\u2019re not preparing any major change in the first part of 2023 versus what we did in 2022. Kathleen Quirk : Emily, on the leaching run rate, the 200 million pound target that we\u2019ve laid out, those -- we believe that that can be attained just from these operational changes that we\u2019re making. The heat retention, leaching in places that we weren\u2019t leaching previously, directing the solutions to places where we can enhance recoveries really from data analytics that we\u2019re getting that are helping us -- helping guide our operations every day. Those things we think we can get just operationally. The -- on top of that, this research and development that\u2019s going on with respect to additives, that could scale it larger. So, this 200 million pounds that we\u2019re talking about, we think that is really just bringing more of a light on our leach stockpiles and moving aggressively to -- over the last several years, the focus on the industry has been more on concentrating. And now we\u2019re putting focus back on these leach initiatives, and we\u2019ve identified some things. I wouldn\u2019t say low-hanging fruit, but it\u2019s achievable things that we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019re already starting to see results. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Orest Wowkodaw : Just given the uncertainty out there with respect to both Chinese and ex China markets, can you give us an updated outlook on what you\u2019re seeing from your customers? Like are you seeing any indications of slowing demand? Kathleen Quirk : Richard, do you want me to take that? Orest, we\u2019re not -- I mean, there\u2019s pockets -- of course, in the residential markets there\u2019s pockets of weakness, but there are -- we\u2019re just continuing to see strong physical demand, we\u2019re selling everything that we can produce. And there\u2019s no ability for us to, at this point, produce more that customers are looking for. So, on balance, I\u2019d say the physical market continues to be healthy, and we have -- most of our insights come from within the U.S. because we\u2019re a very significant part of the U.S. marketplace. And -- so generally, the market is continuing to be strong, and we\u2019re selling everything that we can produce. And if we could produce more, our customers would want it. Richard Adkerson : Even looking back to 2022, you\u2019ll recall, I mentioned I think on more than one conference call that there was a disconnect between even then the physical world we were dealing with, with our customers and what the market was doing. So, it has been striking as to the strength of demand that we\u2019ve had, we had no problem selling our production. We\u2019ve actually -- there was a shortage of wire rod in the United States that was -- where we couldn\u2019t meet everything that was being produced. And then, with our copper concentrate customers, including China, people were buying all that we produced and actually wanting more. So, market sentiment is better now. And but our customers continue to be very positive. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Chris LaFemina : You have $1.3 billion of net debt as of the end of 2022. Your net debt target range is $3 billion to $4 billion. So, I guess, the first question is, is that the range that we should think about, or are you comfortable maintaining net debt below that range? In other words, if you really want to get to $3 billion to $4 billion, how do you get that from here, generating positive cash flow? You can step up the buybacks, maybe accelerate returns. But do we get to a $3 billion to $4 billion range this year, or is that not going to happen? Richard Adkerson : Well... Kathleen Quirk : The $1.3 billion -- go ahead. Richard Adkerson : No, I was just going to say, Chris, and Kathleen can talk about the details. When we announced the financial policy, as I looked out and I said, the likelihood is, cash is going to come in faster than we can spend it just because of the nature of our capital projects are long term. It takes a lot of time. This has happened before at Freeport. Two previous occasions in our history, we got down to zero net debt. This is setting aside the smelter because that\u2019s financed on its own. But, what this does is by having that cushion between where our debt is and our debt target is, it will allow us to readily be able to finance future construction projects. But it\u2019s just the way the cash flows in versus -- we don\u2019t feel any compulsion to spend money to get the debt up to that target. Chris LaFemina : Okay. So, should we think of it more as a net debt target of below $4 billion rather than $3 billion to $4 billion? Richard Adkerson : Well, I think... Kathleen Quirk : $3 billion to $4 billion is the limit. Yes, $3 billion to $4 billion is what we -- yes. Chris LaFemina : Got it. Okay. Good. And then sorry, second question on Grasberg. You -- it looks like you\u2019ve increased your gold production guidance for 2024, \u201825 and \u201826, but copper volumes are pretty much the same. So, is there something -- what\u2019s happening there to result in an increase and what you expect to get out of that mine in terms of gold over those three years? Richard Adkerson : Well, while the numbers look simple, the mine planning is complicated. And we report the results of our mine planning quarterly. And what you\u2019re seeing there is some revisions in mine planning to optimize resource recovery. It wasn\u2019t any target. It\u2019s just the way that -- the way that the mineralization of these ore bodies fall out as we change future mine plans. And... Kathleen Quirk : Yes, there was some changes between Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ. And additionally, we\u2019ve been getting higher gold recoveries than we had previously forecasted. And that\u2019s helping us as well. So, those are the main differences. Richard Adkerson : And it\u2019s not a targeting it -- it\u2019s not a targeting exercise, Chris. I mean, we didn\u2019t do something to try to get more gold. It was just -- if we look at the orebody, we maximize the value. It\u2019s a dynamic process and report to you the results of that process, and that\u2019s what it is. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Lawson Winder with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Lawson Winder : Good morning, Richard. Good morning, Kathleen. Very nice to hear from you both, and thank you for your time and the update today. I wanted to hopefully ask you two questions. Just one on the C1 cash cost guidance for 2023. To what extent might some of these higher costs year-over-year continue into 2024? Like what is the percentage of those that are more structural as opposed to potentially more cyclical? Kathleen Quirk : I think you can look at -- I think you can look at the makeup of our costs. On that slide, we provide a makeup. And labor cost is something that\u2019s kind of stays with you. Materials and supplies, a component of that is commodity driven and a component of its services driven. The energy, I think, is more variable and things like sulfuric acid is more variable. So, you can look at that pie chart and get a feel for which ones have the ability to change, and we provide some sensitivities on things like currencies and diesel costs. Richard Adkerson : Okay. And one thing that\u2019s -- one thing that\u2019s a real benefit of Freeport that we say a lot. I\u2019m not sure if this is recognized as much as it ought to be. But, we operate every mine that we have an interest in. We have joint venture partners. But unlike other operations where those joint ventures are run as a standalone business, we operate globally through our operatorship rights. And that makes us really important customers of our suppliers. We\u2019re generally one of the very largest customers of people who provide our major supplies. And so, as those suppliers globally have been working to pass along their input cost, our global supply team working with our operations have been affected in mitigating certain of those costs. We\u2019ve had some impact. But again, it\u2019s a real dynamic situation and -- you saw we came in below our quarter-ago estimate. Some costs are moderating, some are carrying over, but it\u2019s just an ongoing thing. And we give you the best outlook we have, and then we work hard to try to operate with as low a cost as we can. Lawson Winder : And then, I wanted to follow up on your comments around El Abra and the plans to advance water infrastructure. Are you considering desalination capacity? Is that what you\u2019re referring to there? And then... Kathleen Quirk : Yes. Richard Adkerson : Yes. That\u2019s really the only alternative. Lawson Winder : Okay. And then what would the time line be on that? Richard Adkerson : Well, we\u2019re working on it right now, and we\u2019re structuring, so that we have the alternative of going forward with our current operations and maximizing those or undertaking a large-scale investment and new concentrator there. So, we\u2019re approaching it to give ourselves the alternatives of going in either of those directions. But we wanted to get started with that because it was going to be required one way or the other. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. And so, we\u2019ve got to go through a permitting process on that as well. So, it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll have any material spending on it until a few years out. Richard Adkerson : It takes time to do it. But as I said, we -- in the past, we\u2019ve been delaying that so -- we made the decision on the concentrator expansion. And in recent months, we\u2019ve decided we need to go ahead with the permitting for the water, desal plant, so that -- because we\u2019re going to need it one way or the other. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead. John Tumazos : Good morning. Congratulations on all the progress in the tough business. Thinking of the Slide 11 with the five projects, I realize it takes a lot of engineering resources for each of these projects. Is five sort of the maximum number or do you have time for a little more? You\u2019re engineering El Abra, but the constitution and taxes and all that stuff is up in the year. So, that\u2019s a big investment in time. You don\u2019t have the Sierrita mill, Chino mill or an additional Morenci mill projects there. I know you can\u2019t do anything -- everything. But a $30-plus moly's Sierrita new mill must be very attractive, you\u2019re budgeting 20 and maybe lower for the long term at 15 for your reserves. Is there too much Indonesia in your CapEx and not enough Americas since you\u2019re the biggest U.S. copper producer? And with politics, the U.S. looks better every day. I know that\u2019s a lot of thoughts, but how you fix the projects? Richard Adkerson : Well, no. And you know it\u2019s a good new story to have this large pipeline of future projects, and I personally believe the world is going to need that copper. Going to your last question first, there is no relationship between Kucing Liar and projects in the U.S. It doesn\u2019t bump out projects. It doesn\u2019t prioritize anything. It\u2019s something that fits right in. It will be financed by PT-FI out of cash flows from PT-FI. And it will support our volumes there through our current operating rights to 2041. We\u2019re talking with the government about extending those. There\u2019s opportunities for Kucing Liar beyond that. And we believe, although we haven\u2019t been engaged in drilling exercises in the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ and who knows what else is down there because we really haven\u2019t fully drilled to explore future opportunities. Now, John, you know the thing about Grasberg, ever since we discovered it, it keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger. But that\u2019s on its own, there is no effect on what we\u2019re doing at Kucing Liar with what we do in the United States. So, we have the financial resources to do -- in the Americas, the United States and South America. So, the ones we\u2019ve listed are the ones we believe are the largest, most significant executable projects initially. The Bagdad expansion is a straightforward doubling of mill capacity, and we\u2019ve dealt with water issues and so forth and... Kathleen Quirk : That will add moly as well, John -- Bagdad. John Tumazos : It has moly, Bagdad. And the biggest problem, quite frankly, at Bagdad is getting workers. It\u2019s just a challenge getting mine workers in today\u2019s world who live in these remote communities where our mines are. But that\u2019s a very executable project, it\u2019s not that complicated. But -- and as we deal with the workers\u2019 situation in housing, as markets clear up, that\u2019s one that would be ready to go. As I said, El Abra is depending on the direction of the government there. Lone Star, which really looks like it can be another base level high-profile operation for Freeport in the future, we\u2019re going to maximize it through the oxide, ore and continue to understand how we attack the big sulfide resource that we\u2019ve identified in. Then beyond that, you mentioned Morenci, Sierrita, and there\u2019s other older mines that we have. Chino has a growth opportunity. All those are in stages of evaluation and understanding what we have. Obviously, when you sit down on top and look at this organization, you want to be focused. You don\u2019t want to just have a scattergun approach. But all of those things provide us growth opportunities from inside our company, which makes it very unlikely that we\u2019ll be acquiring smaller operations to pursue externally. You can just see what\u2019s going in the world when you have to pay a big price, you get a resource and then you put the capital on top of it. And that ends up with a very large investment to try to recover. It\u2019s much better because we get no value today from these future resources that we have within our own portfolio. And with success in developing those, all of the incremental value goes to our shareholders and not somebody else\u2019s shareholders. Kathleen Quirk : John, on your question about -- sorry, Richard. Richard Adkerson : Go ahead. No, go ahead. Kathleen Quirk : I was just going to say your question about the molybdenum situation. We do have excess milling capacity at our Climax mine. And we\u2019ve been operating at below capacity in recent years because of market conditions, but we have started to do a stripping campaign there that will allow us to expand production from Climax. Over time, it doesn\u2019t require a new concentrator or anything like that. So that\u2019s our first one -- and the incremental costs are attractive. So, we are doing that. And as Richard said, we\u2019ve got -- we got a lot of projects in the background. But these are the ones that are strategic and that we\u2019re focused on. The leach technology is a near-term project. And Bagdad long term -- I mean, medium term and the Lone Star major expansion longer term. El Abra, we believe, will get done. It\u2019s a project that it\u2019s attractive and it will get done. It\u2019s a question of when. So, we don\u2019t have a good view yet on when that will go forward. But this investment in some infrastructure and water is going to give us some optionality to support an expansion. So, we\u2019ve got all our people focused on these things and we have an enormous resource base like we were saying in the U.S. where we already have established operations and community support. So, we\u2019re in a really good position as we look forward as to what this world is going to need in terms of new copper supply. None of this can go quickly as you well know. John Tumazos : If I could follow with one more. A few years ago, Freeport bought a drinking water system and a sewage system for Arequipa, the third largest city as you were tripling the El Abra mill and mine -- excuse me, the Cerro Verde mill and mine. And I think you might have some rail -- short-line rails, so that you don\u2019t have as many trucks on the road. Could you just confirm that your tons per day are 350,000 to 400,000 tons a day and no mishaps at Cerro Verde? I think, there\u2019s a lot of confusion in the press about conditions... Kathleen Quirk : Yes. So, in the last several days, we\u2019ve been operating -- we\u2019ve been operating at around that 350,000 level. Prior to that, we were closer to 400,000. We\u2019ve really been operating at 10%, 15% lower just to deal with supplies. And so, we\u2019re watching that every day. And I\u2019ll let Richard comment on the community situation. But in terms of operations, we\u2019re continuing to operate, but we have limited our mill throughput just to deal with the limitations and the concerns about key supplies. Richard Adkerson : Yes. And I\u2019m glad you asked the question because I wanted to elaborate on what I said about Peru in my opening comments. I think all of you know that the Cerro Verde milling complex is the largest in the industry, 400,000-plus per day capacity. The tailings dam will be one of the largest earthen dams ever constructed in the history of mankind, if not the largest. And what John is referring to is a number of years ago, we did as a community project invested in a freshwater system for Arequipa, the second largest city in Peru. And then, as we were developing the expansion of the concentrator and tailings dam, we shifted away from building a new dam on the river that runs just outside of the sea of Arequipa. We come in and we built a wastewater collection and treatment system. And with doing that, we got water for our concentrator and we markedly improved the ecology of the river, and that has been very positively received by downstream farmers and community itself. And that\u2019s really helped foster our positive relationship there. And our team there does overall good. Now, having said that, the situation in Peru is very complicated and nobody at this point can predict how it\u2019s going to unfold. The motions are very high. The government is reluctant to use extreme steps to deal with roadblocks and disruptions and this thing in the day-to-day evolution. And so we are faced with the problems that caused us to cut back on our production rates to conserve line and other inputs so that we could continue to operate. We have the ability to house workers on a temporary basis on site. Most of our workers live in the region of the city of Arequipa, and sometimes those roads have been blocked. So, we\u2019re prepared for it. Our team does a great job in managing things like this over time like COVID and -- but I just wanted to make the point that these concerns that people are raising are directed towards the issues with the government and not directed against us at Cerro Verde and our operations. And so far, we\u2019ve been able to continue to operate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Michael Dudas : I was intrigued by your comment about labor and availability and such. I guess, you\u2019re talking a bit more like in the U.S. But -- how much is that situation limiting -- limited your volume plans for 2023 is probably a small percentage. But is it more secular pressure of getting the qualified productive miners and operators for all your mines? Is that also going to be a limiting factor on how the industry reacts to try to move forward with the market signaling in the future, they\u2019re going to need more supply? Kathleen Quirk : Yes. Well, during COVID, we did have some impacts on our mining rates, and also suspended some milling operations at Morenci. And I\u2019m speaking about the U.S. right now. And we started ramping back up in the U.S. during 2021, and that continued into 2022. And we have a situation where we currently have about something on the order of 1,300 job openings. And we\u2019ve got typically 10,000 to 12,000 employees in the U.S. And so -- and we\u2019ve seen a lot of turnover as well. And it\u2019s just been a very competitive marketplace for labor, as you\u2019ve read about it, in the U.S. And we don\u2019t have that situation in Indonesia or in South America, but we do have competition in the U.S. with other sectors, and that\u2019s continued into 2023 and what\u2019s caused us to change our outlook somewhat. We could have in 2022, produced more, if we were fully staffed. And I believe that is the case again this year. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re making some progress on hires and we are conducting training and some of these workers that we\u2019re hiring now are new to the industry, and so we do have to go through training, and the experience level is not what it was five years ago. So, we\u2019re going through that process. I think it does have some implications to -- the ability to develop a mine in the U.S. is just the labor force. But we\u2019ll see what happens. You\u2019re starting to see some changes in payrolls and that sort of thing, and we\u2019ll see how this unfolds. But it is a factor in our U.S. mining output. Richard Adkerson : Yes. So, it\u2019s broader than mining. I mean, when I talk with people to business council, business around the table, it\u2019s a common theme you hear across many industries. And when all the COVID relief funds went out, that was a factor. I mean, face it, our work is hard work. And it\u2019s harder to drive a big haul truck than it is to drive an Amazon or UPS or FedEx truck. So, we compete with those. We pay our people strong living wages. We\u2019re giving people substantial increases this year. We invest in recreational facilities, try to deal with housing. It\u2019s an issue in Colorado with our molybdenum mines. You can imagine what it\u2019s like there. So, it\u2019s a big issue for us. And as a result, our mine rates aren't meeting what we would like for them to meet, and that affects not only current but future production, and it\u2019s a strategic challenge for us. But, it\u2019s not just us and it\u2019s not just the mining industry, but the mining industry because the nature of the work presents special problems. Kathleen Quirk : This leaching initiative that we\u2019re pursuing is not labor-intensive, because it\u2019s already -- the material has already been mined. So, that\u2019s a real opportunity for us to execute on. Richard Adkerson : And if we -- what it opens up to us is unbelievable. I mean, we have -- Morenci the largest leaching operation in the world. It has been for years. And by enhancing the existing leaching operations using all these tools, data analytics and heat covers and supplements, it\u2019s really amazing. But then it opens up historical leach stacks and potentially places like Lone Star using leaching to replace or minimize concentrator investments. So, it\u2019s really exciting. It\u2019s beyond just this 200 pounds that we\u2019re targeting now. But with success, it\u2019s a great opportunity for us. And it\u2019s not a fracking deal like it was in oil and gas industry. It\u2019s not going to turn the dynamics of the supply situation upside down. But for a company like Freeport with the leaching operations that we have and the application with success to historical leach sites and future mine development, it\u2019s something that\u2019s really exciting. And the great thing about it is to see the excitement of our own guys and own team that\u2019s working on it. It\u2019s really gratifying. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Bendik Folden Nyttingnes with Clarksons Securities. Please go ahead. Bendik Folden Nyttingnes : With the revision in the mining [ore billing] (ph) in Chile at least sort of moving in the right direction, it would be interesting to get some color on what you\u2019d realistically like to see to be comfortable with moving forward with El Abra expansion? Richard Adkerson : Yes. I had the chance for the first time to meet the President of Chile when I was at APAC in Bangkok, and we had a very long conversation in advance of his presentation and it was really positive. And he explained to me what he\u2019s facing, which I can appreciate, Kathleen met with him earlier. And so, like what\u2019s going on in a lot of different countries around the world, particularly when commodity prices go up, people see the opportunity to take financial benefits through royalties and taxes and use them to meet social needs. And it\u2019s just always a balancing situation. At one point, Chile built its whole economy on copper and was very successful. When I was talking with people in Indonesia, the Congo and other places, I would always point to Chile as an example of a country that to be successful by encouraging mining. Chile for a number of reasons, labor and now government situation is losing -- has lost and is losing competitive advantage that it once had. So, these government officials run on a platform of enhancing social programs and then they end up facing the reality of they go too far with that, what that does to their country in terms of its currency, in terms of its economic viability and investment and so forth. President of Chile understands that, and you can see that there has been a more positive tone of dealing with these issues. We\u2019re not a real leader in Chile, although we are in the global copper business. So, we participate with the government, with other companies there and the conversations that are going on and share our experiences that we\u2019ve had in working globally on these kinds of issues. So, the current direction is clearly more positive than it was a year ago. The President is facing a low level of popularity now. And so, it\u2019s a question of facing reality for political leaders. And we certainly lived our -- based our share of those things. And as a mining company, you work hard to gain the trust of the politicians. If you do things the right way, you\u2019re sensitive to their issues. You don\u2019t try to take advantage every time you have a chance to take advantage. We\u2019ve actually walked away from projects, because governments -- we didn\u2019t believe the deal the government was offering us was sustainable long-term deals. And that\u2019s proved out to be the case. So it\u2019s a complicated deal, big part of a business for the leader of a company. And you\u2019ve got to -- as I said, listen, be responsible, and work to find middle ground so that it\u2019s a win-win deal and you\u2019re not taking advantage of anyone and you\u2019re representing your stakeholders. You\u2019re not letting somebody take advantage of you. And that\u2019s what Chile is going through. I believe that the reasonable compromise will be reached because it\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interest for that to happen. Kathleen Quirk : We\u2019ll also be looking at the -- how the constitutional process advances this year. And it appears the financial package is moving forward and they\u2019re reaching some determination, looks as if that\u2019s progressing. But we also want to look at how this constitutional process unfolds as well. And in the meantime, we\u2019re maintaining our options by planning to move forward with the water infrastructure investments. Richard Adkerson : And you know, I can\u2019t let this call go by without telling you how personally pleased I am with our much improved relationship with the government in Indonesia, where we had a multiyear discussions, negotiations over our mining rights in our contract and so forth. It\u2019s just been remarkable what\u2019s happened in the last six months, I made three trips there. We had -- the President had an incredibly positive visit to our job site at the end of August, early September. He asked me to accompany his investment minister and Kathleen was there, too. We did a university road trip and then -- but the two of us went back for the B20 part of G20 and got to see the President and others and it\u2019s just the -- and then APAC and Bangkok. It\u2019s just a great feeling to feel that we\u2019re all altogether now working to -- for the benefit of all the stakeholders and having the success we\u2019re having on the ground at PT-FI. All right\u2026 Operator : With that, I will turn the call over to management for any closing remarks. Richard Adkerson : All right. I was starting that. Thank you everybody for participating today. And you know we\u2019re always available for follow-up calls. You can call David initially and he can make arrangements to talk with Kathleen or me or whoever we need to bring into conversation. Thank you for your participation. It\u2019s great to have a quarter like this, and we\u2019re really excited about our future. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, Regina, and good morning. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported our first quarter 2023 operating and financial results and a copy of today's press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. Also on the call today is Richard Adkerson, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Maree Robertson, our CFO; Mark Johnson, our Chief Operating Officer for Indonesia; Josh Olmsted, Chief Operating Officer for the Americas; Mike Kendrick, who leads our Molybdenum Business; Cory Stevens, who leads our Engineering and our Project Development Activities. I'll turn the call over to Richard who will make some opening comments and then we'll come back and review the prepared slide materials and then take your questions. Richard? Richard Adkerson : Thank you, Kathleen, and thank you all for joining us. Kathleen will review the results of the quarter and our outlook and I'll join our team in responding to your questions. I'm pleased with our global team's responses to challenges we faced in the first quarter. You all know, mining is a tough business, that's evidenced by the recent reports throughout the industry. Who you are in our industry is defined by your responses to challenges. I'm very proud of who we are at Freeport. Our team in Indonesia, once again, proved resilient in overcoming a major flood event. Now, we're accustomed to dealing with rainfall at Grasberg. It's located high in the mountains of New Guinea, one of the wettest places on the globe. We just celebrated our 56th anniversary of operating there. Our systems are designed to handle significant rainfall. The intensity of the event we experienced in January was unusually severe. Our established systems prevented major damages. Our team bounced back quickly by taking immediate actions to restore production and mitigate future risk and we have a great start in the second quarter with operations there. Kathleen and I have made a series of trips to Indonesia in recent months. For me, it's personally gratifying to experience the markedly more positive attitudes there about Freeport than in years past. All this resulted from the partnership we established with the government in 2018, the success we have achieved in the multi-year large scale development of our underground operations, and the positive outlook for copper in the future. Grasberg has now returned to rank as the world's second largest copper mine. Our net cash cost of production at Grasberg in the first quarter was a negative $0.08 per pound. We're now working positively with the government to extend PT-FI's operating rights beyond 2041 in a way that benefits all stakeholders. At Cerro Verde, our team negotiated through a volatile period of political turmoil in Peru. Our team rallied around the community and our workforce to handle the situation in a remarkable fashion. Our US team is stepping up to overcome the challenges associated with labor availability in the United States. We appreciate the commitment and drive of the global Freeport team to reach our gold in challenging circumstances. Copper markets continue to be supported by low levels of inventories, China's accelerating economic recovery, and the ongoing positive global demand drivers for copper. Our customers continue to buy all the copper we can produce and seek more. As we move forward, copper miners will be required to expand production to meet demand. At Freeport, we're in a strong position to develop new sources of copper supply to grow our business from our vast brownfield resources and also to grow our business from the rapidly developing leach technology and the supporting data analytics. At Freeport, we benefit from strong franchises and support from communities where we operate. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet. We have an exemplary track record for success and project and operations execution. Focused execution is the backbone of our culture at Freeport. We have a clearly defined strategy and a relentless drive for achieving long-term success. And Kathleen will now review our slides. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, Richard, and I'll start on slide three. You've probably seen, we published our Annual Report and our Sustainability Report today and the reports are available on our website. The theme of this year's Annual Report is The Power of Copper. It highlights the critical role that Freeport and our principal product, copper, play in powering the global economy and the growing uses of copper as the world decarbonize and re-imagines modern infrastructure to support a highly connected world. We're also proud to publish our annual Sustainability Report. We've been reporting on our comprehensive sustainability initiatives for 22 years now and transparency continues to be enhanced. The report summarizes our initiatives, our achievements, and the challenges that we face in managing the safety, social, and environmental aspects of our business, which are critical to our long-term success. We use international standards, best practices, and third-parties, such as The Copper Mark, to measure our performance and responsibility to our stakeholders. We hope you'll have the chance to review this information and engage with us on these topics. We'll turn to slide four, which summarizes our key operating and financial highlights in the first quarter. As previously disclosed, our Grasberg operations were temporarily disrupted in February, following a significant weather impact in our mill area. As Richard said, the team did a great job to safely restore production to normal levels in March. Despite the lower volumes compared with our estimates going into the quarter, our consolidated unit net cash costs were essentially in line with our guidance. Consolidated cost per unit averaged $1.76 per pound in the quarter as higher byproduct credits more than offset the volume impact. As Richard mentioned, notably, even with the disruption, Grasberg unit net cash costs averaged a net credit of $0.08 per pound, meaning, the gold revenues more than offset the cash costs of production. With the return to normal operations in March and a great start in April, we expect our volumes to be strong in the balance of the year. Our margins in the quarter were strong, our EBITDA totaled $2.2 billion in the quarter, operating cash flows, which were net of $500 million use of cash for working capital totaled $1.1 billion. We funded investments during the quarter of $1.1 billion. That included about $400 million for major mining projects and $300 million for the Indonesian smelter, which is being funded from proceeds from financing we raised last year. Excluding net debt associated with the smelter, we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in net debt. Our balance sheet, liquidity, financial flexibility are in terrific shape. The outlook is positive for free cash flow generation in the balance of the year. The next slide, Richard talked about the challenges we faced in the first quarter and we faced these across our global operations. Our teams executed well in the circumstances. And you can see on the left, the production impact of the weather event at Grasberg in February and the strong recovery in March. In Peru, we and other companies experienced a challenging environment earlier in the year associated with widespread protests, which impacted supply chains and transportation routes. Our team at Cerro Verde did a great job managing the situation efficiently and safely. Situation in Peru has improved in recent weeks and we're now operating at normal rates. In the US, we were challenged with ongoing labor shortages, extreme weather events earlier in the quarter and unplanned maintenance issues. We're working to improve productivity and reliability, working on skills development and pursuing technology and automation initiatives as we aggressively seek to recruit workers with ongoing tight labor market conditions in the US. The leach recovery efforts, which we'll talk more about, really helped to offset some of the shortfalls in mining rates and we're going to continue to build on this. Turning to the markets on slide six. Freeport is well positioned as a leader in the global copper industry. Demand for copper is expected to accelerate going forward with projections for demand to double by 2035. Copper is essential in electrification. Low carbon investments in renewable power and electrification are driving massive growth in demand. In addition, the initiatives by many countries from major infrastructure programs and the uses of copper for connectivity, data, and artificial intelligence are also growing demand drivers. At the same time, the ability of the industry to meet this rising demand is a real challenge. All of us can look back at this time last year when many were projecting the market to move to a surplus in 2023, pointing to the new projects that were coming online. As we look at the situation today, most analysts now project the market to be balanced this year even with the new projects, and longer-term, the projections are for very large deficits. Under this backdrop, we believe prices will need to rise to incentivize new supplies. And at Freeport, we benefit from a large reserve position, as you see on the slide, and an even larger resource position to grow our business in the future. We're strongly positioned to continue to support growing demand and are pursuing several of these initiatives to enhance production going forward. On slide seven, we talk about the molybdenum markets, and as we've discussed, in addition to being a leading copper producer, Freeport is the world's largest molybdenum producer. Last quarter, we spoke about the significant rise in molybdenum from $18 per pound in late 2022 to a high of over $38 per pound in the first quarter of this year. We realized $30 per pound for our molybdenum sales in the first quarter. The price rose sharply beginning in late 2022 in response of supply issues and favorable demand drivers in energy and aerospace sectors. The prices began to drop from the highs in recent weeks, partly related to improved supply. As we look forward, the demand drivers from moly are positive, and since moly is principally produced as a byproduct from copper mines, it's also subject to some of the same supply issues as we have in copper. Current price of moly approximates just over $21 per pound. We're really excited, moving to slide eight, really excited to talk today to give you an update on our leach initiatives, which Richard referred to earlier. Our efforts to increase copper production through enhanced recoveries from our massive leach stockpiles is continuing to gain momentum. Based on our results today, we're gaining increasing confidence in achieving our initial target of 200 million pounds per annum and have begun to model what the next phase could look like. On the left side of the chart, we summarize the various categories that make up the initial 200 million pound target, basically in three buckets. The first is, relates to heat, increasing temperatures within the stockpiles. The second is an initiative we call Leach Everywhere, which is focused on making sure the entire stockpile has the benefit of the liquid solution we use to leach copper. And the third category, which is really important, it involves data analytics using new data available through sensors used in a variety of ways, including optimizing the amount of solution use and the rate of application we use to achieve the best results. It's been proven that increasing heat in the stockpiles enhances recoveries. We've advanced the installation of covers on our stockpiles for heat retention and we've mechanized the process and that's allowed us to execute more efficiently. We now have over 30% of our massive stockpiles covered. These initiatives provide 30% of the targeted increase. The Leach Everywhere initiative makes up 50% of the uplift and uses targeted drilling to improve flow of the solution that may not be getting through the stockpile. We're also drilling injection wells to add the liquid solution to lower stockpile sections. The sensors we've installed and access to other technology used in oil and gas formations are providing new information on where additional leach solution would stimulate the process and support higher production. The data analytics works is providing new insights. We really haven't had the benefit of this in the past, and we're now able to get the benefit to determine the optimal operating protocols under various conditions of the stockpiles. The initial success of these initiatives adds production at low incremental cost and a low carbon footprint. In parallel with our initial activities, we've been doing substantial work on the drivers to stimulate leach production and have modeled results on what the next phase of initiatives could yield. We see an opportunity to add an additional 600 million pounds per annum from these initiatives, which would provide a total of 800 million pounds per year. That's the size of a major new mine without the capital intensity and a very low incremental operating cost. The three areas of focus are highlighted in the center of the slide and we're in various stages of development on each of these initiatives. We've got a lot of work to do to advance these initiatives and some of this requires further innovation, but we have a clear path to success in this program. We're evaluating opportunities to increase the temperature further by heating the liquid solution before application on the stockpile. We're evaluating options to do this using solar generated power, geothermal or other renewable sources at our mine sites to accomplish the additional heat requirement. We're also testing various additives that we're developing both internally as well as from third-party initiatives. And we're using artificial intelligence in our journey and in our evaluations to help expedite the process. We're also evaluating options to inject air into the stockpiles in areas that are not getting enough oxygen. Again, we have much more knowledge of what is going on within the stockpiles and are working to design solutions to restimulate copper production. Freeport is in an exceptionally strong position to lead the industry in this area with massive stockpiles currently under leach, ongoing mine leach, mine for leach activities and the latent tank house capacity that we have. This will be part of our growth plans as we go forward in addition to the organic growth that we have to develop new copper in traditional ways. And slide nine highlights the growth and development outlook. And as we look at growing copper demand and the limitations and risks and actionable greenfield project development, our strategy and development priorities are focused on extensions of our existing operations and our portfolio of brownfield opportunities. On slide nine, we show our near-term, medium-term and longer-term development options. Following the significant growth in recent years achieved through the successful Grasberg development, we're focused on advancing to next phases. In the near-term, we see the best options for growth and achieving our initial leach targets and actions to enhance productivity and reliability in our US operations. If we can get our mining rates up in the US, which we're working on, and hit our targets for asset efficiency and reliability, we have the opportunity to add an additional 200 million pounds per year with limited capital investment. In the medium-term, we've outlined a series of initiatives. The first includes the second phase of our leach project. We're also looking to expand our Bagdad mine in Arizona and expect to complete feasibility studies this year. We have a major opportunity in Chile at our El Abra project and we already have an existing operation and looking to expand it significantly. And we're in the process of developing a new 90,000 ton per day block cave mine in Indonesia called Kucing Liar, which is currently in progress and expected to commence initial production by the end of the decade. At Bagdad, we're making some investments, which are included in our new capital expenditure guidance to conduct early works in the tailings area to enhance optionality to move more quickly with the mill expansion project, following completion of the feasibility study. Longer-term and we're already working on these projects, as they require long lead times, we expect we'll have the opportunity for further major expansion in the Safford/Lone Star district where we have identified significant resource and we have a series of US brownfield projects that can be pursued. In Indonesia, Richard talked about the extension discussions we're having and the extension of our operating rights beyond 2041 would open the door for continuation of large scale mining and potential additional development options in one of the world's largest and highest grade copper and gold mining districts. We're in an outstanding position to continue our leadership role in supplying copper to a world with growing requirements. We're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach and focused on executing projects where we can create value for shareholders. On slide 10, we provide an update of our three-year outlook for sales volumes. We've updated the 2023 sales guidance to take into account the first quarter disruption and the impact of lower mining rates in the US. Despite the disruption at Grasberg in February, our gold volumes for 2023 are about 3% higher than prior estimates. We've incorporated the estimates for stronger gold recoveries than in our January forecast, and we're doing really well in that regard. The guidance for 2024 and 2025 is unchanged. But with continued success in our leach efforts, we have some upside to these estimates. On slide 11, we show, moving to cost, we show a comparison of our prior unit net cash cost guidance for 2023 compared to our current estimate. We currently estimate unit cash cost to average $1.55 per pound for 2023, that's slightly lower than our January estimate of $1.60 per pound. The impact of the lower -- copper volumes is offset by higher byproduct credits and a reduction in export duties in Indonesia associated with our smelter construction progress. Our assumptions for the key commodity based input costs are similar to the January estimates. We're starting to experience less inflationary pressures in certain areas than in 2022, particularly for energy, while labor cost, services and equipment components have increased. In the reference slides on page 23, you'll note an approximate 7% increase in site production and delivery costs for our US mines compared with prior estimates. This largely reflects a reduction in volumes in the US associated with the challenges we discussed earlier. And we've got ongoing initiatives to improve productivity there. Moving to our cash flows. On slide 12, we show modeled results for EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $4 per pound of copper to $5 per pound of copper. These are modeled results for 2024 and 2025 with our current volume estimates and our cost estimates and we hold gold flat at $2,000 and molybdenum flat at $18 per pound in these models. Our annual EBITDA under these scenarios would range from over $10.5 billion per annum at $4 copper to $15 billion per annum at $5 copper. And operating cash flows would range from $7.5 billion per year at $4 copper to $11 billion per year at $5 copper. We show some sensitivities to the various commodities on the right. And with our long-term long-life reserves and large-scale production, we're really in a position to benefit from future metals intensive growth trends and the prospects for increasing cash flows and cash returns under our performance-based pay-out framework. On slide 13, we provide an update to our capital expenditures. Current forecast and these exclude the Indonesian smelter project, which is being funded with cash that we released last year in a bond offering. But our current forecast for 2023 totals $3.5 billion. That's up from the prior estimate of $3.4 billion and capital expenditures for 2024 are currently forecast to approximately $3.3 billion. The change from our prior guidance principally reflects investments we're planning at Bagdad to jump start early works to support optionality for future expansion. The bad debt investments or projects that we categorize as discretionary and do not reduce the cash available for distribution under our pay-out policy as they will be funded with the remaining 50% of free cash flow retained for growth projects. On slide 14, we got some great pictures showing the construction of our new smelter in Indonesia. This is a major undertaking for us. It's impressive and it will be on a world-class scale. The project will become the world's largest single-line flash copper smelting facility and it's advancing rapidly. We expect to commission the project in 2024. The project will include a precious metals processing facility and an expansion of the existing nearby smelter and it will align with Indonesia's downstream policy and enable PT-FI to process all of its concentrates domestically. In closing, on slide 15, we summarize our financial policy, which is centered around three priorities with the cornerstone being a strong balance sheet and we've achieved that. Our balance sheet and liquidity are strong and provide significant financial flexibility for the future. We're executing the performance-based pay-out policy, which provides for 50% of our free cash flow to be allocated to shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share purchases and the balance available to invest in our projects. We'll continue to pay a base dividend and a variable dividend at a combined annual rate of $0.60 per share. And since commencing the performance-based pay-out policy in 2021, we've returned about 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders and it further strengthened our balance sheet along the way, providing capacity for funding new projects over time. We did not purchase shares in the first quarter, but have availability under our share purchase authorization to conduct purchases, pursuant to the policy and we have a positive outlook for substantial free cash flow generation in the future depending on prices and other factors. The three priorities of balance sheet strength, allocating cash flow to a mix of shareholder returns and organic growth, we believe will enhance long-term value for the benefit of our shareholders. Our global team is energized. We're motivated to continue building value in our business and we're executing our plans responsibly, safely and efficiently. Thanks for your attention and we'll now take your questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Christopher LaFemina : Hi. Thanks, Operator. Kathleen, Richard, thank you for taking my question. I actually have a bunch of questions, but I'll just ask one and then I'll get back in the queue. There's a lot of M&A activity happening in mining, obviously, at the moment, and copper seems to be a major focus. And I know -- I think Richard has talked a little bit about looking at M&A opportunities in the past, but you obviously haven't done much in recent years. And I'm just wondering with your overall philosophy is around M&A? Are there jurisdictions that you'd be focused on? Is it important to have operational synergies? Are there any kind of key criteria that you would consider or is it just really about being opportunistic? And then secondly, is M&A something that is increasingly on your radar screen just as a result of consolidation in the industry in general? Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Thanks, Chris. As you know well for a long time now, I've been saying that consolidation would come to our industry. It's inevitable because of the challenges in developing projects. And it's not just a price issue, it's really just the availability of actionable projects for companies to pursue and companies in our industry that are diversified companies have had copper at the top of their strategic list for a long time. It's notable of the overall lack of success in developing new projects. There have been a few, of course. So all those things come together and lead to what we're seeing going on right now with M&A activity. Now for us, we don't have a strategy of growing through M&A. We are focused on our large-scale inventory of reserves and resources that Kathleen described. And but that does not mean that we would not take advantage of opportunities that may arise. So we're not defining regions or any other criteria. We would only do something if it was clearly something that was value enhancing for our shareholders. So we're not in a position of looking for things to do. But now with our company having made such great progress in strengthening our balance sheet, completing the major underground conversion at Grasberg and advancing on all fronts, we would be in a position if an opportunity arises, but it would only be in that case. Christopher LaFemina : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Emily Chieng : Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. My question is just around the leaching technology that you've talked a little bit more about today. And I wanted to dig through the 600 million pounds of step change in leaching volumes there. I think as we talk about the third-party catalytical leaching technology, I think that's been deployed at El Abra and Bagdad currently. What percentage of that 600 million pounds does that account for? And perhaps could you talk to the time line to getting there? And whether or not this could mean the El Abra expansion mill expansion could be delayed further if there's a strong success there? Kathleen Quirk : Emily, it's Kathleen, and I'll let Cory Stevens fill in on this because he's leading the efforts. But in terms of the additional 600 million pounds, a portion of it could be through these additives, but it's important to note that the additives that we're pursuing are both internal and through third-parties. And we've got a trial going on with a relatively small stockpile at Bagdad with Jetti. And we've got some new initiatives going on with Jetti at El Abra. But the bulk of what we're outlining here is initiatives that we can pursue on our own there. It's really not -- there's a lot of innovation involved and technology involved, but it's not rocket science. And the sensors and data that we have now is pointing us to where the issues are, where is the solution not getting through the stockpile, where is the stockpile not getting oxygen to it. So these things can add -- once we identify the problem, we, as an industry, can fix -- can find a solution. And at Freeport, we have such big stockpiles. That's why we have such a big opportunity here. So the bulk of what we're talking about, the opportunity we're talking about is largely at Morenci. Morenci is -- you see -- you look at our 38 billion pounds and look at the percentage of Morenci and that's where the bulk of the opportunity is. But if we are successful with this, potentially at El Abra, it might, we don't know yet, but it might compete with traditional mill technology. But we're really looking at what's available now through third-parties, but our initiative and our objective is to find a way to solve this on our own because that's the best way to maximize the yields for Freeport. But, Cory, do you want to add anything to those comments? Cory Stevens : Yes, Kathleen, no, you said it well. So our R&D efforts, we've been chasing some internal leads that look very promising. And then in the first quarter, what we've been able to do couple our work with artificial intelligence and machine learning much like how big pharma uses to develop their new products in a way that's driving us to increase the breadth and scope of the candidates that we're looking for implementation. And then in parallel we're actually bringing in more capabilities to do quick tests and medium scale tests and in the field at scale tests, but that's where we're most excited and then coupling that with some of the temperature activities we see that our confidence is growing on that front. Emily Chieng : Great. That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Carlos de Alba : Yeah. Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Just on Indonesia. I wonder if you can give us perhaps an update on how the conversations are for obtaining the export license, the extension of the export license in June? And also any conversations that you may have had with the government and your local partner on extending the contract beyond 2041 ahead of time? Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Yes. Thanks, Carlos. It's all of these things are happening in parallel with each other. To get the contract extension approved and there's widespread support for it within the government, requires some procedural actions to deal with existing government regulations and then also to amend the IUPK that we were granted in December of 2018, that would be a fairly simple process. So we are really encouraged by it. The June date, it has to do with this broader issue the country is pursuing with downstreaming for minerals broadly. And so that's why that was there. We don't anticipate that will be something that would limit our ability to continue operations beyond June. Anything more, Carlos, to be specific on it. Kathleen Quirk : I'll just point out that our IUPK that we entered into that Richard referred to in 2018 allows us to continue exports through -- at that point contemplated December 2023. And that has some force majeure provisions, which clearly the delays that we've experienced related to COVID and supply chains are force majeure. So our IUPK allows us to do it, but we need to get the approval from the government to put in this regulation after the IUPK was signed to restrict exports in a broad range and it's not defined which minerals they're trying to achieve. But we're working with the government. We are keeping them informed and they're visiting our copper smelter site. They're very impressed with the progress that we've made. Unfortunately, it's not going to be finished. It will be -- the construction will be substantially complete by the end of this year, but it won't be completely finished. And so we'll need the ability to continue to export. And importantly with the alignment we now have with the government ownership, it's very important for the government revenues as well for exports to continue. So we're going to continue to work on it. We don't have the extension beyond June yet, but we do expect to get it. Richard Adkerson : And Kathleen is right that we have these legal rights that are documented, but I want to emphasize, we're working cooperatively with the government and not just pushing our legal rights and we're getting a good response from it. Carlos de Alba : Right. Okay. And just one clarification. For the extension beyond 2041 or the contract beyond 2041, is this something that requires legislative approval or is it just an executive decision, obviously, together with the ministries and all that? Richard Adkerson : The government will decide really how to document it. There is a path forward for it to be done without formally going through new legislation. We do benefit now by having strong support within the parliament of Indonesia, who visited our operations, the parliamentary group overseeing mining came to the US and visited us here. So I just want to emphasize the whole tone has changed. The President visited our operations in late August, early September and it was a very positive. One of the highlights of my career there in Indonesia was his visits and we're building off of this to find the right way forward and do it in a way that everybody wins from it. The government would win, the local community, the workforce, suppliers to our business. So that's how we're working together to see how can we go forward and makes nobody benefits from us having any kind of drop dead date on operations there. It would really be hard to envision. And this 2041 date was in our original 1991 contract of work was carried forward in the 2018 IUPK and we actually have not done significant delineation drilling to see the extent of the resource beyond what's been necessary to fill up the production profile through 2041. And yet, in doing that, we have a very substantial resource beyond that already identified. But I'm really excited about the opportunity to go in and drill to see -- in the 30-plus year history of Grasberg, it always has gotten bigger over time. And I'm confident as we do more drilling, it will continue to be, to grow and be bigger just because of the nature of the ore system there and the grades that are available to us, it's really exciting. And so that's what we want to achieve with the government is to get the extension granted then undertake an active program of delineation. We only report reserves through 2041 and this would give us a chance to develop reserves beyond that date and to develop -- and to come up with plans for developing those reserves for future growth. It's just a great long-term asset as a base for our company for its future. Carlos de Alba : All right. Thank you very much, Richard and Kathleen. Richard Adkerson : Okay. Thank you for your question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Brian MacArthur : Good morning. I just want to follow up a little bit on the leaching situation and I appreciate all the detail. I just want to clarify, I think, you said most of this was internal, so it's not Jetti. But then you made a comment about the bulk of its Morenci. Morenci is sort of 50% of the stockpiles, but there's a whole bunch of other North American stuff. Is there a tank house issue? Or is that 800 million constrained going forward by anything else? Or could it just be bigger if you can do stuff at Bagdad and Sierrita and everywhere else? Kathleen Quirk : Brian, we have latent tank house capacity across the business of about 1 billion pounds a year. And it's in different places. But that is what makes this so compelling is that there really isn't a lot of incremental capital involved in these initiatives. So historical leach production, you go back decades, has declined over time. And we're just having a resurgence of what it once was. And this new data available to us that's telling us what's going on within the stockpiles is providing us with a road map to kind of have a renaissance of the prior leach production. So if need be, we could invest in new tank house capacity, but the low hanging fruit is, we've got latent tank house capacity at many of these sites. So we're really approaching this across the footprint. But the highest impact is to-date has been at Morenci. And that will likely be the lion's share of where we get additional pounds. But we have opportunities across the footprint. We also have inactive operations and active leach stockpiles that we can look to in the future. But the first -- the lowest hanging fruit and the highest value is in places where we're already leaching. Richard Adkerson : Yes. Morenci is the world's largest leaching operation today, and it was where much of the modern leaching technology was originally developed decades ago. So I just wish I could have a good way of conveying the excitement of our team working on this. It's really fun to see. We're leaching everywhere and we're going to leach to the last drop. So it's -- and the benefits are just -- no permitting to do this kind of stuff. There's very little capital -- tank house capital, if it's necessary, is not significant in the bigger picture of things. And the climate -- the carbon emissions are -- so it's a winner on every respect, and that's why we're working cooperatively with other companies and with Jetti and focusing on what we can do on our own because we do it on our own, we capture all the economics for our shareholders. So it's a multifaceted deal and like I said it's really a lot of fun. It's injected a level of enthusiasm into our whole organization that's really fun to see. Brian MacArthur : I might be pushing it here. But just as a related thing, you also talked about North American staffing, asset efficiency of 200 million pounds. So that has nothing to do with any of this. That's independent. What actually is that part of the equation? Richard Adkerson : Well, it's not limited to the mining industry. Certainly, it's not restraining us with our efforts to advance leaching. But it's an issue that -- as I talk with other CEOs in the business roundtable, everywhere people are experiencing it. Some of it grew out of COVID in the way people are approaching life work styles as they go forward, but it's a real issue for us, and we're attacking it by aggressively recruiting for people, but also its spurring our efforts to see what can we do with technology to make our business less labor intensive. But it is a real issue in the US, not in Peru, Chile, Indonesia, but it's just a significant matter in the US. Kathleen Quirk : But, Brian, it's basically getting our mining rates up and also getting our plant and processing to reliability standards consistent with what we've experienced in the past. So some of the experience levels have impacted us for the reasons Richard just talked about. But this is -- these are things -- these are self-help items and we've already got efforts underway to work on it and a game plan for how we're working on, but it's an opportunity that we don't need to go do a major project to go get. And so, again, the leach initiative, the initial leach initiative and this self-help work that we're doing is some of the highest value opportunities we have in the near-term. Brian MacArthur : Right. And while 1 billion pounds, I guess, it's equivalent to being one of the biggest -- one of the top five copper mines in the world? Kathleen Quirk : Yes. Brian MacArthur : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Timna Tanners : Hey, good morning. I want to look at -- Kathleen Quirk : Hi, Timna. Timna Tanners : Thanks. I wanted to look at slide five and kind of the cadence as you described and kind of understand what the trajectory is going forward? So is the -- it sounds like the Peruvian situation has really improved from what we hear. So is that fully behind and we can expect this run rate going forward? I know you talked about labor issues continuing, but I assume the weather, we are not going to forecast interruptions there. So I just wanted to get a little bit more about the cadence you'd expect in the regions and any impact on costs that might be lingering? Thanks. Richard Adkerson : Kathleen, I'll start by just making a comment about Peru. There are different issues in different parts of the country of Peru. And the -- and our operations is located just off the outskirts of the city of Arequipa, in the Arequipa region. And while there were protests there, they weren't as large as a protest in other areas. And we did have some disruptions of personnel movement and supplies for a period of time. And in our region, it has improved. The issues have not been resolved in the country. And so that remains there as an ongoing risk. But as you look at this trajectory issue, I think, it's important to look at individual regions and see what's going on there and not assume that because we made such improvement that that's carried forward to the same extent in other regions. So it's complicated. This whole business is complicated, but that Peru is very complicated. Kathleen Quirk : And Timna, you can look at slide 26, and that has our quarterly sales volumes for the balance of the year. The first quarter was impacted by these disruptions, but also we had the conversion to tolling in Indonesia, which we had projected going into the quarter. But you can see where we expected to be -- where we expect to be on a run rate for the balance of this year. And you can see very, very strong recovery from first quarter in the balance of 2023. Timna Tanners : Anything on the cost side as a second part of the question, I had asked? Is that also kind of out of the woods for most of the group besides the labor issues? Kathleen Quirk : Well, the first quarter, we had $1.76, and we're projecting for the year to average $1.55. So our cost -- unit cost in the balance of the year will be less than they were in the first quarter. We talked about some of the inflationary items easing from last year and that's principally energy. We saw the big spike in energy starting around this time last year. And some of the other input costs that were exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine situation. Some of those things have declined in East and so that's that is helpful. But we still have labor or services costs that were contracted for some of our components, equipment components, all those things are still with us in 2023. So we've got some elements of relief and some elements of costs that are higher. They're no higher than what we estimated at the beginning of this year, but still higher than they were last year. Timna Tanners : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC. Please go ahead. John Tumazos : Thank you for taking my question. Could you give us some color on the February escalation $38 spot moly whether there was some specific shortage, probably there were some high purity customers that had to get the good moly? I noticed that the Spence concentrator began reporting moly output to Cochilco for January and presumably Quebrada Blanca will start in April and May. You were not the source of the supply increase, but maybe you have some insight as to where this -- where else the supply might have rebounded when the price doubled? Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : John, I'll comment and Mike Kendrick can add to it. But partially, what happened in the first quarter was some of the same supply issues from moly that impacted copper. And the situation in South America, particularly in Peru, did have an impact on supplies. And at the same time, we were seeing some strong growth in demand. So there's extreme tightness in the first quarter and some of that got relieved in Peru when things started to return to more normal operations. We continue to see, as we look forward, demand drivers for moly being positive in the supply side, which will fall a lot like copper is it's just a challenge to bring on new supplies. And many times, as you know, in a copper mine that has byproduct moly when people get into trouble with operating constraints. Copper is the one that people try to maximize and sometimes may moly isn't maximized in those scenarios. But that was, I think, the main thing that occurred from a moly perspective on supply. And Mike, I don't know if you want to add. There's other things that we should add to that. Michael Kendrick : No, I think you captured it very well, Kathleen. I mean when you -- I think it really highlights what a tight physical market moly is. And as a result, there's no attenuation when there's a demand need in any given week, and there's not supply available, you can see both rapid increases and rapid decreases through the system. And as to your question on quality, we're a large player in that area and we conduct that business under contract. So most of our high quality material has designated 100% all the time to those products. John Tumazos : Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Michael Dudas : Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. Kathleen Quirk : Good morning. Michael Dudas : As you indicated in your prepared remarks, you talked about observation there years ago. The market was in surpluses or balanced to maybe slight and what you witnessing talking about other and the fact that this consolidation may take attention away from growth capital and to acquisitive capital. What do you think the risk is a year from now that the market is there upside or downside risk towards supply given those dynamics as you work through it over the next 12, 18 months? Richard Adkerson : You were breaking up a bit, but you were asking about the supply side risk assessment, right? Michael Dudas : Yes, yes. Richard Adkerson : So if you go back several years when the projects that are now coming on stream were first announced there were to be massive. There was projected massive surpluses in this calendar year and calendar year '24-'25 and those projects got delayed for different reasons, COVID hit, and they're not having the major surplus situation this year as markets basically balance and looking '24 there's potential services. But there's not new projects of significance coming on stream after that. So I would say that the supply side risk is more -- much more on the downside. We've seen issues related to meeting production, projections being higher for various reasons. The Peru situation and operational issues like we had in Indonesia occurred in other places. So I think for -- if you look back for a long-term history, supplies projections tend to be -- the projections tend to be higher than reality when experience actually happens. And I think that's where we are now. It's -- we have this leaching project, which gives us some upside. But overall, the risk, I think, are more on the downside. Michael Dudas : Thank you, Richard. Richard Adkerson : Thank you, Michael. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Murphy with Barclays. Please go ahead. Matthew Murphy : Hi. Just a question on the cash flow statement. Non-controlling interest distributions were zero this quarter, which I guess it's happened a few times in the past, but what drives that? And in this case, is it -- should we assume that there's going to be a bit of catch up later in the year? Kathleen Quirk : The first quarter, we had some significant taxes that was expected. We had some significant taxes that we paid in the first quarter related to the prior year period. And so we did not have distributions in the first quarter as that was used to fund those expenses. But we do expect that you'll see that line item increase throughout the year. We're generating a lot of free cash flow at PT-FI and at Cerro Verde and that those funds will be distributed. So in terms of thinking about it, we do provide some guidance on the impact of non-controlling interest on our net income and the estimates for cash flow are similar to that, maybe a bit lower than the earnings impact, but somewhere in that neighbourhood. Matthew Murphy : Okay, That's great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Orest, may be on mute. Our next question will come from the line of Lawson Winder with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Lawson Winder : Thank you, operator. Good morning, Kathleen and Richard. Very nice to hear from you. Thank you for fitting in my question. I just wanted to touch on Chile where there's been some positive developments. Is the environment there now improving in the correct direction such that El Abra might look more promising for an expansion? And then could you just also please share your views on the outlook for the regulatory environment there for mining? Thanks so much. Richard Adkerson : Well, Lawson, it's still uncertain. And while there were some -- from our perspective, some positive developments that have occurred since this process started, we're still waiting to see where it ends up. There's fiscal issues relating to royalties and taxes. There are also regulatory issues related to water use and other impacts on the environment. And bigger picture is better than it has been, but there's still significant uncertainties that we and other miners will wait to see how they play out. Kathleen Quirk : We're doing some things now to maintain optionality. We're planning some investments in desalinization which will not only benefit the opportunity for us to extend existing operations, but also give us some ability for the potential mill project. As we talked about earlier, we're doing some work on leaching, and that could continue to evolve our expectations about the design of the new expansion project. So we're keeping options open. We're making some advances to enhance that optionality. But the project at El Abra is very strong. We are in the process of updating our capital cost numbers to reflect what the current environment is. But El Abra has a huge resource. We're talking about potentially increasing production there and you saw the numbers in the press release I mean in our slide presentation. And that project is likely a project that will get done. It's a question of -- it's not if, it's when. And we're working to keep the analysis updated so that -- and move forward with some of these initiatives to put us in a position to move more quickly when we make the decision. Lawson Winder : Thank you both very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bendik Folden Nyttingnes with Clarksons Platou Securities AS. Please go ahead. Bendik Folden Nyttingnes : Thank you. Looking at that potential doubling in demand within a 12 to 15 year timeframe, what's your thoughts on taking on one of those large scale resources in some of the more underexplored jurisdictions of the world and bring it forward as a greenfield project? Is that something you're looking at, at all, or will you rather focus your strengthened balance sheet on the organic growth pipeline and potential industry consolidation? Kathleen Quirk : Richard, I'll take that one. We're really focused on our organic opportunities, then you see the portfolio we have, we're really fortunate to have organic growth that some others not everyone has within our industry. And as we've looked at greenfield opportunities over many years, you haven't seen huge greenfield success. It's rare. It's not -- we're not saying it can't be done, we keep our finger on the pulse of what the availability of greenfield is. But our focus is on our brownfield opportunities, the leach opportunities we had, someone noted earlier that it's a major top line if we can get this leach opportunity to reality. And so our focus is more on the lower risk more certainty around our brownfield opportunities while continuing to monitor what's available in greenfield. We spent a little bit of money on greenfield exploration. But our focus, because of our pipeline and asset profile, is focused more on brownfield. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Christopher LaFemina : Hi. Thanks, operator again. So, Kathleen, you mentioned the increases in CapEx guidance relate primarily to early investments in Bagdad for future expansions. I think back in October, Richard had said that investment in growth was on hold because, obviously, the macro environment was not very good. So I'm just wondering, has anything changed in Freeport's view of the world over the last six months? Is it just that China has reopened? Is it because supply issues are getting worse or is there just no change and this was kind of the natural progression for these projects? Thanks. Kathleen Quirk : Not really any significant change. This really gets to optionality. The work that we're doing on -- the early works, a lot of it relates to tailings infrastructure that we would have to do anyway several years out, but we'd have to do any way to support Bagdad's life of mine plans. And so this is bringing some of that forward, so that if we do decide to move forward with Bagdad, we'll be in a better position to bring it on more quickly. But it doesn't change. We still have the challenges of Bagdad of just not only just economic uncertainties, but the challenges of just housing and people for the project. But this project, the acceleration of the tailings infrastructure will give us options as we go forward. And that's what this is really all about for us is maintaining optionality within our portfolio to be able to, none of this happens overnight, but to potentially move more quickly. And when I say more quickly -- Christopher LaFemina : Has your view about copper changed? Richard Adkerson : But having said that, and without underappreciating the uncertainties in today's world, I would say, for our industry, the economic situation has improved from where it was midyear last year. Throughout this, China's demand for copper in the second half of the year was strong. I believe it was the strongest second half that they've ever experienced. And we're encouraged by the GDP growth in 2023. We recognize the comments about it being driven by consumers and that there's continuing issues. Inflation has improved. And so I think the overall environment has improved in recent months. But as Kathleen said, that's not really what's driving our decisions. The Bagdad project faces worker issue, housing issues. Chile is restrained by continuing political uncertainties. But we're -- we believe all these projects will be needed by the world, they'll be very profitable for our shareholders. And so we're investing in them, planning for them and anticipating that the time will come when we execute on them. Christopher LaFemina : Great. Thank you. That's very helpful. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC. Please go ahead. John Tumazos : Thank you. Looking at slide 14, that includes the desalination plant, could you give us a little bit of background on that? It rains a lot, obviously, in Indonesia. Why were freshwater supplies not adequate? Could you have used saltwater for cooling? I'm assuming that most of the water is for cooling and the big smelter? Or is this sort of a community relations thing to not draw upon local water supplies? Kathleen Quirk : We looked at a number of options, John. This is not of water, and this isn't a big part of the project in terms of capital requirements. We thought this was the best option for reliable water for the project. But Corey I don't know if you want to add anything to that, but that was the thought process, but we did look into a number of options for water and designing the overall configuration. Cory Stevens : Yes. We looked hard at freshwater options. And when we make a decision around water, we're looking decades out in the future and what the social -- potential social impacts are going to be and what future demands are going to be and the renewability of those sources and came to the conclusion that desalinization was the best route and then you look at the capital cost differences to use saltwater versus desal and this became the most prudent route for us. John Tumazos : Thank you. Operator : I'll now turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. Richard Adkerson : We appreciate your participation and your interest. If you have further questions, contact David Joint, and we'll be happy to respond to them. We look forward to reporting in the future on our progress. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported our second quarter 2023 operating and financial results. And a copy of the press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. On the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman of the Board and CEO; Maree Robertson, our Chief Financial Officer; Josh Olmsted, who leads our Americas operations; Mark Johnson, who leads our Indonesian operations; Cory Stevens, who heads up our engineering, construction and technical services group; Mike Kendrick, who leads our molybdenum business; and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. We'll start the call. Richard will make some opening comments, and then I'll go through the prepared materials, our slide materials, and then we'll open the call to take your questions. So I'd like to turn the call over to Richard. Richard Adkerson : Thanks, Kathleen, and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us. The positive second quarter results, at outlook we're reporting today, reflect that our operational performance has been in line with our plans and our prior guidance. Our teams and Freeport's global operations are executing with focus, drive and enthusiasm, all hallmarks of the Freeport culture. Fundamentals in the global copper market remain positive. Despite the frequently expressed concerns about a global economic slowdown and issues in China, electrification is expanding with ongoing advances in alternative energy, electric vehicles, connectivity and supporting infrastructure. Global copper inventories remain remarkably low, and this is notable in the context of the concerns about the global economy in China. The current demand for copper is much stronger than headline economic data. While market experts have significantly varying views about the short-term outlook for the economy and for the price of copper, there's a growing positive consensus on the medium and longer term outlook based on projected demand growing faster than supply development. Freeport is extraordinarily well situated in these circumstances with our large scale currently producing assets, which we're focused on executing the ongoing positive performance and attractive pipeline for future growth from the large scale undeveloped reserves and resources already in our current asset base. Kathleen, we'll now summarize the quarter and our outlook, and then I'll be back along with our team to answer any questions you may have. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, Richard, and I'll start on Slide 3, where we summarize our key operating and financial highlights for the second quarter. Production results across the portfolio were strong in the second quarter approaching 1.1 billion pounds of copper and nearly 500,000 ounces of gold. Our copper sales were about 3% below our guidance as a result of administrative delays in obtaining PT-FI's export license approval. We expect that PT-FI will receive approval to resume concentrate exports over the next several days. Our unit net cash costs during the quarter averaged $1.47 per pound, and that was a little better than our guidance of $1.51 per pound. With average copper prices realized of $3.84 per pound in the quarter, we generated strong margins and EBITDA of $2.14 billion. Our operating cash flows totaled $1.7 billion, and that was substantially above our mining capital expenditures, which totaled $700 million roughly, and that excludes the smelter capital of approximately $500 million in the quarter, which is being funded from proceeds that we raised last year. The balance sheet liquidity, financial flexibility remain in great shape. Excluding net debt associated with the smelter, we ended the quarter with under $1 billion of net debt. You'll see that we completed and we conducted some additional open market purchases of our public debt in the quarter at prices below par. As we look forward, we're well positioned for strong results in the second half of the year of \u2013 as second half copper volumes are projected to be over 15% higher than the first half and second half gold sales are projected to be over 25% other than what we sold in the first half of the year. I'm going to move to Slide 4 where we showcase a few of the operational highlights that we are particularly proud of in the second quarter. At Cerro Verde, where we operate one of the largest concentrate sites in the world, the mill averaged 425,000 tons of ore throughput per day during the quarter. This was a site that was designed several years ago at 360,000 tons per day. And over time our team has found ways to improve efficiencies and will continue to do that in the future. At Grasberg mill rates averaged over 200,000 tons per day, it was 207,000 tons per day in the quarter, and that was processing very high grades of both copper and gold ore. That was significantly above the first quarter level and actually the highest average quarterly throughput in over a decade. All this ore is coming from our large scale, modern and efficient underground mines now. Notably, the large scale operation at Grasberg produced copper during the quarter at a net cash credit of $0.09 per pound, and it was just extraordinary performance. We are making steady progress on the smelter in Indonesia. This is an important initiative and we're now at 75% compared with 60% progress three months ago. Our project execution is going well, and our team is very focused on completing the project efficiently. Over the next several months, we expect to complete construction by the second quarter of 2024 and begin commissioning and ramp up over the balance of 2024. We are also happy to report ongoing progress with our leach initiative and that's particularly helping our sites in the U.S. During the second quarter, this effort yielded incremental copper of 29 million pounds, and that was over two times the level in last year's second quarter. We're about 60% of our targeted annual run rate at this level, and we are well on our way to getting to our target of roughly 200 million pounds of copper per year incremental from this initiative. We're going to talk later \u2013 about it later in the presentation, but our confidence is increasing in meeting the initial target and on the significant upside for this highly valuable initiative. Turning to Slide 5, and you've seen a lot of press reports over the last several weeks about the regulatory situation in Indonesia, and we're providing an update on recent regulatory changes in the country. As many of you know, Indonesia is highly focused on downstream resource development that's been evolving over many years, and that reflects the country's national strategic priorities. The evolution of this ultimately led to our agreement in 2018 to expand our domestic smelting and refining capacity in the country. In 2020, Indonesia passed the law restricting exports of certain minerals weren't all defined, but that was beginning in June of 2023. Given our IUPK license and rights, and progress on the smelter, we continue to work with the government to allow time for us to complete our projects, which were delayed by the pandemic. As we mentioned, the projects are well advanced and nearing completion, and we were really honored to host Indonesia's President, Joko Widodo, at our smelter site in June. Beginning in June and July of this year various ministries completed regulatory process to enable ongoing exports of copper concentrates through May of 2024 for exporters with more than 50% smelter progress, and we were over 70%. Last week, the trade ministry enacted legislation to allow the exports and now the administrative process we expect to receive formal approval to resume exports over the next several days. We are going to continue to work with the government to enable exports to continue in 2024 until the new smelter is fully ramped up and operational. The Ministry of Finance also passed regulations last week to increase the duties on exports for various products, including copper concentrates for companies with progress of more than 70% of the duty. The new duty rate is 7.5% for the second half of this year. Under our IUPK, which provides stabilized terms for taxes, royalties, and duties, duties are phased out after 50% progress. And so we're currently reviewing the IUPK provisions with the ministry and our engaged in discussions on this matter. To date, the production impacts on our operations from the shipping delays have been limited, and this has been more of a timing consideration between production and sales. We currently have a sizeable volume of copper concentrate at our port site ready for shipment, and we expect to work down inventories over the next several months. Moving to the copper markets on Slide 6 and Richard touched on this in his comments. Copper is the metal when it comes to electrification. And Freeport is really well positioned as a leader in the global copper industry. The short-term market situation is characterized by, on the one hand, favorable demand drivers from growing intensity in autos, renewables and data centers, and that's partly offset by slowing manufacturing growth. China remains the world's largest consumer of copper and even with the country's current economic challenges and the weakness in the property sector, copper consumption continues to grow and that's been bolstered by large investments in copper-intensive electrical grid and strong growth in electric vehicle production. Richard referenced the inventories, which are very low levels by historical standards, they're now lower than they were at the start of this year, and we see this as evidence of a tightly balanced market. As we look forward over the next several years, demand is expected to accelerate with third-party projections for demand to double by 2035. Investments in low carbon renewable power, electrification will lead to massive growth in demand. And in addition to that, the initiatives by many countries for major infrastructure programs and the uses of copper for connectivity, data, AI, those are also growing demand drivers. At the same time, the ability of the copper industry to meet this rising demand is a major challenge, and we are working very hard to increase our supplies as we look forward. We believe prices will need to rise to incentivize new supplies of copper. At Freeport, we benefit from a large reserve position and even greater resource position to be able to grow our business in the future. As I mentioned, we're really focused on continuing to support the growing demand, producing responsibly and we're pursuing several initiatives to enhance our production going forward. Moving to Slide 7. We provide an update of our three-year outlook for sales volumes. This is largely unchanged from our prior forecast. We've reduced our 2023 copper sales volumes by about 40 million pounds, that's about 1%, to take into account the shipping schedules in the balance of the year. The guidance for 2024 and 2025 is unchanged. And we do \u2013 we are focused on continued success in our leach efforts, which we believe have the potential to provide some upside to these estimates. Moving to the regional information on Slide 8. We show our projected 2023 volumes and unit net cash costs by region. Our business in the Americas, including the U.S. and in South America, comprise about two-thirds of our 2023 copper sales and all of our molybdenum sales, and Indonesia represents about one-third of the copper sales and all of our gold sales. On a consolidated basis from a cost standpoint, our unit net cash cost forecast of $1.55 per pound for the year 2023 is consistent with our prior estimate. We've had some small offsetting changes between the regions. But in total, we're continuing to project cash cost of $1.55 for the year. As we move through the year, we're continuing to experience improving cost trends for several of our commodity-based input costs, and we're seeing more stability in labor, services and equipment component costs. We remain focused on cost management and all of our ongoing initiatives to improve productivity to offset the cost increases that we've experienced in recent years. The estimates that were provided on Slide 8 assume that the export duties in Indonesia are unchanged from our existing duties. As I mentioned previously, the new regulations imposed higher duties than our stabilized rates under the IUPK and we're engaged in the discussions with the government to review this. We provided some sensitivities on potential impacts of the higher duty rates on this page, which you can see at the bottom would have a $0.07 per pound impact on consolidated unit net cash cost for the year, take into account the impact in Indonesia of $0.19 per pound for the year with the duty starting in the second half. On Slide 9, we updated our outlook for our margins and cash flows. And if we put together our projected volumes and cost projections, we show the modeled results for our EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $4 to $5 copper. These results on the slide are modeled using the average of our 2024 and 2025 volume and cost estimates, and we hold gold flat in these scenarios at $1,950 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $20 per pound, both of those commodities are slightly above that today. Annual EBITDA under these assumptions would range from about $11 billion per annum to $15 billion per annum at $5. The $11 billion was at $4, and our operating cash flows before working capital would range from nearly $8 billion per year at $4 copper and $11 billion per year at $5 copper. We\u2019ve got some sensitivities to the various commodities both the sales commodities as well as our input costs. On the right of the chart, we\u2019re well-positioned with our long-lived reserves, large scale production to benefit from future metals intensive growth trends. And we\u2019ve got prospects as we look forward for increasing cash returns under our performance based financial policy payout framework. Return to capital expenditures next, on Slide 10 where we show our current forecast for capital expenditures in 2023 and 2024, these include the capital that we\u2019re investing in the Indonesian smelter project, and those amounts are being funded from a debt offering we did last year, we\u2019ve got cash on the balance sheet and availability to support those investments and the detail of those expenditures are on Page 25 of the slide deck. But all in all on the non-smelter related investments, the \u2013 we\u2019ve had some timing adjustments moving some spending from 2023 to 2024, but the current forecast for the two years is pretty similar to what we had before. It\u2019s about 3% higher for the two-year period, and that that reflects some updated estimates principally for projects at Grasberg. We\u2019ve highlighted here on the slide discretionary projects, and these are the projects that are being funded with the 50% of available cash that\u2019s not distributed. Those totaled $2 billion over 2023 and 2024. And these are value enhancing initiatives that we\u2019ve got some details on 24 \u2013 on Slide 24 in our reference material, but value enhancing initiatives to improve our position as we look forward. We\u2019ll talk on development options and our growth on Slide 11. We\u2019re really focused as we said, on looking at the outlook for growing copper demand and looking at our brownfield strategy given the risk and actionability of greenfield projects, our strategy of developing our resources within our portfolio, we\u2019re focused on expansions of our existing operations and our broad portfolio of brownfield opportunities. We\u2019ve categorized the growth on Slide 11 and in near-term, medium-term and longer-term development operations options, and you can see in the near-term the best options for us, for growth are achieving our initial leach targets and the actions that we have particularly in our U.S. operations to enhance productivity and reliability. By increasing our mining rates in the U.S. through workforce additions, automation, and achieving higher targets for asset efficiency and reliability in our equipment and processing facilities, we believe we have the opportunity to add 200 million pounds of copper a year with very limited capital investment. We\u2019re very focused on the details of the reliability and asset efficiency that we\u2019re pursuing and see that potential as we look forward. We also outlined the potential of our leach opportunity beyond the initial target of 200 million pounds per annum. We talk extensively about this on our last call. We\u2019ve got very large areas under leach. We\u2019ve got new approaches and operating practices that we are deploying on this effort, and the more we work on it, the more optimistic we are about this opportunity is much larger than the initial 200 million pounds. We continue to see the clear opportunity of expanding the initial 200 million pounds of copper per annum to 800 million pounds of \u2013 per annum over the next three years to five years. We\u2019re continuing initiatives to increase heat to our stockpiles. We\u2019re continuing to enhance our ability to identify and deploy solution to areas of the stockpiles, which aren\u2019t getting adequate solution. And we\u2019re continuing our work on additives through internal testing, as well as looking at technology that others have with respect to additives. This is a major value opportunity, a major catalyst for us, and Freeport is one of the best place companies in the industry to capture value from it, and that\u2019s because of our large existing stockpiles with billions of pounds of copper still in them, our technical know-how and the ability of our team to deploy learnings quickly across the portfolio through our operational control of all the mines we have interest in. In addition to the leach opportunity, we\u2019ve got more traditional sources of growth that we are pursuing. We\u2019re continuing to evaluate the expansion of our Bagdad mine in Arizona. We\u2019re completing the feasibility studies on that expansion. We\u2019ve got the major El Abra opportunity in Chile, where we have an existing operation and very large reserves \u2013 resources that support future expansion. And of course, we\u2019re developing making progress with the 90,000 ton per day Kucing Liar block-cave in Indonesia, and that\u2019s expected to commence production by the end of the decade. At Bagdad, we\u2019re making some investments to advance tailings and other infrastructure to enhance our optionality for the project. And we\u2019re doing the same at El Abra looking at some investments and water infrastructure, not only that would support the current operation, but provide optionality for the large mill project in the future. After those two projects, we\u2019ve got an \u2013 big opportunity in our Safford/Lone Star district in eastern Arizona. We\u2019ve got current production there and have identified a significant resource that would allow us to make that district another cornerstone asset for Freeport as we look into the 2030 timeframe. We\u2019ve got a series of U.S. Brownfield projects that were also looking at a big opportunity for us as in Indonesia, where an extension of our operating rights beyond 2041, which were continuing to advance would open the door for long-term large scale mining beyond 2041 and potential reserve expansion and additional development options in one of the world\u2019s largest and highest grade copper and gold mining districts. We\u2019re \u2013 with these projects, we\u2019re in a position to continue our leadership role, supplying copper to a worldwith growing requirements, we\u2019re going to continue to be disciplined in our approach, but focused on executing the projects where we can create value for shareholders. On the last slide, we \u2013 on Slide 12, we reiterate the financial policy priorities. Those are really centered on our strong balance sheet, which we have our cash returns to shareholders and investments in our value enhancing growth projects. The balance sheet is solid. We\u2019ve got very strong credit metrics and flexibility within our debt targets to execute on projects. At the same time, we\u2019ve distributed over $3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases since commencing this performance based policy and have an attractive future long-term portfolio that will allow us to use a portion of our cash flow to build long-term value for shareholders. Richard mentioned the team is energized, motivated, and we\u2019re focused on continuing to drive value in our business in executing these plans responsibly, safely and efficiently. Thanks for your attention, your participation and operator we\u2019ll now open the call for questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead. Alex Hacking : Yes. Good morning, Kathleen and Richard. Kathleen Quirk : Good morning. Alex Hacking : Yes, morning. So I guess, I only have one question. I saw a press release this morning about a strike at Cerro Verde, 72 hours. Could you maybe give us some context on that? Thanks. Richard Adkerson : Sure. Josh, you\u2019re on the line. Why don\u2019t you respond to that? I was just at Cerro Verde and I got to tell you, I was so proud of what the team\u2019s done down there. Josh Olmsted : Yes. Good morning. One other thing \u2013 we really pride ourselves on our open and ongoing conversations with all of our employees and the union. There\u2019s we have two unions at Cerro Verde. And this is one of the original unions, which accounts for roughly 28% of our total workforce. And it\u2019s just been some ongoing conversation that we\u2019ve generated dialogue for \u2013 we have some \u2013 a meeting with the labor department tomorrow to try and continue to foster the conversation and avoid the potential strike there. But we\u2019re in \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to have those dialogues and we\u2019re working through and being as open and transparent as we can with the union to work through and address any of the issues. Alex Hacking : Okay, thanks. Richard Adkerson : We have a long history in Peru and Cerro Verde of being able to deal. Sometimes we get affected by strikes, not related to our operations and so forth, but our team is prepared for it. And we\u2019re hopeful that this thing gets resolved is not really a major substance issue in my observation on it. And our team will be able to manage our way through it if in fact we have to deal with it. Alex Hacking : Okay. Thanks, Josh. Operator : Your next question will come from the line is Christopher LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Christopher LaFemina : Hi, Richard. Hi, Kathleen. Thanks for taking my question. I actually have quite a few questions about the situation in Indonesia, but limited to just two for now. So the first question is, our understanding at the beginning of July is that the concentrate storage areas were nearly filled and you would likely have to shut down the operations if you did not have an export license imminently. And I\u2019m wondering, first of all, whether you\u2019ve been able to continue to operate at Grasberg or if the mines are shut down for now. And the second question is just related to the export. Sorry, you want to answer that one first? Richard Adkerson : Let\u2019s answer your first question. Yeah, let\u2019s go ahead and answer that. One of the complications we had with this is that the domestic smelter at Gresik that PT Smelting owns, which is not affected by any sort of export issues. It was undergoing a maintenance \u2013 a plant maintenance turnaround. So there was limited concentrates we could ship domestically. That has been completed and now we\u2019ve begun returning to shipping to Gresik. We haven\u2019t shut down at all. We\u2019ve \u2013 our team is adjusted to the situation by advancing some plant maintenance activities that we had for the second half of the year. And while the storage facilities were approaching their limits or meeting their limits, we have not had a significant \u2013 we\u2019ve had some impact, but not a significant impact on operations. We anticipate resuming exports very shortly and we have a lot of concentrate that\u2019s been produced that\u2019s on site that\u2019s ready to sell and we\u2019ll be moving that to market. Christopher LaFemina : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you for that. The second question is regarding, I think Kathleen said the export license is days away. And obviously as per the IUPK, smelter construction passes 50% it means no more export duties for you. But under this new regulation, there will be an export duty. And I\u2019m wondering if the export license will be granted to you, even if you were disputing having to pay the new hire export duty because you potentially are protected via the IUPK. Kathleen Quirk : Well, in order to export\u2026 Richard Adkerson : All indications are and expectations are is that we will be able to export. We\u2019re continuing discussions right now to present our case. And if we can resolve it, that would be the best outcome. If we can\u2019t, we\u2019d begin to exports and then pursue our legal rights separately. Christopher LaFemina : Great. Thank you for that. Richard Adkerson : Kathleen, you have something to add? Kathleen Quirk : No. That\u2019s great. Thank you, Richard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carlos de Alba with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Carlos de Alba : Yes. Good morning, Kathleen and Richard. So my first question is on Cerro Verde. You are operating quite well there and the company, if I understand correctly it doesn\u2019t really have a significant debt anymore. So with the cash regeneration there, what are your plans? Do you expect to continue to pay dividends? You already announced I think twice payments in the second quarter. You pay more in the third quarter. You typically in the past did pay in the second and fourth quarters. Should we expect another payment in the fourth quarter? So in 2023. Just overall, what can you tell on Cerro Verde? And I\u2019ll come back with the second question. Kathleen Quirk : We\u2019re \u2013 I think Carlos you characterized it correctly. We\u2019re essentially distributing cash flow out of Cerro Verde. We\u2019ve done very well on the debt side. And from time to time, we reserve cash for items that we know about, obligations that we need to pay or items that we know about. But we expect to continue to generate cash flow at Cerro Verde. And to the extent we don\u2019t have obligations to pay that out to shareholders. I don\u2019t have \u2013 we don\u2019t have a decision at this point exactly what the cash flow and dividends will be quarter by quarter at this point, but we do expect to continue and distribute cash out of Cerro Verde. Carlos de Alba : Thanks, Kathleen. And then the second question is regarding CapEx. Your overall CapEx is not changing much as you already mentioned. But when I looked at the individual projects, I did notice that the PMR in Indonesia as well as the Grasberg mill recovery project increased CapEx 10% \u2013 10% to 20% higher than in the last update. So I wonder if you can provide some comments as to what is driving that. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. We did have an increase in our precious metals refinery an updated estimate for this precious metals refinery. It is an operation that is relatively small compared to the overall capital. But as we\u2019ve gone through more engineering the cost estimates have increased a little different than the big project, the Manyar project where a lot of things were ordered, a lot of things were put in place prior to the big rise in inflation. And so to date, we\u2019ve been on that project we\u2019ve been pretty good at maintaining the cost estimate. So the bigger \u2013 the bigger project we had better terms on components, et cetera. But we are getting hit with some increases related to the precious metals refinery. The copper cleaner with all the projects going on at Grasberg, the mill project, the project we\u2019re doing for power, the filter plant we\u2019re doing at port site. The availability of experts and contractors has been slower than what was originally projected. And the project has taken a little longer, which is impacting the cost. But there\u2019s nothing, materially different about what we\u2019re doing there. It\u2019s just in this environment things are taking a bit longer and adding to the cost. But I do want to have a shoutout to our team managing the bigger smelter that bigger spend is, they\u2019re doing a great job in managing that, that project. Carlos de Alba : Thank you. Richard Adkerson : And Carlos, you know this industry well enough to see what\u2019s been going on with project costs around the globe. And I joined Kathleen and complimenting our smelter team, but our overall operations team, our supply chain management, you see what our cost performance is in a world that\u2019s still affected by inflation. I mean, commodity related costs are down, but overall we are taking that and running it through with all of our suppliers. And when you look at our operating cost and our project cost, I\u2019m really proud of our operating and supply management teams for the good work they\u2019re doing. Carlos de Alba : Yeah, definitely. Thank you, Richard. Thank you, Kathleen. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, Carlos. Richard Adkerson : Thanks, Carlos. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Timna Tanners : Hey, good morning everyone. Kathleen Quirk : Good morning. Richard Adkerson : Good morning. Timna Tanners : Wanted to speak in too, but this one is really high level, and I know we\u2019ve talked a lot about Indonesia in the short-term, but there\u2019s also the broader issue of the additional 10% stake they\u2019re asking for and the renegotiation IUPK further out. But I just sense that compared to five years, six years ago when you seemed a bit more concerned about the relationship with Indonesia, it seems like you\u2019re not as concerned this time. So, I just wanted to see if you could add some more color to that. Is that indeed the case? And maybe why? And how much time do we have, I guess before we really need to think about and settlement or a decision on this in the near \u2013 is it near term or is it medium term? Richard Adkerson : So, Timna, let me correct one thing you said, there\u2019s no renegotiation of the IUPK. Our current IUPK runs to 2041 and we have no rights beyond that. And that was negotiated after a lengthy period and settled in 2018. And the settlement in 2018 has proved to be extraordinary positive for all stakeholders. The government of Indonesia, which acquired Rio Tinto\u2019s interest during that process achieved its goals of getting a 51% equity ownership interest, and together with taxes, royalties, and other fees has essentially a 70% interest in the economics of the project. Through that FCX retained its interest, because it was already burdened by the Rio Tinto joint venture interest. And then since that date, we\u2019ve successfully completed the conversion from the open pit to this underground mine and you can just see the track record that our team\u2019s achieving with that. And over that period of time, copper prices have been good, all stakeholders have benefitted. Now, when the President and when you talk about the relationships, a key factor in that was when President Joko Widodo visited our job site in Papua the end of August, early September, the first Indonesian President to do that since Suharto did in the early 70s. He was very positive about what he saw there, about the progress we\u2019re making, about the extent of progress we made in increasing Indonesian management, Indonesian employees of Papuans that are working in our operations. It\u2019s \u2013 that was a key point in helping to build on the 2018 deal and making relationships so much more positive. Now, we all -- we have a mutual understanding that this operation needs to be run in a way that maximizes the resources that are available there. And having a drop dead date for an operation like this of 2041 is not beneficial to anyone because the exploration, delineation long-term capital planning needs to be factored, taking into account the resources that are available there. So, we had no rights to provide a basis for going forward beyond 2041. We\u2019ve had items for discussion, including an additional ownership interest for Indonesian government to deal with, and we\u2019ve agreed to support Papuan businesses to do things of that nature. So it is much different than the nature of the discussions we had going into 2018 where there was really contentious views and opposing views on various subjects that were all settled. Now we're in a mode of where there's a mutual recognition of the benefit for all stakeholders for us to plan this operation beyond 2041. And I have a lot of confidence we'll be able to achieve it. Is that you have any follow-up on that, Timna? Timna Tanners : Yes. I think\u2026 Kathleen Quirk : I just want to add\u2026 Timna Tanners : Go ahead. Kathleen Quirk : Timna, I was just going to add that a big change from maybe historically when you were thinking about it is the alignment we have \u2013 better alignment we have with the government, the state-owned enterprise, there we owns 51% of the shares, and of course we pay taxes and royalties. So the economic interest of the government in this operation is much greater than it was. And so the alignment is very positive as we look forward to create this value that Richard is talking about beyond 2041. And when we talk about beyond 2041 and the opportunity, this allows us really to think about the asset and opens the door for development much greater than what we were planning before because as Richard said, the reserves don't end in 2041. We see a lot of opportunity in using the infrastructure that we already have to further development. And the 10% \u2013 the share thing that you read about, what we were engaged in is looking at preserving what we have through 2041, but compensating the government in some way for that extension beyond 2041. So again, like we did in 2018, this would be only done if we could find the right win-win for both Freeport and the government, which we think we can. Timna Tanners : That's helpful. I guess\u2026 Richard Adkerson : Yes. That's a good point, Kathleen. Timna Tanners : Yes. Richard Adkerson : The 10% would only come into play after 2041. And a key factor is under the 2018 agreement, Freeport-McMoRan manages, controls the management of the operations and everybody's happy with that. There's widespread recognition in the government of just how complicated this business is, and they're very complementary and pleased with our \u2013 the way we're running the business. So it's really a good partnership. Timna Tanners : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Michael Dudas : Good morning, Kathleen, Richard. Kathleen Quirk : Good morning, Mike. Richard Adkerson : Good morning. Michael Dudas : Kathleen, you mentioned, you want some debt back at a discount I guess during the quarter and certainly the dividend plan is in place. But as you look into the second half of the year and the CapEx and with the anticipated cash flows might be, how do you \u2013 how's the Board thinking about share repurchases since it appears you refrain from that during the first half? It's evaluation opportunistic, just balance maybe you guys shed a little bit more light on that as we move the second half of year, especially if copper prices into sharply recover? Kathleen Quirk : Yes. Well, if copper prices sharply to recover, we're going to be generating a lot of free cash flow. Under the policy, we're distributing 50%. And if you go back cumulatively to where \u2013 when we started it in the second half of 2021, we've distributed over 50% between the dividends and the share buybacks. With improved market conditions, that's going to give us a lot of leverage to free cash flow and give us the ability to consider how we deploy that, whether it be share buybacks, dividends, et cetera. And so we're following the policy. We're keeping our debt very low. The cash flow that we've generated since the policy started, over 50% has gone to shareholders, but the other 50% is some of it's still on our balance sheet because we've got projects earmarked to fund. So we're following the policy. We think it's a great balance between balance sheet, capital returns to shareholders and investing in our long-term growth and we're going to continue to follow that. Michael Dudas : I appreciate that. Thanks, Kathleen. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of\u2026 Richard Adkerson : Mike, we believe the shares \u2013 I just want to say, Mike, we believe the shares are a good value at today's levels. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Brian MacArthur : Hi, good morning. I just want to follow up and thank you for your answer on Timna\u2019s question. But when you convert it from underground or from open pit underground, I mean we started building that I think in 2005 and it took 15 years. So under this long-term planning for 2041, when do you actually to efficiently develop the ore body post-KL? Are we talking you need to have this all figured out 15 years in advance like before, so you have to start in 2026? So what sort of time horizon are you looking at to be efficient going forward? Kathleen Quirk : Brian, that's exactly the point that we're making and I think as we talked about earlier with the government now owning a big piece of PT-FI and participating in our \u2013 in our business and our operating committee, they understand that this has to be planned with long-term horizons. And so there's not a drop dead date but the sooner the better because the closer we get to 2041, the more \u2013 the more difficult it would be to \u2013 to change the \u2013 change the outcome. So that's \u2013 that's a point, a really important point and the government has \u2013 has recognized this more so now than they ever have and that gives us the opportunity to have this \u2013 have this discussion about moving forward with a \u2013 with the extension. The smelter is a big part of that. We with the \u2013 with the smelter completion, the regulations in Indonesia now allow for companies with \u2013 with refined processing facilities to be able to apply for longer term horizons. And so the regulatory environment is recognizing that and \u2013 and that's all part of what we're \u2013 we're trying to achieve. It's not a specific date, but the sooner the better in terms of long-term planning. Richard Adkerson : And Brian just let me say because of the IUPK term, we only report reserves through 2041. But with our work to develop our mine plans to 2041, we've already identified production that would extend production of significance that would extend beyond that. And Mark Johnson our PT-FI team are already started the process of looking at delineating these ore bodies to see what opportunities are there. And so we would as we did, as you said in the early 2000s for \u2013 for this underground conversion, we would get immediately in developing the plans long-term for extending production. Kucing Liar, we know goes far beyond that and we haven't defined the limits of the Grasberg Block Cave or the \u2013 or the other ore body Kathleen have alluded. Kathleen Quirk : Deep MLZ. Richard Adkerson : Deep MLZ, that's \u2013 that's the same ore system that Freeport began mining in the early 1980s and it's just continued to go further and further at depth. So we're really excited about it and I've been involved in this ore body for so many years and one continual thing is been, it's always gotten bigger than anybody anticipated that would and so it's \u2013 it's really an exciting opportunity for us and for the government. Brian MacArthur : So can I just ask to follow up on that, because that's what I was trying to figure out; is the additional or past 2041, is it depth that you said DMLZ KL bigger or is it there's another whole area where you have to put in another whole say common infrastructure project. There's something else out there because originally the original drilling in the area was all cut off and whatever. Is this depth or is it just more development underground or is there another whole like if I call it the whole like original common infrastructure that would've to be put in? Kathleen Quirk : Well, initially it's that... Richard Adkerson : Well you wouldn't have to do a whole common infrastructure. I mean, it would be something that would utilize what we have there and extend beyond that. But the truth is we have a lot of indications of things, but we really need to do more active delineation drilling to see what's there and then develop our plans around that. Kathleen Quirk : And Brian, if you look at our \u2013 our resource statement and the 10-K, you'll see there's a lot of resource there that's not in reserves and some of that's material that, that comes after 2041, some of it would require some additional processing type handling because some of it has high pyrite content and that \u2013 that could be a challenge and an opportunity for us. But initially the opportunity really is a Deep MLZ we're already starting to conduct some \u2013 some exploration below Deep MLZ. So really from what we know about, we think there's a lot of opportunity. And then with a lack of mine extension we'll have \u2013 we'll have incentive to go do more exploration because we haven\u2019t done exploration for \u2013 20 plus years, given we already had enough reserves to get us through 2041. So it\u2019s a great opportunity for, as Richard said, both the government and for Freeport. And this is an asset that, that\u2019s really needed, in the global copper industry really, really important. Brian MacArthur : Great. Thanks very much. Richard Adkerson : Brian. And you\u2019ll remember this \u2013 you\u2019ll remember this Brian, because you were around then. The \u2013 when we first started developing this underground operations that 20 years ago we were shooting for 120,000 tons a day through our mill. Look what we did in this quarter, 240,000 tons a day. So that\u2019s just the nature of this great ore body. Brian MacArthur : Totally agree. As you said though, takes a lot of long term planning too. Richard Adkerson : That\u2019s the nature of our business. Brian MacArthur : Great. Thank you very much for all that color. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cleve Rueckert with UBS. Please go ahead. Cleve Rueckert : Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019ve just one quick follow-up from me, and it\u2019s a little bit more near-term focus than the discussion we\u2019ve been having, but in Indonesia, can you just help frame the next 18 months, the approval that you expect to get in the next several days. How much of an extension does that get you on your ability to export concentrate? And then based on sort of the smelter construction timeline and the ramp, and when would you expect to see shipping concentrate from Indonesia such that, this concentrate export license, isn\u2019t really an issue anymore? Kathleen Quirk : The regulation \u2013 the regulation that\u2019s just been adjusted goes through May of 2024. And we have export quotas that the government approves in connection with their review of our annual work plans. So our current quota that we\u2019ll be shipping under goes through the year end this year of 2023, we\u2019ll have to update that work plan, which we is just an ordinary course thing, which we do in the fall and that will allow us to increase the, what we the quota to get us through May. And then in connection with that, and we\u2019ve already been discussing this with the government while the smelter we expect will be, mechanically complete in the second quarter of next year, you still have a multi-month period throughout 2024 and it\u2019ll be reducing over time, but a period of time where the smelter needs to be ramped up. And so that part we will continue to review with the government. The big thing is to get mechanical completion done and we believe the government will continue to work with us to allow for some exports beyond that. But we\u2019ll have to \u2013 we\u2019ll have to work that through with the government. But really by the end of next year we are \u2013 we\u2019re expecting that the essentially we\u2019ll have enough capacity to deal with our production out of PT-FI. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on doing. We talked about this earlier. The project team is doing a really good job. We\u2019re very pleased with our EPC contractor there. We\u2019ve got thousands of people on the ground and if you see the pictures, it\u2019s really, really developing. We know and recognize that smelter operations can be complex and we\u2019re doing a lot of work and planning around operational readiness. But our target is to get, the full ramp up done as we, by the end of next year. Cleve Rueckert : Got it. All right, great. Thank you for that. Appreciate it. Operator : And I\u2019ll now hand the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Kathleen Quirk : Well, thanks everyone for your participation. If you have any follow ups, feel free to contact David and we look forward to continue to report to you on our progress. Richard Adkerson : Thank you all. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our conference call. Earlier this morning, FCX reported our third quarter 2023 operating and financial results. And a copy of the press release and slides are available on our website at fcx.com. Our call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. I'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. On the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman of the Board and CEO; Maree Robertson, our Chief Financial Officer; Mark Johnson, Chief Operating Officer for Indonesia operations; Josh Olmsted, Chief Operating Officer for the Americas, Mike Kendrick, who heads our molybdenum business; Cory Stevens, who leads our technical services and engineering and construction group; and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. We are going to start with Richard. He\u2019ll make some opening comments, and then we\u2019ll be reviewing the slide materials, and then we'll open the call for your questions. Go ahead, Richard. Richard Adkerson : Good morning. Yes, good morning. Thanks, Kathleen. As Kathleen said, she's going to review our operations and financial results for the third quarter. Big picture, we had very strong operations performance and this was really notable in face of a number of challenges we faced at different locations around the world. Once again, Team Freeport answered the bell and rang through. Stating the obvious is a complicated geopolitical and macroeconomic world. Freeport family around the world is sad for the poor people in Israel, in Gaza, and in the Ukraine and praying for a resolution to those conflicts. Macroeconomic factors with higher interest rates are negative for the price of copper and Freeport's equity. It goes without saying our business by design, by strategy, is correlated to the price of copper in response to the recent lower copper prices. We are supported by having a strong balance sheet, which we're committed to maintaining, and by having the ability to manage our capital cost and operations to be responsive to the price environment. We remain very confident about the long-term outlook for copper and for our company's equity. The current situation does nothing but bolster the longer-term outlook for copper prices as a commodity and for our future returns to Freeport shareholders. We look forward to answering your questions and I'll turn the call over to Kathleen to review our results. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, Richard, and I'm going to start on slide three where we summarize our key operating and financial highlights for the third quarter. We delivered another quarter of strong execution, production results across the portfolio were solid, totaling \u00a31.1 billion of copper and over 500,000 ounces of gold during the quarter. Our copper sales were 8% above our estimates going into the quarter, and despite strong gold production, our third quarter gold shipments were slightly below previous estimates. That reflected timing associated with some administrative approvals in Indonesia, but this is expected to turn and set up for higher gold sales in the fourth quarter. Our unit net cash costs on a consolidated basis averaged $1.73 per pound in the third quarter that was similar to the year ago quarter. The increase compared to our guidance of $1.61 per pound largely reflects the impact of export duties in Indonesia, which we continue to review and discuss with the Indonesian government. With average copper prices of $3.80 per pound in the quarter, we generated EBITDA of $2.2 billion. Our operating cash flows, which were net of $500 million in working capital uses, totaled $1.2 billion, and those exceeded our mining capital expenditures, totaling $800 million, which exclude capital associated with our smelter project, totaling $400 million in the quarter, and that's being funded from proceeds that we raised last year in a financing transaction. We're making steady progress on the smelter projects in Indonesia. The construction project on the new greenfield smelter is 84% complete, and we're on track to begin ramping up during 2024. Richard talked about our balance sheet, our balance sheet, liquidity, financial flexibility remain in great shape, excluding the net debt associated with the smelter projects in Indonesia. We ended the quarter with $800 million in net debt. As we approach the end of 2023, our team remains focused on continuing strong and safe execution of our operating plans. And we expect to have another quarter of strong production results. And we're going to continue to advance several important initiatives to drive long-term value in our business. Moving to the next slide, slide four, we talk about copper markets. And as Richard mentioned, the long-term fundamental outlook for copper remains compelling, characterized by rising demand associated with global investments in electrification and limited supplies. In the short term, copper prices have been impacted by macro sentiment tied to rising interest rates, U.S. dollar strength, and sentiment on the global economy. Copper inventories on exchanges have risen in recent weeks, and that follows a multi-year period of declines. When we look at the overall inventories on the exchanges, they remain low by historical standards and in relation to the growing size of the market. The reality on the ground, when we look at the macro sentiment, we also need to look at the reality on the ground. And the new structural demand drivers for copper are mitigating traditional cyclical uses. In the U.S., several of our customers are reporting growth in power cable and building wire for utilities and data centers and rising demand from the automotive sector. There are pockets of weakness tied to residential housing, but this is being offset in other sectors. China's consumption continues to grow despite the country's weak property sector, supported by massive investments in wind and solar and growth in electric vehicle production. And there are recent signs we're seeing that economic activity is picking up in China. We're also seeing growth in copper consumption in India, which has historically used less copper per capita than other countries. We can't predict short-term macro forces that have heavily influenced the market, but our conviction for the long-term fundamental outlook remains strong. Copper is the metal when it comes to electrification and Freeport's well-positioned as a leader in the global copper industry. When we look at the long-term, we're looking at the next several years where demand is expected to accelerate with third-party projections for demand to double by 2035. At the same time, the ability of the copper industry to meet this rising demand is a major challenge. The recent weakness in price combined with higher capital costs to develop new mines are making it more difficult to justify new project development, which is essential to the future. With this backdrop, we believe the current price is not sustainable and prices will need to rise to incentivize new supplies. At Freeport, we benefit from a large reserve position and an even larger resource position to grow our business in the future. We're going to take a long-term view and also be mindful of the short-term pressures on the market. Moving to the next slide, on slide five, we want to highlight some of the key operational drivers for our business during the quarter. In the U.S., our leach innovation initiative where we're deploying new operating practices to traditional leaching is showing tangible progress. Incremental copper from these incentives totaled 46 million pounds in the third quarter. This is 90% of our initial targeted run rate of 200 million pounds of copper per annum. We see ongoing opportunities for additional scale as we aggressively advance this highly valuable initiative. Additionally, we're continuing to focus on enhancing productivity in our U.S. mining and milling operations. We know there's opportunity here to improve and it's a key focus area for us. At Cerro Verde in Peru, where we operate one of the largest concentrate sites in the world, the mill averaged over 430,000 tons per day during the quarter. That was a new quarterly record. You will recall this is a site that was designed at 360,000 tons per day. Overtime, our team has found ways to improve efficiencies there. We are really proud of the Cerro Verde team. At Grasberg, our mill rates averaged 207,000 tons per day for the quarter, processing high grades of copper and gold ore. The production for the quarter exceeded 400 million pounds of copper and over 500,000 ounces of gold that was in a single quarter, demonstrating the size and scale of this operation. We had several days of the mill throughput in excess of 220,000 tons per day. And a highlight of the quarter was the performance of Grasberg Block Cave. We mined from that ore body over 130,000 tons per day, on average. We installed a new gyratory crusher at the Grasberg Block Cave, which gives us the ability to process more material from that large ore body. And we recently reached new records of over 160,000 tons a day. We're working to complete the new SAG mill at Grasberg. We're expected to complete construction by the end of the year. And that'll give us more opportunities in the future to ramp up our mill rate even further. Turning to slide six, we talk about our growth initiatives. And as we look at this situation where we have growing demand for copper over the next several years, and the limitations and the high capital intensity and risk for greenfield projects, our strategy is really focused on development of extensions of our existing operations and our portfolio of brownfield opportunity. We characterize our growth in near-term, medium-term, and longer-term development options. On the near-term side, the initial target of 200 million pounds per year of copper from our leach initiative has essentially been met. And now we're focusing on sustaining it and scaling it further. On prior calls, we discussed our initiatives to retain more heat in the stockpiles. And those activities are continuing. A big driver of the success in the last several months has been on our Leach Everywhere work, where we're applying solution to areas of the stockpile which have not previously been leached. We're also conducting targeted drilling to inject solution to areas within the stockpile where solution may have been blocked over time. And our data and modeling can now provide information that targets specific areas of opportunity. And we're gearing up to do this more at scale. We now believe we can scale these activities and double the incremental copper to 400 million pounds per annum over time. This is just from applying our operating practices at a larger scale without relying on new technologies. We're also continuing our work on the new technologies front. And that's going to give us the opportunity with success to reach our ultimate goal of 800 million pounds per annum from this initiative over the next three to five years. Remind everybody we have 40 billion pounds of copper in our stockpiles that's already been mined. This is not in our reserves. And it's an opportunity for us to get recovery from this copper that previously was thought to be waste material. This initiative has the best economics of anything in our portfolio given its low capital intensity and low incremental operating costs. And we're pursuing it very aggressively. Our productivities in the U.S., which I mentioned earlier, are focused on rebuilding the experience of our workforce. We've had a large number of new hires in recent years. And we need to rebuild our skills and experience, enhancing our practices to achieve better equipment performance and reliability, and taking advantage of new technologies and automation to restore and improve on productivity metrics that weakened during the pandemic. By increasing our productivity in the U.S., we have the opportunity to add an additional 200 million pounds per year from our existing assets with limited capital investment. We're also continuing our work on a potential expansion of the Baghdad mine in Northwest Arizona. We're completing a feasibility study. And we're taking some steps now to enhance optionality for the future, including making some investments in autonomous haulage in our mining operations at Baghdad. And we're advancing investments in our tailing infrastructure for the future. We are setting up Baghdad expansion project as an option for the future. The timing of it will depend on market conditions. We're looking at the increased capital cost requirements for projects and consider that. We're also looking at the availability of labor. And we'll make all those reviews before finalizing our decision on the timing of this project. But it's a very large resource for us. We've got significant reserves spanning over 80 years there and a good opportunity for expansion in the future at the right time. We also have a major opportunity for expansion at El Abra mine in Chile. This is a very large resource that could support a concentrator on the size of the concentrator we added at Cerro Verde several years ago. We're retesting the economics to update project capital costs in light of the recent capital cost experience of other large projects. And in parallel, we're planning investments in water infrastructure to support the current operation and provide optionality for the future. Again, this is about options for expansion at the right time. And we've got the portfolio with a lot of option value within the Freeport portfolio. Our Kucing Liar development in Grasberg is proceeding on schedule. We expect to commence production by 2030. The huge ore body ramping up to 550 million pounds of copper and 560,000 ounces of gold in the next decade. We're also conducting some additional exploration in the Grasberg district where we have identified some potential below our deep MLZ [Ph] ore body. We're continuing to advance discussions in Indonesia for extension beyond 2041. That would open the door for continuation of large scale mining and potential additional development options in one of the world's largest and highest grade copper and gold mining districts. Longer-term, we're focused on a major opportunity that we have in the U.S. at the Safford Lone Star District. We've identified a significant resource there. And we continue to see the Safford District with the potential to add another cornerstone asset of scale in the U.S. We're in an outstanding position as we look at our large resource and reserve position and the experience of our team to continue our leadership role in supplying copper to a world with growing requirements. We're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach. And we're going to be focused on executing projects so we can create value for shareholders. Slide seven provides our three year outlook for sales volumes. You'll see this is largely unchanged from our prior forecast. We've increased our 2023 copper sales volumes by about 40 million pounds. And that reflects the updated shipping schedules expected in Indonesia. There's no material changes in guidance for 2024 or 2025. We do believe we have some upside to these numbers with continued success in our leach efforts and our work on productivity enhancements in the U.S. We're turning to our regional data on slide eight. We show our projected 2023 volumes and unit net cash costs by region. The Americas, including North America and South America, comprise about 63% of our 2023 copper sales and all of our molybdenum sales. Indonesia represents 37% of our copper sales and all of our gold sales. The Americas volumes are similar to a prior forecast. And our sales estimates from Indonesia have been increased to reflect the shipping schedules that I mentioned earlier. On a consolidated basis, our unit net cash costs for the year are forecast at $1.63 per pound. It's slightly above the prior forecast of $1.55, $0.07 of that relates to export duties, which remain under discussion with the Indonesian government. We've also incorporated some higher costs for energy compared with the prior forecast. And after moderating in the first half of the year, we're seeing energy costs, particularly for diesel fuel, rising. We're continuing to work to enhance productivity to mitigate the cost increases we've experienced since 2022, really across the board for labor, our contract maintenance services, equipment component costs, and a series of input costs that have risen. And we're working hard to try to mitigate those through effective cost management and productivity enhancements. Turning to cash flows on slide nine, we model our results for EBITDA and cash flow for 2024 and 2025 showing a price range of four to five dollar copper. We've got sensitivities on the page so you can use for looking at the changes based on changes in input costs or copper prices. The annual EBITDA would range under these scenarios from nearly ten billion dollars per annum at four dollar copper to fourteen billion dollars at five dollar copper and operating cash flows would range from seven to ten billion dollars under these assumptions. With long live reserves and large scale production, we're well positioned to benefit from future metals intensive growth and that will provide opportunities for organic investments and cash returns under our performance based payout framework. On slide 10, we show our current forecast for capital expenditures for 2023 and 2024. 3.2 billion total for 2023 is similar to our prior estimate and our capital for 2024 is 3.9 billion compared with the prior estimate of 3.8 billion. For 2024, we've added some discretionary capital to commence a new project in Indonesia to transition our energy source from coal to clean air LNG over the next three to four years and we expect to start that project next year. The discretionary projects total a little less than $2 billion over 2023 and 2024. This category reflects the capital investments we're making in new projects that under our financial policy are funded with the 50% of available cash that's not distributed. We've got some details on those projects in the reference materials. Slide 11, we've included some updated pictures of the smelter project in Indonesia. This is a major undertaking. It's being executed very efficiently. We're making steady progress toward completion. For the Greenfield smelter, we're now 84% complete on construction and we expect to begin commissioning the project by the middle of next year and ramping up to full production by the end of the year. We're also nearing completion of an expansion project that we're doing with our partner to expand the existing smelter in Indonesia. We expect construction to be completed by the end of this year in 2023. We're really pleased with the strong execution of our internal project team and our outside contractor to contain costs and meet schedules in a very complex environment for major project development. On slide 12, I just wanted to update you on some climate initiatives. We published an updated climate report during the third quarter, which is available on our website. But I mentioned in Indonesia we're advancing plans to develop, to transition our coal to LNG. We have plans to develop a 265 megawatt gas-fired combined cycle facility and that would replace the coal units that were developed there over 25 years ago. The project has a cost of roughly $1 billion and the economics, as we looked at it, would eliminate the cost to refurbish and expand the existing coal units over time. The incremental economic cost of this project is roughly $400 million. Importantly, the transition would reduce significantly PT-FI's greenhouse gas emissions. And together with other initiatives PT-FI has undertaken, the total reduction would be on the order of 60% compared to the 2018 baseline. It's a very exciting project for us looking forward. We're also very pleased to report that we have a new power purchase agreement in Peru at Cerro Verde that will allow Cerro Verde the benefit of 100% of its power from renewable sources in 2026. And finally, on slide 13, we wanted to reiterate the financial policy priorities centered on a strong balance sheet, cash returns to shareholders, and investments in value-enhancing growth projects. The balance sheet is strong. We've got strong credit metrics, significant flexibility within our debt targets to execute on our projects. At the same time, we've distributed over $3.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases, and we have an attractive future long-term portfolio that will enable us to continue to build long-term value for shareholders. We've got to continue to focus on the current situation, though, and we're going to continue to monitor current market conditions. We'll carefully manage the timing of our projects to ensure our financial flexibility remains strong. Our team is really experienced in navigating challenging conditions while maintaining a focus on pursuing long-term value in the business and executing our plans responsibly, safely, and efficiently. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we appreciate all your attention and interest, and we'll now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead. Alex Hacking : Yes, morning, Richard and Kathleen. I wanted to ask a couple of questions on U.S. operations. Could you maybe discuss the cost performance there? That seems like it's a little bit higher than guidance and how you see that going forward. And then secondly, just on production, just so I understand, production this is about 340 million pounds. Does that include the incremental 46 million pounds from the new leaching? Is that all in the U.S.? And I guess if so, that sort of implies that production without those pounds would be below 300 versus like 370 million last year. So, maybe just some comments around that and how you see the leaching, impacting the production profile there going forward. Thanks. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, Alex. I mean, your question is right in terms of the performance in the U.S. of the base business. We're continuing to experience some challenges on productivity. We've got, we've been hiring people. We've got a lot of new people in our workforce. And so we're very focused on improving the productivity in the U.S. We're focused on maintenance. We've had some challenges with premature failures and some maintenance challenges that we're getting caught up on. We've also had a lot of increased costs related to component parts. We've had some increases in the cost of labor, particularly contract labor. You've probably seen all the activity in Arizona outside of copper with a lot of investment in various industries. It's a very competitive market. So the cost rises in North America have been higher than what we've experienced elsewhere. Of course, we've also had the benefit in international locations of the stronger dollar, which offset some of the labor cost impact. So you see that more in the U.S. But you're right that without the leach pounds, the incremental leach pounds that we accomplished year-to-date, we would have had lower production. And what we need to do is really get both of those flywheels going at the same time because the more we place, and we've been missing some of our placements in terms of the mining rates and the placements on the leach piles, the more opportunity we have to get more out of it through these leach initiatives. So it's a big focus of Josh and our whole team to really work on getting productivity up. If you look at grades, we're in a period right now at Morenci where we've got low grades. And the hallmark of Freeport has been to manage costs very well, given the low grades we have. But we've got to work our way through that and get our flywheel moving again to get productivity up. In terms of the leach pounds and the impact on cost, what really needs to happen with the leach project to really start seeing the impact on unit cost is enough confidence to be able to increase our reserves? And that will allow us to essentially, in the financial results, see lower unit costs as we add reserves and we're spreading costs over a larger number of pounds that economy of scale will start to come through. So the more confidence we get in this, the more we're able to actually put these opportunities into reserves and have enough confidence to do that, that's when you'll start to see the impact on the net unit cash costs. But I don't know if that was a long answer, but did that answer your question? Alex Hacking : Yes, that was a great answer, Kathleen. I really appreciate all the color. Thanks so much and good luck with everything. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Christopher LaFemina : Hi, Richard. Hi Kathleen. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about El Abra, which has tremendous potential. You've talked about it for a long time. You could build a big mill project there. With the clarity now around Chilean mining taxes, I would assume that's helpful. And also, I'm not sure if you've looked into the recent double taxation treaty, which I think for U.S. companies makes Chile potentially a more attractive investment. So wondering first kind of how you're thinking about that now and what we can sort of expect if you do progress in this project in terms of timing, capital cost scale, and then maybe as importantly, your partner's ability to help fund whatever you develop there, because I assume it's going to be a capital intensive project. I'm not sure Codelco has the capital to contribute alongside you with this. So how should we think about that? And again, does that double taxation treaty between Chile and the U.S. affect the economics of this project to potentially drive an investment decision? Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, Chris. Both of those items that you mentioned, the recent clarity around taxation in Chile and the issue between the treaty between the U.S. and Chile are both helpful. Quite frankly, if that hadn't been resolved, the latter had not been resolved, that would have posed a big challenge for us in developing the project. But that's been resolved. And so now we're really turning to the economic side of the equation. And we've been watching what's been going on in Chile with other major projects. We did a lot of work on this project, on the El Abra project, and it has good economics, but we want to retest those economics with current capital costs. And that'll be something that we've already started working on, but that's something we really want to get our heads around is, does it make sense? What's the timing given rising capital costs? I mean, you've seen really significant cost blowouts in Chile in recent time. And we want to make sure that we can deploy capital effectively, efficiently in this market. And as Richard was talking about, the copper price today doesn't really support new investment. And so, of significance. And so our focus really has been in this kind of environment on what we can do to be less capital intensive while continuing to advance our options and create optionality in the portfolio. Our plans in Chile currently are to invest in some water infrastructure, desalinization project that would allow us to extend the life of the current operation, and then that would give us optionality for the bigger expansion. And so what we're really doing now is trying to advance these things so we have optionality, but we're not wanting to commit to major, major, multi-billion dollar projects in the current environment. We all see this looming deficit coming, but the current price is just don't support big new investments like this at the current time. We know that will change over time and we want to be prepared at the right time to bring this project on. Permitting takes quite a while and Chile is on trying to streamline permitting. We're encouraged by that. In terms of the Codelco question on financing, they're very positive about the project and they've indicated to us support for it at the right time and we'll figure out financing this at the right time when we go forward. But right now we don't have to make that decision. Christopher LaFemina : That is very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Michael Dudas : Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. Kathleen Quirk : Good morning, Mike. Michael Dudas : I'm going to be following up on some of the other questions. I get the sense that access to labor, contracting, rising interest rates, raising the hurdle rates for capital investment, do you think that this has pushed out whatever expectations of maybe Freeport\u2019s longer-term or medium term investments or the industry's investments given these dynamics, especially the copper price, which as you indicated, I think everybody agrees, wouldn't support this type of investment? Kathleen Quirk : Richard, do you want to take that one? Richard Adkerson : Sure. I think there's no question about it, Mike. As I said, our revenues and those of other copper producers are correlated to prices. As I talk with a lot of people, and I was just at LME last week, I was with a group of senators and congressmen in Washington the night before last. With the new cost structure, people's historical views of copper prices need to be adjusted. I mean, at one point, $3.50 or $4.00 copper price was considered to be a very strong price, but with the effects of inflation, it's not the same. And so you have to look at both of those together. And then the thing that's really striking to us, and you can see this in a number of other projects by companies around the world, is that capital costs inflation is significant and persistent. You can see from our own numbers, particularly when diesel costs dropped earlier, they've ticked up again some. But I thought we had good performance with our operating cost measures. But then when you get into this issue of major projects, the capital costs are really significant. We really are motivated to invest because we have strong conviction about the future of copper prices, but at the same time, history has taught us that it's best to be prudent in the way we commit capital. You might could incrementally improve returns if you were more aggressive near term, but we retain all these projects. We don't lose the opportunity, but we, and I believe others, are going to be prudent until they see how this current situation around the world with China and inflation and central banks activities, and now we've got the increasingly complication of geopolitical events going on. And that's why I made my comment at the outset that this does nothing but bolster the future supply deficit that the industry is facing. So it's a two-edged sword. We'd like to go forward, but we've concluded it's best to be prudent. And with the industry, I believe others will as well, and that just means that supplies are going to be limited for the future, the time when copper demand will be growing. Michael Dudas : It sounds like discretion is the better part of valor. Thank you, Richard. Richard Adkerson : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Oris Waukadal [Ph] with Scotia Bank. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. Kathleen Quirk : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : I'm wondering if you can share any expected timeline for reaching any kind of conclusion in Indonesia with respect to the new export royalty rates and potentially the life extension there beyond 41. Kathleen Quirk : Well, the issue on the duty, you're talking about the duty, the situation there is that, as you're aware, our IUPK says that we're not subject to duties once the smelter gets over 50%. And the government issued some new regulations earlier this year, and this not just applies to Freeport, but all exporters for copper that are required to have smelters that are required to pay a 7.5% duty. And it's a sliding scale depending on how much progress you've made. We have raised the issue with the government, and they are reviewing the issue. They're also reviewing our progress of the smelter, and we're going to continue to work cooperatively with them. I want to just remind everyone that there's alignment of interest to a large degree there because the Indonesian government state-owned company owns 51% of PT-FI, and also PT-FI pays taxes. So the impact to the government of these export duties is also a significant item. So we've got support from our partner there to help us work through this issue with the government, and we're going to continue to -- I don't have a definitive timeline, but we're continuing to engage in discussions to address this. The extension discussions are also continuing. Our partner, MIND ID, is also very supportive of extending the operation. One of the really significant benefits that we've had in the new structure since 2018 where the government owns 51% is there is a better understanding of the time it takes to develop new resources or extend the resources. And so I think all the parties are aligned in that it makes sense to continue this operation beyond 2041. We made a lot of progress in developing a framework with the government on what the terms of that extension would be. A big catalyst for us is getting the smelter advanced and completed, and that, I think, would be a good catalyst for us to be able to continue to extend those operations out for the life of this resource. But conversations are ongoing. Indonesia is in an election cycle now, and so there are other things going on in the government. The government has a lot of priorities that they're balancing. But in terms of the want to and will of getting this extended to be able to continue the benefits that are very significant to the government of Indonesia and the people of Papua, there is good support for doing this. And we're working very hard to try to get it done as soon as possible, but the timeline is not under our control. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carlos de Alba with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Carlos de Alba : Yes, good morning, Kathleen and Richard. So the question I have is really on the discussion on the Indonesian funding, the Indonesian projects funding. Just to revisit, the smelter is now being paid by proceeds from the PT-FI senior notes and the revolving credit line. I just wanted to check if that is something that will continue as it is right now, and what about the funding for the other CapEx projects, KL, and other expansion of the Crusher and the new SAG mill there. Is that going to also be paid by these senior nodes and the internal cash regeneration? Or do you expect your non-controlling partners to contribute cash for those projects? And then maybe associated with this is how should we think about the dividends paid to non-controlling interest going forward? Kathleen Quirk : With respect to your question on the first topic, the Smelter project is being debt financed. And so we raised $3 billion in financing last year in long-term bond financing at the PT-FI level. So the economics of that, even though it's consolidated on FCX's financial statements, the economics essentially are borne by PT-FI shareholders. And we have a revolving credit facility as well to supplement that. So the Smelter, and that's why we look at it separately, it doesn't impact the cash flow we have at the FCX level that's available for distribution because it's being funded through these proceeds. With respect to other capital projects at PT-FI, those are funded internally at the PT-FI level. So when we look at the projects we're doing to complete the new SAG mill, when we look at the copper cleaner project, all of the capital projects at PT-FI, those are funded with that subsidiary's internally generated cash flows, which is very significant. And so, yes, as you increase capital there, it does reduce the dividends that come out of PT-FI. But these are really good projects that PT-FI has the ability to fund with its cash flows and distribute substantial amounts to its shareholders. In terms of the dividends there, that's really a function of what the performance of the business is. We have a policy, a dividend policy at the PT-FI level where all of the available cash flow is distributed to shareholders and FCX gets 49% of that and MIND ID gets 51%. But that's the policy that we're following and expect to continue to follow. Carlos de Alba : All right. Thank you, Kathleen. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Bill Peterson : Yes. Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. And nice job on execution given all the challenges out there. My first question is actually a bigger picture question tying to an earlier question. So, if you take into account this broader inflationary environment, increased project financing cost, I guess where does pricing need to be and how sustained does that need to be for Freeport and maybe even industry if you want to comment on that, but specifically for Freeport to support projects such as Baghdad expansion or El-Abra as examples? Kathleen Quirk : Well, we're updating our capital costs now for El-Abra. Previously when we ran the economics several years ago, it's been a few years ago before the pandemic when we outlined the potential for the project, today's price would have worked fine. It would have been a good return. But there were other factors that led us to put the project on hold. In today's world, we need to retest those economics. I mean, just look at the recent project in Chile of how much that cost increased and it's a huge, multi-billion dollar impact. And that impacts our thinking and that impacts economics. So, we don\u2019t think we know the economics we ran previously don't apply currently. And so, we've been doing some work, we've been doing some additional work on the resource and we've got some positive things that have developed since then that will help the economics, but this capital cost inflation is a real issue and it's something that we need to keep in mind. On the Baghdad project, this is a project that with El-Abra, these are new reserves. So with El-Abra, it would allow us to produce reserves currently in the ground where we don't currently have infrastructure that can produce those reserves. At El-Abra, I mean at Baghdad, it's a different analysis. At Baghdad, we can produce those reserves over 80 years or we can double our processing capacity and produce those reserves over a shorter period of time. And so you have to look at the capital cost and how that interplays with it being an acceleration of production rather than new production. So we're looking, we're completing the feasibility study. The costs we believe are going to come in higher than what we expected them to and so that will have an impact on us. The other thing that will have an impact on our decision will be the availability of labor and whether we can execute that project efficiently. We're doing some things now to create options. We got the autonomous plans to put in autonomous haulage at Baghdad. It's our first mine in the U.S. that will do that and that's exciting for us and that creates options for us in the future. And we're doing some work, some early works to give us options there. But the numbers don't work. I think if you ask people in the industry, what it takes, people are going to tell you it's over $4 to develop new projects. But every project is different and that's why when we look at this leach opportunity, the potential to add 800 million pounds of copper with very low capital costs is very compelling and so we're going to be looking for opportunities in the near term during this uncertainty to expand our production but it's going to be through innovation, automation rather than high capital intensity. And we'll continue to test that and that will continue to evolve but that's the current thinking is that right now the copper price is not enough to support a major investment in a big expansion or a greenfield project. Bill Peterson : Well understood and thanks for that color. I guess just on the second question on working capital, so how should we think about the cadence of working capital through the balance of the year given exports have now resumed in Indonesia? Are you still expecting a slight use for the year? Kathleen Quirk : Yes, it's a use but we expect some of that will turn in the fourth quarter. Some of what we had in terms of the inventories and receivables will turn but we are expecting a use for the year. Bill Peterson : Okay, terrific. Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Let me just add one quick. Hang on, let me just add one quick comment to support what Kathleen is saying. People, and I understand it if you're doing overall industry analysis, you're looking for what is the incentive price that triggers new production but Kathleen made the point that each project is different and then each company's situation is different. One of the strong things about our business is that because of our production levels, our resource base, our ability to add to production with things like leaching but beyond that more with being more efficient with technology working our assets harder and so forth. We don't face the same pressures from reinvestment risk that some other companies face but also other commodities face because of shorter reserve lives. And that's one thing I like so much about our business is that it gives us that flexibility to not have to take risks, not have to press things during uncertain economic times but as I mentioned earlier, to be just more prudent about how we run our business. It's a great strength of our industry to a certain degree, but of Freeport as a company, because of our strong production base and long-lived [Ph] properties and the ability to maximize production out of our existing properties by doing things smarter and using technology and working assets harder. Bill Peterson : Thank you, Richard. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Alex Terentiew with Stifel. Please go ahead. Alex Terentiew : Hey, good afternoon or morning, everybody. Just two quick questions for me. First, I just wanted to follow up some of the comments here on Indonesia with the smelter export duty. Any changes, latest changes in the regulations that would change your view on whether you expect the export duty to go to zero once the smelter is built? And then the second question, just circling back on the leach expansion, 800 million pounds over, if you can get there in three to five years, I mean, that's a pretty impressive number. I just wanted to get some more details from you if I could, just on the cost for that. I mean, the U.S. operations have been running around, call it, 270 a pound or so. Is that a fair cost for us as well? Or, I mean, would the operating cost be higher but much lower capital costs? Just trying to get a sense of what the upside is for that sort of potential. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. On the duty issue, the duties are paid on concentrate exports. So, once we get the smelter done and ramped up, we will have no more exports of concentrates. We'll be, we'll be producing copper cathode and gold, the actual metals. So the export duty only applies to this intermediate, step of concentrates. So, there hasn't been anything in terms of we're still working with the government. Right now, the export license is through May. And so, we've still got to work with the government to work through this issue beyond May of having a ramp up period. We'll still be shipping some concentrates, exporting some concentrates during the ramp up. But we're going to work cooperatively with the government to make sure that those that continuity continues. With respect to the leach pounds, not every application is the same. But on average, we expect these leach pounds to come in at roughly a dollar per pound. And so, that is, that's why we're so excited. Most of this is in our U.S. business. And so, it'll bring down, if we're successful, and we're able to put this into our reserves, it'll bring down our average cost in the U.S. over time. And I'll just ask, Corey Stevens on the line, and he and his team are leading this initiative. And just wanted to ask Corey if there's anything that we didn't cover on leaching that you want to make points of that hasn't been discussed so far. Corey Stevens : Yes, Kathleen. I guess the one thing I would just add or maybe just emphasize is some of the, the momentum that's been able to build around this effort, really around these executable known technologies has been significant. And so, we've been building, quarter-over-quarter. And now we've got line of sight to the 200 million. But really, the portfolio gives us sustainability going forward into the future and builds this foundation that, I can see it significantly building from there. And then you've got a whole other portfolio of innovation work, whether it's additives or alternate flow sheets or, really leveraging temperature at that next level that the team is really excited about. So super focused on disciplined execution, that the team is super energized, and looking forward to the future. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. And so there's a lot of value in this opportunity. And we see it, we can feel it. And we're pressing forward. But as we talked about earlier, we've got to get that going, at the same time we get our productivity, our key performance indicators improved in the U.S. And that's a big focus as well. So those two things we believe will generate a lot of value in our U.S. business and it's not capital intensive. So that's really our primary focus right now is on getting those two things going at the same time. And we've made great progress on the leach front. We're making progress on the productivity initiative front, but we've got more work to do there. Alex Terentiew : Yes, those are impressive numbers on the production and the cost front. So best of luck to you and your team. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks Alex. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Brian MacArthur : Good morning, Richard and Kathleen. My question just goes back to the export duty. The 147 million you incurred this quarter, two things, I assume that going retroactive back to March 29th when it technically was scaled down. So you're sort of paying two quarters. And the second thing is the text talks about incurring it. Have you actually paid it on a cash basis or is it just a payable as you kind of sign work through all this? Kathleen Quirk : It was a go forward duty. So it wasn't based on retroactive. So go forward duty. And 7.5% of the exports values were assessed. Some of it's been paid, some of it's not been paid. And there's a process in Indonesia where just like any other process where you have disputed amounts or amounts that you're objecting to, you can go through a process and pay it, but you pay it with that advisory that it remains disputed. But for financial accounting purposes, given just the uncertainty of how it would all play out, we have accrued those costs. And so we've expensed those as we go. If it gets resolved, that'll get favorably, it'll get reversed. But at this point, we're accruing for these costs pending the ultimate outcome. Brian MacArthur : Great, thanks. Just to be clear, because last quarter, yes, I'll follow up with David. Because just last quarter, the export duties were zero on the cost per pound. So that's why I was just trying to figure out exactly how this is working. Yes. I can follow up with David. Richard Adkerson : Just remember, Brian, we weren\u2019t exporting for a fairly substantial period of time there. We had this administrative delay for even having any exports. And that's when our inventory built up so much, we were able to sell it down. But we went for, what was it, Kathleen, about six weeks without having any exports. And so the duty is paid when it\u2019s export. Kathleen Quirk : Yes, the new regulation didn't come out to June, July time frame. And so the second quarter, we didn't have duties. It was this June 10th date that triggered some new regulations. So you're right that we didn't have duties in the second quarter. So the duties that you're seeing in the third quarter relate to the third quarter shipments. Brian MacArthur : Great. Thanks very much. That's very clear. And thank you, Richard. That's very helpful as well. Richard Adkerson : Thank you. Operator : With that, we'll turn the call over to management for any closing remarks. Kathleen Quirk : Well, thanks everyone for your participation. And we're available if anybody has any questions or comments. And just talk to David. And we'll look forward to continuing to report to you on our progress. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathleen Quirk, President. Please go ahead, ma'am. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Freeport-McMoRan conference call. Earlier this morning, we reported our fourth quarter and full year 2023 operating and financial results. And a copy of today's press release and supplemental schedules and slides are available on our Web site at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.  Before we begin our comments, we\u2019d like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include non-GAAP measures and forward-looking statements and that actual results may differ materially. I would like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings. Also on the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, our Chairman and CEO; Maree Robertson, our Chief Financial Officer; Josh Olmsted, our COO of Americas; Mark Johnson, Operating Officer for Indonesia; Mike Kendrick, who runs our molybdenum business; and Steve Higgins, our Chief Administrative Officer. We'll start the call with some opening comments from Richard and then we will go through the slide presentation materials and then open up the call for your questions.  So I'll turn it over to Richard. Richard, go ahead. Richard Adkerson : Okay. Good morning, everyone. As you can see, our first quarter was really a sound quarter and outstanding in several respects in terms of our operations. It was really led by PT-FI during the whole year of 2023. We began our ramp up in 2019 of the underground and now we are fully operationally, and the team has been setting records consistently out there and have just outperformed for the full year and faced some really challenges, which is just part of that business. But I'm very proud of our PT-FI team at job site in Jakarta. We are making great progress and fulfilling our 2018 commitment to the government to invest in downstreaming and the copper concentrate business. In December, I was there for the inauguration of the expansion of the older smelter, PT Smelting with President Joko Widodo and that was a good event. And then with our new smelter at Manyar in Eastern Java, we reached an important 90% milestone at the end of the year and we're progressing for physical completion of the smelter and ramping it up on schedule in 2024. A couple of words about the markets. It continues to be the micro versus macro story. Notably, in 2023, the macro factors strengthened notably. 2023 had long been forecasted to be a year of surplus because of new mines coming on stream, but it ended up being a small deficit. And at the same time, there was stronger than expected demand for copper in the United States and in China despite all the issues with China's property business other sectors created a notable growth for copper in China. Then there were the supply shortfalls throughout the industry for some significant mines and these for range of factors that are kind of common to our business. The copper business, mining business is a tough business, but it was political issues in some countries, community issues and then operating issues. As a result of all that, inventories of copper around the world are at historically low levels and the inventory levels are really inconsistent with the current copper price. The copper price clearly being driven by macroeconomic factors. The currency, the strong US dollar, carryover effects of inflations, government fiscal policies, and there are concerns about economies in China and Europe. But if the macro outlook -- and I'll just say when the macro outlook improves, watch out for the copper price. Looking ahead, the world's going to need significantly more copper in the future for a variety of factors. The world's just becoming increasingly electrified and that's what copper is used for. And it's at a time when the industry is simply not investing to grow production that the outlook indicates that will be required for economic, operational and resource nationalism, a series of factors, but the facts are there's an outlook for strong demand and supply challenges. That's why I'm so personally confident about where Freeport is positioned and pleased with it. We have high volume existing production that's sustainable. We have large sustainable reserves and resources. We have growth opportunities that we will pursue prudently from this really exciting leaching initiative that Kathleen will be talking about and from brownfield expansions of our existing orebodies. Before turning over to Kathleen, I just want to send a note of condolences to our friends at Rio Tinto. You may have seen the news, but they had a plane to go down in Canada heading to their diamond operations there. Rio has been a special part of Freeport's history. Of course, they were our partners for many years at Grasberg. I have worked with six, seven, eight CEOs over my career. Some of my closest colleagues have been with that company. And the toughest part of being a CEO is to lose people and I'm just so sad to hear this news and the whole Freeport family's heart goes out to our friends at Rio.  With that Kathleen, I will turn over to you. Kathleen Quirk : Okay. Thank you, Richard. And I will be covering the presentation materials starting with Slide 3, our achievements for 2023 are summarized here. Our sharp focus on executing our plans in an effective, safe and responsible manner, managing the controllable drivers and navigating challenges successfully, all translated into solid operating results over the year. A big highlight for the year was the outstanding progress in Indonesia where we grew production levels for the fourth year in a row. We posted several new operating records and we continue to enhance values for this large scale, low cost and long life resource. We were also successful in reaching several milestones during the year, including reaching our target run rate for incremental leach production in the Americas, enhancing optionality in the Americas for our brownfield growth projects and reaching our targeted 90% completion milestone for the Indonesian smelter project by the end of 2023. As a leader in the industry, we were one of the first companies to have all of our operating sites certified under the copper and molybdenum marks, and this demonstrates our performance and commitment to responsible mining practices. We ended the year 2023 in a strong financial position, a positive outlook and as we work together to enhance long term value for shareholders. On Slide 4, we summarize the key results for 2023 compared with historical levels. After growing our volumes from 2020 to 2021 and 2022, we were able to same production of copper in 2023 despite a challenging environment for copper supplies Richard discussed, and we reported another year of growth in gold production. Our unit net cash costs for 2023 were above the 2022 level as expected but they came in very close to our original guidance for the year. We are continuing to actively manage cost and profitability initiatives to address cost inflation, and we will be working on that as we go forward. For the year 2023, we generate strong EBITDA of $8.8 billion and operating cash flows of over $5 billion. We are continuing to carefully manage not only our operating costs but also capital expenditures with a priority on spending on projects to sustain production, improve efficiencies and enhance optionality for future development options with attractive rates of return. During 2023, we returned $860 million to shareholders, bringing the total shareholder returns to $3.8 billion since we implemented our performance based payout framework in 2021. We ended the year with net debt of approximately $800 million and that excludes the smelter related debt, which is being financed separately. I'm going to move to Slide 5 and talk about the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, our sales were 3% above our estimates going into the quarter. Our gold production was also very strong. But our shipments of gold in the fourth quarter was slightly below the previous estimates and that reflected timing in these shipments when we made in the first quarter. Unit net cash costs averaged $1.52 per pound in the fourth quarter that was better than our guidance of $1.58 per pound and slightly below the year ago period. Notably, unit net cost, cash costs in Indonesia were zero in the fourth quarter, zero cents per pound, meaning our gold credits completely offset the production cost for copper. Average copper realizations in the fourth quarter were $3.81 per pound and we generated $2.3 billion in EBITDA and operating cash flows of $1.3 billion. We go around the world and talk a little bit about our various operations in the fourth quarter. In the US, we made progress in increasing our mining rates, that's been a big focus during the quarter with a 9% increase over the year ago quarter. We have a continued focus on improving our asset efficiencies and workforce experience levels. These are important initiatives as we seek to increase productivities to combat lower ore grades. Our innovative leach initiatives met expectations and also helped to mitigate the impact of lower ore grades in the US. Labor market conditions in the US continue to be tight. We're taking steps to expand housing options in our remote locations for recruiting and retention, and we're also continuing to pursue technology solutions to enhance productivity. Conversion of the bad debt truck fleet to fully autonomous is advancing and we're targeting to commence the transition in the second half of next year. In South America, our ore milled was sustained above 400,000 metric tons per day and our ore stacking rates increased at El Abra. No recoveries at Cerro Verde in the fourth quarter of 2023 were below the year ago level because of the material types that we're mining in the fourth quarter. This is continuing for mining phases in early 2024 and we're working to optimize performance. As Richard discussed, the fourth quarter performance in Indonesia was exceptional. Underground ore mined averaged over 214,000 tons per day and that was 8% higher than the year ago period. Combined with strong grades and recoveries, our copper and gold production in the fourth quarter was over 20% higher than last year's fourth quarter. We completed the installation of a new SAG mill at PT-FI in December and that'll provide additional opportunities for us going forward. And the team is just doing outstanding work, sustaining and optimizing value from this large resource position. We thought it'd be good to look back in history of how the underground transition has gone, Slide 6 covers this. We show the history of the progression of the transition. As Richard mentioned, we stopped mining from the surface in the Grasberg open pit at the end of 2019 and transitioned to fully underground operations beginning in 2020. We have a long history in Indonesia, spanning over 56 years and a great track record for building value over many years for all stakeholders. We\u2019re extremely proud of the team's execution on this transition. We now have the world's largest underground mining complex and it\u2019s been developed in a modern efficient operation. The Grasberg is the world's second largest copper mine and one of the largest gold mines, even though gold is a byproduct. High grades of both copper and gold make it one of the lowest cost operations in the world as well. This took a lot of planning. We began planning for this underground area over 25 years ago and commenced development activities in 2004. And as you can see from the graph, the project is performing exceptionally well and generating strong margins and cash flows. As we look forward, we are continuing to make investments in this resource to enhance value and sustain long term performance. We are working on the extension of our operating rights beyond 2041 and increasingly confident about securing our long term rights, and that would extend lives of our resources and open a whole new set of opportunities for this district. Richard touched on the smelter progress and this is really important for us in terms of securing long term rights. We reached two important milestones on these initiatives in 2023. The projects include a new greenfield smelter in East Java and expansion of our nearby existing smelter, which was developed in the late 1990s. Richard mentioned we celebrated in December the completion of the expansion project with the Indonesian Government and our Japanese partner. And we also reached a really important milestone on progress of the greenfield project with completion progress achieving a target we set with the government of over 90% by the end of December. We posted a video this morning on our Web site that shows the Greenfield smelter project. You can see all the progress that's been made and you can see the sheer size and scale of this impressive facility, and I hope you will have a chance to look at it. Both projects have been executed very efficiently in the context of a challenging market for major project development. The internal team that we have working on this project together with our contractor have done an outstanding job containing costs and maintaining schedules. We are working to complete the construction by the end of May of 2024 and to start commissioning and to conduct the ramp-up period over the balance of 2024. This is a big deal for us. It's not very frequent that you see new smelters starting up, and we have done a lot of planning going into the start up process. Our teams are well prepared and really highly motivated to achieve a safe, efficient and timely start-up in 2024. Turning to the US and the Americas where we've got an important leach initiative ongoing. We achieved our targeted run rate where we were targeting approximately 200 million pounds of copper per year by the end of 2023. This is an exciting and innovative initiative involving new operating practices being applied to our traditional leach operations and really working to get more out of our massive stockpiles that contain material that has been placed in prior years. Remember as we talked about on prior calls, the cost of this, the incremental cost of production, is low from both an operating and capital perspective, because we're targeting material where the material has already been mined and we're largely using existing infrastructure to extract the new metal. The first phase of this initiative essentially involves four basic categories of actions. One, as we talked about previously, we commenced the process to install covers over the stockpiles to increase heat retention and drive higher recoveries. Two, we gained access to areas in the stockpiles that have not previously had the benefit of leach solution initiative, we call leach everywhere. Three, we started using drilling techniques to specifically target areas within the stockpile where solution was lacking. And importantly, the fourth area is developing more sophisticated models using data analytics to optimize the application of solutions to improve performance, and using this data as a valuable tool in guiding work in all the areas of initiatives in this important program. As we look at where the impacts came from, you can see most of the incremental production was from our Morenci mine. That mine has a very long history of leaching operations. We have a massive set of stockpiles there and a very large opportunity set at Morenci. As we go to Phase 2 of the project where we are working to essentially double the initial target from 200 million pounds to 400 million pounds, we really are looking at just scaling these practices further. And by continuing to scale the operating practices, we think we can double the initial target over the next two to three years. And as we continue to work to sustain the production, we can add to our reserve position, and that's a real focus of ours to capitalize the progress into long term reserve additions. The first and second phase of this initiatives is really operationally driven using existing technologies. The third phase, which is also very exciting, is really the work that we and others are doing to advance the leaching process using different additives and different techniques, and this is more of an R&D effort but it's being advanced. We're commencing a large scale testing activity to evaluate the response to new additives. And we're also evaluating opportunities to get more heat retention in our stockpiles, and heat really is an enabler of more copper production and higher recoveries. In aggregate, these initiatives have the potential to reach 800 million pounds per annum and that's equivalent to a large scale copper mine. And notably, it's got very low capital intensity and you have seen how much new copper mines cost. This is a very low capital intensity, low incremental operating costs and a low carbon footprint. The value potential here is very attractive, particularly for a company like Freeport to take advantage of given our large quantities of suitable materials that we previously mined. Richard touched on copper markets earlier and we have some information on Slide 9. Physical markets have continued to tighten, inventories have declined and demand is growing. Despite the weak sentiment over the last several quarters on the Chinese economy and property sector, the reality is that China's copper consumption was strong throughout 2023 and this reflected the intensity of copper used in energy infrastructure, renewables and electric vehicles. In the US, our customers continue to report solid demand for copper with growth in several sectors. At the same time, supply disruption increased meaningfully in recent months. In total, near term supplies of copper had been reduced by over 700,000 tons in a very short period of time. The market was previously expecting that 2024 would be a small surplus market and turning to deficit beginning in 2025 timeframe and continuing for some time. With the recent supply disruptions and continued demand growth, the deficit market has been advanced into 2024, setting up for tight market conditions in the near term. While the fundamentals have become significantly more positive, macro conditions tied to US dollar strength and sentiment about China have influenced copper price movements. Richard mentioned we believe the fundamentals of the market will lead to significantly higher copper prices in the future and that's supported by anticipated strong growth in demand associated with secular trends and the global economy's requirements for copper. Also, the realities of the cost and time frames required for new supply development is an important factor when we look at the fundamental outlook for copper. Turning to how Freeport is positioning to try to grow production in response to this market demand. On Slide 10, we really look at the sizable reserve position of copper and even larger resource position that Freeport has that supports a pipeline for future growth options. Within the portfolio, we look for opportunities to get more out of what we have through innovation and operating efficiencies. We look for investments and projects so we have large resource positions and where we have established track records and opportunities to leverage the existing infrastructure, our people and capabilities, all with the drive focused on increasing value. We categorized on Slide 10 our near term, medium term and longer term development options. And we have outlined identified projects totaling about 1.7 billion pounds of copper in the Americas. And we have also highlighted on the slide the ongoing development of the Kucing Liar project in Indonesia, which is expected to support long term production profiles in the Grasberg District. The opportunities that are shown on the slide in the two to three year category they center around scaling our leach initiatives and achieving incremental production from our operational improvement projects. Together the potential from these opportunities total 400 million pounds of incremental copper per annum and do not require significant investment or long lead times. We discussed earlier the leach projects but we're also dedicating significant resources to enhancing productivity and asset efficiencies, rebuilding the experience of our workforce given the large number of new hires in recent years and utilizing new technologies and automation to restore and improve on productivity metrics that weakened somewhat during the pandemic. As we indicated, we completed a feasibility study late in the year 2023 to evaluate a project to more than double the size of our Bagdad operation in Northwest Arizona. The reserves at Bagdad are -- span for decades and they support expansion of infrastructure at the site to bring value forward. The incremental capital costs to build a new concentrator and support infrastructure for significantly higher mining and milling rates is on the order of $3.5 billion. And an expanded operation would not only substantially increase copper production but would produce economies of scale and reduce unit costs. The project does not require major permitting and is relatively straightforward. But given the tight labor market conditions and general market factors, we're not making a decision right now on the timing of the project. We'll continue to evaluate the timing of when we would go forward, but we are taking steps now to enhance optionality for the future by making some investments in the autonomous haulage for our mining operations, making some investments in housing and also advancing investments in the tailings infrastructure that will put us in a position and we make the decision we could get the project online within a few years. In Chile, at El Abra, we've talked about this. Our resource is very large. We have a major opportunity to install a new concentrator on the order of magnitude size of the concentrator we added at Cerro Verde in 2015. We'll continue to work to retest the economics and updating our project capital costs in light of recent capital cost experience of other large projects. And in parallel, we're starting work in preparation for environmental impact statement that would give us the ability to advance the project and provide optionality for future development. We mentioned the Kucing Liar development project in the Grasberg District, which we've initiated development on. This is a multiyear development project and it's proceeding on schedule and we expect to commence production by 2030, ramping up to over 500 million pounds of copper and over 500,000 ounces of gold. We're also conducting additional exploration in the Grasberg District where we have identified potential. We've got a big potential below our Deep MLZ orebody, and we expect to have additional opportunities in the future at Grasberg. We have a major opportunity in the US at the Safford Lone Star District. We've identified a significant resource there. This year, we're going to work to complete metallurgical testing and mine planning, and start a pre-feasibility study to assess future development options there. We continue to see this district as one that has big potential and potentially being a cornerstone asset in the US adjacent to the Morenci operations. In Indonesia, we\u2019re focused on this extension of our rights beyond 2041 because that would open up substantial opportunity for reserve and resource expansion and a continuation of the large scale mining in one of the world's largest and highest grade copper and gold mine districts. We are in a really strong position to continue our leadership role in supplying copper to a world with growing requirements. But we are going to continue to be disciplined in our approach and focused on executing projects where we can create value for shareholders. We have a lot of history in developing big projects, we included a slide on Page 11 that you can take a look at. A key strength of our company is the ability to execute projects successfully. This does not come easy. It requires a focused hands-on approach. And we have got a business model of pairing internal resources with trusted contractors and that has served us well. We have listed several projects that we have led over the years and we have developed very complex projects around the world. We are going to continue to approach future projects with the same level of preparedness, rigor and a focus on execution. As we look at 2024, turning to Slide 12, we have got our focus areas listed here. And first and foremost, we remain committed to safe and reliable execution of our operating plans across the global business. It seems like a simple thing but this involves discipline and hard work day in and day out. We discussed our focus on enhancing performance in the US through our Leach initiatives and productivity. This is particularly important to mitigate low grades and to manage costs, which have experienced higher inflation in recent years. We are going to have another big year in Indonesia. A key priority for us is to complete the smelter and ramp-up safely and efficiently and to finalize an agreement for extension of our long term operating rights. We are also very focused on enhancing optionality, definition and the value of our embedded growth options. On Slide 13, as usual, we show a three year outlook for sales volumes of copper, gold and molybdenum. For 2024, the copper sales volumes are slightly reduced less than 2% below our prior estimate and are now expected to be similar to 2023 levels. The gold sales are 10% higher than our prior estimate and higher than they were in 2023, higher sales in Indonesia for the year of 2024 offset by slightly lower sales from the Americas. In 2025, our sales estimates are similar to the prior estimates and we have added 2026 estimates, which you can see are slightly above the 2025 levels. For 2024, we currently estimate our consolidated unit costs to approximate $1.60 per pound. We have got some details in the reference materials, I believe, on Page 30 that you can look at the composition of those costs, but $1.60 very similar to what we had in 2023. On Slide 14, we put together our projected volumes and cost projections and we model the results for our EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $4 to $5 copper. These models use the average of 2025 and 2026 and our current volume estimates and our cost estimates and holding gold flat at roughly current levels of $2,000 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $19 per pound. And you can see here on the charts that annual EBITDA in these periods would range from $10 billion per annum at $4 copper to over $14 billion per year at $5 copper and operating cash flows under these price scenarios would range from $7 billion to over $10 billion. And we've got sensitivities to the various commodities on the right hand side of the chart. We're really well positioned with long line preserves, large scale production. We not only have current exposure to copper but all of our future projects and growth opportunities are well positioned to benefit from future metals intensive growth, and this will give us the ability to generate returns on projects and enhance cash returns under our performance based payout framework. Turning to the capital expenditures, on Slide 15. We show our current forecast for 2024 and 2025, which also show where we ended up for 2023, which total of $3.1 billion and that was slightly lower than what we've guided to in October of $3.2 billion. And capital for 2024 is currently forecast to approximate $3.6 billion compared with the $3.9 billion previously. The 2025 estimates that are new here are currently estimated to total $3.8 billion that includes $1.2 billion in discretionary growth projects, which totaled $2.4 billion over the 2024 and 2025 years. This category reflects the capital investments we're making in new projects to generate returns that under our financial policy are funded with 50% of available cash that's not distributed. They're value enhancing projects that are detailed in the reference materials on Slide 33. We're going to continue to be very disciplined around capital expenditures, carefully managing those. You saw we adjusted the capital expenditures down for 2024. And as we go forward, we'll continue to look at opportunities to do things, to sustain our business and to do things on a low capital intensity basis. And finally, before we take your questions, we -- just on Slide 16, we reiterate our financial policies and those are prioritized, centered on a strong balance sheet, cash returns to shareholders, and investments in value enhancing growth projects. Balance sheet is solid. We've got strong credit metrics and a lot of flexibility within our debt targets to execute on our projects. You may have seen that Moody's upgraded our credit rating in December and that just demonstrates our strong financial profile. Indicated on the slide, we've distributed almost $4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases since the payout framework was implemented in the second half of 2021, and we have an attractive future long term portfolio that will enable us to continue to build value, long term value for shareholders. The global team, as we go forward, is really highly focused on our strategy of being foremost in copper. And we're driven to continue pursuing long term value in the business and executing our plans responsibly, safely and efficiently. And I want to thank everybody for their attention, and we'll now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Alex Hacking : Richard, I guess my question is around Bagdad and the technical study. Now I was a little surprised by how high the CapEx was $3.5 billion or incremental 100,000 tons, that\u2019s about $35,000 a ton. I mean, in your view, is that the new normal for a concentrate project or are there particular factors the fact that are raising the CapEx above historical levels? Kathleen Quirk : I think it is somewhat of a new normal for the cost of a concentrator and related mining infrastructure. When you're dividing on the cost per ton, you're looking at how many pounds of copper are going to come out of that concentrator. And our US mines are characterized by relatively low ore grades, and Bagdad has relatively low copper ore grades but also has molybdenum kicker. So molybdenum would add something like 10 million pounds of molybdenum with an expansion. So that will be another benefit. But really, what we need to do is focus on -- it does bring down our overall cost per pound. So that's a big plus for us. When you look at an investment in the US, it may be to develop a relatively low grade mine. But something important to point out is that we don't have the tax burden in the US that you have in the international location. So I think our projects in the US, while they're low grade, when you cut through all the economics and you look at the ability for us to execute the projects and look at the risk associated with them are different than looking at a project in a different location. So there's some pluses or minuses that go into the bottom line. But we started this work on Bagdad some time ago and we've updated all of the capital costs in line with where current capital costs are. And so I think a reality of the market is that the incentive price to develop new copper, even if it's brownfield, is much higher than it has been in the past. And that's another reason why we believe that the markets that they need these copper units are going to have to adjust to the incentive prices required to get these projects going because we don't want to front run the market. We want to be prepared, we want to be -- have options to go forward as soon as we can. But we don't want to be in a position where we're investing in making major capital commitments before the market prices are telling us already. Richard Adkerson : Alex, let me just add very briefly that Kathleen makes a really good point about these relative economics. No royalties in the US. US tax rate is much lower -- federal tax rates much lower than outside the US. We have a net operating loss carryforward. Community support is strong in the US and we have no minority interest there. So looking at global benchmarks needs to be adjusted for the site specific factors that we have in the US, and they're very positive. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Carlos De Alba : Question is on cost. I just want to see if you can provide a little bit more color. The guidance for the first quarter of net unit cash cost of $1.55 per pound, looked very, very good relative to consensus stations and our own estimate. However, for the full year, the guidance came at $1.60 and that is a little bit higher than the market -- than again, consensus and our model suggests. So what are you expecting, what the viability in this, were you surprised at the beginning of the year but then maybe throughout the rest of the quarters is increasing, what is driving that? And to what extent this number for the year is conservative? Kathleen Quirk : In terms of the first quarter, we do have some gold that was not shipped in the fourth quarter that will be shipped in the first quarter. And so the relative gold-to-copper ratio impacts the first quarter and makes that less than what we expect the average to be for the full year. I don't know what -- Carlos, what you had in there for export duties, but we're assuming in Indonesia that those are continuing. We are continuing to discuss with the government of Indonesia the applicability of those duties. And I think the more that we make progress on the smelter the better our case there is. But that\u2019s something we factored into the estimate but we are continuing to have that discussion. So if we are successful in reducing those duties that would be a benefit. Carlos De Alba : And just to clarify then Kathleen. The cash cost guidance for the year of $1.60 includes the duties in Indonesia, concentrate exports remain throughout the entire of the year, right, the full year? Kathleen Quirk : Our export -- it only applies to export volumes. And so as we go through the year, the exports will decline because we'll be ramping up the smelter. So our goal for 2024 is to get the full ramp up completed. And so that's not something that will continue long term the duties once we get the smelter up and running. But it will start to decline over the course of the second half as we ramp up and we produce more domestically. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher LaFemina with Jefferies. Christopher LaFemina : I wanted to ask about the kind of cost trends in North America, in particular, at Morenci. So I know that you're guiding to a slight increase in your site production delivery costs in 2024. And I assume that is a function of volumes being lower. But if we think about kind of where this business could be headed assuming that Morenci can kind of get back to where it was 12 or 18 months ago, and I'm not sure if that's a good assumption, but let's assume that to be the case. With the leaching ramp up, with the staffing and productivity improvements, with the new technologies and potentially even longer term with the Bagdad expansion. Where could that kind of site production and delivery cost number trend down to, could it get back to $2.50 or lower, or is $3 a pound sort of the new normal for that business? Kathleen Quirk : Well, we hope it's not the new normal, Chris. We're working hard. I mean one of the things that you've got to take into account here is we are in a low grade period in the US. I think the grades that we had in 2023 were the lowest that they had been in probably 10 years or so or more. So we are in a period and that's continued in '24 where we do have some low grades that we're going through. But that is why it's so important for us to bring on units with a lower incremental cost and the leach opportunity will help us there. And as we are able to get those pounds put into reserves longer term, not just what you're mining that year or getting that year but multiyear reserve additions for the leach that spreads the cost -- all the costs over more reserves. And so it does help us with driving the economies of scale and why it's so important. We're not in a position now to say where costs could go. There's been a number of other factors that have -- inflation factors and things like the cost of basic parts and materials and supplies has gone up from where it was just two or three years ago, but we are very focused on it. And all of these self help things for us have very high rates of return. There's not a lot of capital involved. It's focused resources. It's not an easy thing because it would have been done already, but it is an area we think we can make improvements. We can also focus, which we're doing now on the last couple of years, we've had to rely more on contractors because of the staffing issues. But as we get staffing set up and get more experience in the workforce, we can reduce our reliance on contractors, as you probably know, have gotten expensive, and Arizona is a very competitive market. So we're working on all those things within the things that we have within our control and are really going to be focused on trying to drive the cost down. We're also looking at Morenci specifically at different configurations. We're looking at whether it makes sense for us to be operating all of our equipment like we are today and looking at if we cut back some things would that be the cost and benefits to that because that could have volume impacts as well. But is that a better setup, a more efficient setup that will allow us to drive costs lower. So we've got some of those initiatives that are being reviewed right now on what the right setup is given how costs have risen. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Orest Wowkodaw : Given the capital costs involved and the timing of building new projects and the strength of your balance sheet. I'm just wondering whether M&A of producing assets is something that's on the radar, because it certainly seems like there could be some assets available out there, especially in jurisdictions you\u2019re not currently in? Richard Adkerson : Well, we're constantly monitoring the market and you can be confident that opportunities are available are presented to us and we consider them. The facts are we haven't found those attractive today. We have such great opportunities to create value totally for our shareholders by focusing on internal growth through the leach project, through the brownfield developments in the Americas, through the Kucing Liar project in Indonesia and now with expectation that we'll go beyond 2041, we're going to do additional exploration there to understand what the opportunities are. Success in any of those opportunities creates value where there's no value in our current share price. So it's all for the best of our shareholders and that makes it much more difficult for external opportunities to compete with them. And my experience has shown that small mines get smaller and big mines get bigger. So we really are, as I said in my opening comments, pleased about where Freeport is positioned for what we believe is going to be a great future for our company. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edward Goldsmith from Deutsche Bank. Edward Goldsmith : Two questions from my side. So firstly, can you give an update on the status of the negotiations over concentrate export extension post May? And secondly, can you outline the reductions to the 2024 CapEx? I think they were the discretionary and the other CapEx bucket level. Kathleen Quirk : On the first part of the question, our current export license in Indonesia goes to May of 2024. And we are continually having discussions with the government of Indonesia about the fact that while we will be substantially complete on construction activities by the end of May, which is -- was really important target for us and for them that just the ordinary course of a smelter start-up, it takes five or six months to get through. And so we're having those discussions, they understand the situation. And they're encouraging us to continue to meet our targets and that those discussions will continue [Technical Difficulty] that the alignment that we have with the 51% ownership of the state-owned company mined ID in PT-FI's operations is really important here. That, combined with tax revenues, et cetera, that the government gets from having consistent operations at PT-FI is we're both aligned in that to have exports continue. So the conversations have been constructive to date but we've got to continue to progress it. And have those -- continuing to have the discussions with the government and we're doing that on a regular basis. Richard Adkerson : And Kathleen, just let me add. They're not negotiations over this issue. The mine -- I mean I've spoken in recent months on at least three occasions directly with the President about it. He understands it, the Mines Minister who has the business background clearly understands it. It's just administrative procedurally they concluded not to grant that export rights beyond this date to see if we complete the smelter as we've committed to do it. But beyond that, it will be just be an administrative action to get it approved. Kathleen Quirk : On the second question with respect to capital expenditures. We always go through a process of looking for opportunities to push out capital if it's not required in the current year. And we went through a process between the last update on this one to really look hard at what we could efficiently spend this year and cut back on some things. Some of that\u2019s showing up in 2025. We'll do the same thing again because really what we want to do is deploy the capital as efficiently as we can and make sure we're sustaining the reliability of our operations, but also looking at -- we don't want to be doing too many things at one time. And so we always take a hard look at it. So we'll continue to do that as we go forward and manage the capital very carefully. But there wasn't really one big thing, there was a number of things that we did in looking at the prior estimate for 2024. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Michael Dudas : With regard to your proposed investments in the US, maybe even looking in Latin America, maybe if you can remind us on an internal rate of return, risk-adjusted rate return basis, what Freeport is looking for? Certainly, you mentioned US investments, you get benefits from royalty and tax issues. But just on a general basis, even when you're thinking about your assets in Indonesia. And then the follow-up on that, is the industry relative to a year ago today, is the industry ahead of the curve or behind the curve on meeting what the expected demand opportunities are in the market? Kathleen Quirk : On the first part of the question, with respect to how we evaluate projects and returns, we don't target one number. We look at what the specific project is, what the execution risk is, where it's located. And we run a range of commodity price assumptions around it to look at. What we're really focused on in deploying capital is investing and putting our infrastructure and investments in places where we can execute the plan and in places where we've got long term reserves, because anybody that tells you they can get the copper price right is wrong because it's going to move up and down. And so what we want to have is a situation where we've got a very long life reserve where you can make that capital investment upfront and realize cash flows over a long period of time and not have to get the price forecast for copper perfect in the first year or two. And so when we look at returns, we're looking at those projects that have leverage to future copper. And we look at something outside of the US, we may apply higher risk factors and we look to get higher rates of return than what we would want to have in something like the US where for reasons that Richard talked about, have somewhat of a lower risk profile for us. But it is not one scientific number it's a range of scenarios that we run around a project. And again, looking at the resource and the size of the investment and our ability to generate returns over a long period of time that would be consistent, not that it would go away -- it would fall off, something that could be earned over a long period of time, has a long tail, which a lot of our projects do. And Richard might have some perspectives on the second question. I think it's obvious that there haven't been new projects sanctioned in our industry for some time. And what's happened recently in recent years with the copper prices rallying and then falling off has just caused more delays, more cautiousness by developers in developing the project. So I would say, in my opinion, the situation has become more significant because the projects are taking longer, not shorter. And we talked about when we started on Grasberg Underground, we started planning -- started investing 20 years ago in it. I mean you really have -- these are long lead time projects and we really need to have started investments. And that's why we're really focused on what can we do, continue to plan for these long term projects. So what else can we do and what can we do to take advantage of technology that's available to us and what can we do to get more out of the resources we already have, but not everybody has that ability. And Richard, I don't know if you want to add any comments to that second part. Richard Adkerson : Well, I'll add a brief comment to the first part too, Kathleen. My early experience in my career was in the oil and gas industry. And early on, Dan [indiscernible] and I wrote a paper on oil price forecasting, which basically evidenced how wrong forecasts can be. And so we approach, as Kathleen described, all of our investment and business planning on a scenario basis, not trying to predict a particular price or range of price but to look at what impact investment decisions and operating decisions have on our overall portfolio. And we look to protect ourselves on a portfolio basis from downside risk and then structure investments to take advantage of what we have is confidence in the long term price. So it's not any kind of formal rate of return kind of criteria that you see in a lot of industries, which work elsewhere, and have the saying that figures don't lie but liars figure. And so we just really base these things, as I said, on scenario planning and portfolio impacts. The basic thesis, I believe, for the demand for copper is unchanged and continues to be supported. From the very start my work with ICMM where I was Chairman, two occasions, but more recently when all the issues about aspirational goals for carbon reductions were being considered in such promise. I've always said that there are a lot of unanswered questions and the movement towards these aspirational goals will not be consistent, but they'll have issues, complications and so forth and that's certainly what we're seeing. The future of copper is really influenced significantly by investments in carbon reduction and I think it's something the world absolutely has to do. And there are other factors related to global growth, connectivity, these data centers, some of that's being driven by artificial intelligence. Just everywhere you turn, the world is getting more electrified. And that's why I think the fundamental long term demand thesis for copper is just getting stronger and stronger. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James. Brian MacArthur : It goes back to what Alex was asking in Bagdad. So I just want to make sure as I look at these numbers, so the project capital is $3.5 billion. And I would have to think you get some in structure benefit there, so it's not a true greenfield. And then you talk about a $3.50 to $4 incentive copper prices, and I understand the benefits of new royalties and taxes. Does that sort of say that if you didn't have infrastructure, the capital costs would have been higher. And if you didn't have all these tax benefits, the incentive price would be an awful lot higher, i.e., if anybody else had to do a greenfield there, you'd probably need a incentive price well over $4 to make it work, i.e., those numbers include all the tax benefits and everything that you were talking about before, if I can ask the question that way. Kathleen Quirk : Brian, if somebody else has the same situation, greenfield and the grades we have, it would be a lot more, a lot more expensive. Richard Adkerson : A lot more. And your $4 is absolutely right. I mean you just look at recent projects and look at how costs escalate and then what would have taken from an incentive price to justify that project from the outset if the cost numbers have been known. So this is not that complicated. So it's not a greenfield project. We've operated there for 80 years or so. And it's about a straightforward project as you could have, but it's telling for the industry even with this kind of straightforward project the challenge you face. It's cost, it's tailings and we do benefit from infrastructure. This is just a mill expansion. It's not building a new mine. But then there's a challenge of getting workers and housing for workers. So all of this is real telling on the supply side -- I just talked about the demand side support for copper. So this is a great example of a simple project in terms of the relative complexities of projects in our industry, this is relatively simple. And yet, it faces these challenges of being economically justified in today's price. At the outset, I said today's copper price is not a price that\u2019s adequate to stimulate the kind of investments that are going to be needed for this industry. And that's why we're optimistic about future prices. Brian MacArthur : And maybe if I could just ask just on the capital allocation. I mean, you've got lots of options, as you said. But if you're successful for Phase 3, I mean you get as much production there as you would hear, I assume a fraction of the capital cost. Does Bagdad get pushed in that situation? I mean, I get that the world needs probably all of it. But would they get sequenced or are they complementary? I mean I know they don't depend on each other, but are they complementary and you would do both at once if both work? Kathleen Quirk : We're prioritizing the leach initiative. I mean that is one that's a no-brainer for us. It's very, very little capital that we're investing in it and very low increment -- it's our lowest incremental operating cost of anything in the US. And so that's a no-brainer. We're pursuing that regardless, that makes a ton of sense and we're pursuing that regardless. We think the world is going to need something beyond that, obviously. And so on the Bagdad thing, we just want to get it, get it to where -- continue to enhance the optionality in it, and we need to do some things anyway. We're doing some infrastructure on tailings that we would need to do anyway in the future, maybe not as quickly as what we would need with the new project, but we need to do those anyway. So we're going to do those to the extent we can do that efficiently. We want this autonomous thing that we're pursuing. Years ago, people thought you didn't really need autonomous in the US. But now, particularly in these remote locations, you really, really do when you consider the cost of the workforce and the housing limitations and that sort of thing and the opportunities to upscale our employees, we think it checks all of those boxes. So autonomous, we want that to see how that unfolds. So we don't have to pull the trigger on Bagdad now but we want to put it in a position where it can go forward. It makes sense if the world needs more copper to get copper from where we already have it. And so it does -- it's a good project, it's not a barn burner from an economic standpoint, right now. But it will have its day and I think it will get time at some point, it just we aren't predicting exactly when. Richard Adkerson : And Brian, we got a strong enough financial position that we can -- capital is not a barrier for us to do in projects that make sense. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alan Spence with BNP Paribas. Alan Spence : You highlighted the record [Technical Difficulty]\u2026 Richard Adkerson : Alan, you're breaking up on us. Alan Spence : I'll try again, hopefully -- hear me\u2026 Kathleen Quirk : Yes, that's better. Alan Spence : The strong performance for [Technical Difficulty] in [December], is that a level you think could potentially be [Technical Difficulty] through '24 or was there something unique about what happened last month? And also, if you could remind me in terms of timeline to get to 240,000 tons per day run rate? Kathleen Quirk : With respect to [Multiple Speakers] I was going to say Mark Johnson is on the line, he can add to it if you want. But with respect to December, it highlights, we got that SAG mill completed, the new SAG mill completed in December So really, that gave us the ability to put more ore throughput through the concentrators. And with the combination of higher grades and strong recoveries, we had a great month. Now we have the ability to continue to have strong performance. We achieved a lot of records in December but we do have the ability and some upside to continue that. That SAG mill was originally put in the plan because over time, we'll need the additional grinding capacity, et cetera, to take the ore that will be coming. But right now while we're in these higher grade sections, the more we can put through the mills the better the copper production will be. In terms of the $240 million, right now, we don't have $240 million in our plans. But over time, with the addition of Kucing Liar we'll have that capacity to do it. But having SAG 3 does give us some more opportunities in the near term to -- if we continue to have high rates of ore produced from the underground will give us some upside. A mine, we don't talk a lot about but one that we're going to try to keep improving on is the [Gossan] mine, it's a relatively small mine, but very, very high grade. And we've got some plans to bring in some additional, and that's reflected in the five year guidance, but some additional throughput from [Gossan] that will add copper production and gold production. And Mark, I don't know if you want to add into any of those comments. Mark Johnson : Kathleen, the only thing I would add is as part of the KL project, we also add some -- over the shorter term, we had some workflow capacity and optionality at GBC. That allows us to get GBC up from like 120,000 up to 140,000 tons a day in 2026. And at that point, we'll be able to run close to 240,000 tons through the mill. The mine and mill will be matched. And then as you said, the KL come up and then GBC and KL share portions of the ore flow system. But over the short term, we sequenced that part of the KL ore flow that gives us the opportunity at GBC in the much shorter term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Bill Peterson : Nice job on the quarterly execution, thanks for sneaking in my question here. So I wanted to come back to the leaching efforts, the incremental 200 million pounds. I think you mentioned two to three year period, is that a 30 linear ramp or is that more back end weighted? And you've consistently talked about low capital intensity. Can you remind us what the capital associated with this is, I guess, quantified and has there been any CapEx creep in interim similar to just other broader projects? Kathleen Quirk : On the time frame for the incremental 200 million, we have not given a specific time frame. We do feel we can get it done within a couple of years and we'll add whatever we can in the interim. This leach everywhere initiative that we have where we are accessing parts of stockpiles that hadn't been accessed before, getting access to some of the side slopes and some of the areas around the stockpile that we just didn't leach before, that's been a big driver of success and will continue to be. The other one that we're excited about is the targeted drilling. And through our data, we can see where you have situations where the solution that needs to get to the ore has been blocked for some reason over history, and this targeted drilling allows us to get access to it. We are testing this year some abilities to do that more at scale. And that is something that we're really interested to see how that develops and whether that will give us some additional incremental production. We haven't factored that into our plans at this point but we're going to continue to use these covers. We still don't have everything -- the stockpiles are so massive, covering -- spanning particularly Morenci, just miles of area. And so we're still doing the covers. We're still looking for other opportunities to get heat into the stockpiles. We're targeting some pyrite ores in some of our operations that have pyrite in the ores, that is a source of heat as well. But there are a number of things that we're working on that are not the big R&D effort, but things that we can do from an operational standpoint. But well stay tuned, we will -- this is a big initiative and stay tuned will, as we go forward, love to give you a little bit more as we go through 2024 in terms of the time frame. We haven't spent much capital on this initiative. We've already got the infrastructure -- basic infrastructure, the tank house capacity, this is copper that goes to a tank house, not a smelter. And we have already excess latent tank house capacity. We've spent some money but it doesn't round to anything really big. The operating cost, the incremental operating costs of this have been very low on the order of $1 per pound. And so it's just a really, really exciting opportunity for us to generate value. And so as we go forward, we don't see huge amounts of capital either that will come into play. When you get to this piece that's R&D, that's where we need to make sure that all these things can be applied and deployed at scale and can be economic but that thing is ongoing. But the first 400 million pounds we think that we can do that without spending a lot of capital. Richard Adkerson : And you may have noted this, Kathleen, but importantly, there's no permitting issues. And that is a real challenge for any kind of project you do in terms of brownfield expansions and really tougher greenfield expansion. So here, no capital or operating costs, no permitting delays. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Lawson Winder with Bank of America Securities. Lawson Winder : If I could just sneak in one and a half questions. One would be on the current level of the dividend. I mean, is your view that given the cash flow outlook, your view of the copper price, I mean, is this a comfortable level for the dividend for 2024? And then just my half question would be, is there any movement within your existing TCRC contracts to potentially renegotiate those or get the benefit of some of the really, really low spot pricing we're seeing today? Kathleen Quirk : On the dividend question, our Board reviews the financial policy on a regular basis. And we put in place the base dividend, the variable dividend and we've been paying at that level for some time now. We'll continue to review that with the Board. You can see from our results the financial results that we're projecting for 2024 look very good. But we always going to look at what's going on in the market and don't want to put ourselves in a position of running up debt, but we have a good balance sheet. So I don't want to front run anything. The Board will look at this on a regular basis but our financial position is in really excellent shape. The second question on TCRCs, we reach agreement, as you know, on long term TCRCs that are done on fixed contracts once a year. And since then, spot rates have come a lot, lot lower given the tightness in supply. We do sell some things on a spot basis but most of it is sold under these fixed contracts where we have the TCRCs fixed. The other thing is once we get the smelter in Indonesia up and running, we don't have -- we still have with Cerro Verde concentrate that we sell. But everything from Indonesia will be really just processed through our own smelters. Richard Adkerson : And our contracts are long term in terms of volumes, but the TCRCs are renegotiated each year. And you raised a great point for those of you who haven't followed it, but the situation right now with smelters where they can't get concentrate to process is a real strong indicator of where this market is and where it's going. Operator : I'll turn the call back to management for any closing remarks. Kathleen Quirk : We appreciate it, everyone. If there are any follow-ups, feel free to call David and we're available to continue to discuss, and we'll report to you our progress throughout the year. Richard Adkerson : Yes. Thank you for joining us today, and everyone, have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Joint, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. David Joint : Thank you, Regina, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan conference call. Earlier this morning, Freeport reported its first quarter 2024 operating and financial results. A copy of our press release with supplemental schedules and slides is available on our website, fcx.com. Today's conference call is being broadcast live on the Internet. Anyone may listen to the conference call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call. A replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin today's \u2013 our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that our press release and certain of our comments on the call include non-GAAP measures and forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our cautionary language included in our press release and slides and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings, all of which are available on our website. Also on the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Kathleen Quirk, President; Maree Robertson, Senior Vice President and CFO; and other senior members of our management team. Richard will make some opening comments, Kathleen will review our slide materials and then we'll open up the call for questions. I would now like to call \u2013 turn the call over to Richard. Richard Adkerson : Thank you, David, and thank you all for joining us. We're really pleased today to report our first quarter results. They reflect a continuation of Freeport's long-running success in executing our business plans. Kathleen will present our results, as David said, and then we'll answer your questions. Kathleen will become Freeport's CEO, effective with our Annual Shareholders Meeting on June 11. I will continue as Chairman and support Kathleen and our management team on important strategic issues and external relations. This will be the most seamless management transition in history. There's been a 20-year transition, in fact. Coincidentally, Kathleen joined Freeport shortly after I did 35 years ago and I've been an adviser to the company for the previous two decades. She advanced through our finance group to become CFO when I became CEO 20 years ago. And since then, she has been integral to the management of the company. When I became Chairman three years ago, I made a personal commitment to build a sustainable Board and a sustainable management team. And since that time, we've added six high-quality independent directors, new directors, which together with our continuing directors comprise a very strong independent board to represent our shareholders. We bolstered our staff with internal promotions and external hires. Freeport is strongly positioned for the future, and I'm personally proud to be able to say that at this point. 20 years ago, we made a strategic commitment to copper based on the fundamentals of supply and demand for the commodity. The validity of that commitment has never been more evident, and the best is yet to come. My personal enthusiasm for Freeport's future has never been stronger. I cannot be more pleased with our Board and with our management team under Kathleen's leadership. Kathleen, I'll turn the call over to you for your slides. Kathleen Quirk : Great, and thank you, Richard. And a special thank you to you for your outstanding and visionary leadership during your long tender as our \u2013 tenure as our CEO. As I prepare to become CEO in June, I'm focused on our copper-leading strategy centered on reliable execution of our plans, disciplined cost and capital management and continuing our drive for profitable growth. Our seasoned team knows this business has a proven ability to navigate challenges and a passion for finding value in our assets. I look forward to building on our past success and to leading our company to new highs in the future. Starting on Page 3, Slide 3, we have a new annual report out with this year's theme being the value of copper. The report is available on our website. It highlights our performance, our copper-focused strategy and our strength as a premier copper producer. We'll also be publishing our annual sustainability report, which will be available on our website later this week. This report, which we've been doing for some time now, details our environmental and social performance, which we take very seriously as part of our commitment to responsible production. On Slide 4, we present our key focus areas of \u2013 for 2024. These are the same items we discussed in our January call and we thought it would be good to show these again for reference so you can track our progress against these areas as we go through the year. On Slide 5, turning to the first quarter highlights. We're off to a really good start so far in 2024. As summarized, we exceeded our guidance for first quarter copper sales. Gold sales were in line with our estimates and consolidated unit net cash costs were better than forecast. We generated strong margins and cash flows during the quarter with $2.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA and $1.9 billion in operating cash flows, and that was at an average copper price of $3.94 per pound. Capital expenditures, excluding $0.5 billion for the Indonesian smelter project totaled $800 million in the quarter, and we reduced our net debt. We made great progress on several important initiatives, including on the Indonesian smelter, which is scheduled to start up in June, building momentum in our innovative copper leach initiative and continuing to build optionality in our organic growth pipeline. Market conditions are increasingly positive. They are growing recognition of factors, driving favorable fundamentals in copper and we've also seen a rise in gold prices year-to-date. Recall that Grasberg is one of the world's largest mines in terms of both copper and gold production. Moving to copper markets, starting on Slide 6, the growing intensity of use of copper in the global economy is supported by secular trends, particularly in electrification. Copper is a foundational, essential metal when it comes to electrification, and the world is becoming more and more focused on copper-intensive energy applications. New massive investment in the power grid, renewable generation, technology infrastructure and transportation are driving increased demand for copper and forecasts call for above-trend growth and demand for the foreseeable future. This is occurring at a time when there are constraints on existing supplies, an absence of major new copper development projects and extended multiyear lead times for supply development, pointing to tight market conditions for an extended period of time. Copper producers, including us, at Freeport have been citing physical market tightness for some time. And in the last several weeks, the copper price has risen to reflect the reality of the market situation. Based on historical periods of above trend growth in demand, we may be in the early stages of a repricing for long-term copper prices. And we illustrate this on Slide 7, where we show how copper prices responded 20 years ago when China emerged as a major consumer of copper. You can see on this chart that within 12 months, the copper price increased by 40% and was up nearly four times within a three-year period. During 2023, the secular drivers for copper demand provide a growth in demand despite weakness in some of the more cyclical drivers of copper demand. In the fourth quarter of last year, industry announcements of sizable supply disruptions tightened the market significantly. This is clearly evident when you look at the physical concentrate markets where smelters drop TC, treatment charges, sharply as a result of the shortage of concentrate supply. Notably, recent manufacturing data points also indicate that the global economy is recovering. Recently improved macroeconomic sentiment, combined with physical market conditions have driven prices higher, copper prices higher year-to-date, and many analysts are now projecting significantly higher copper prices in the future. At Freeport, our financial performance is highly levered to copper prices, as you'll see from our sensitivities; we'll review later in the presentation. We're not predicting where prices will go from here, and recognize there will be volatility. But clearly, the fundamentals point to an extended period of deficits and significantly higher copper prices over the long term. That's very positive for a company like ours with large-scale, long-life producing assets and organic development opportunities. Now I will cover the operating highlights from the quarter. This is presented on Slide 8. We are summarizing the key operating highlights by geographic region. In the U.S., we continue to work to mitigate the impact of lower ore grades by focusing on initiatives to improve efficiency and reliability of our equipment, the productivity of our workforce and sharpening our focus on cost reduction. We're making progress in these areas, but we still have work to do to regain our goal of being at the top of the industry in terms of efficiency and productivity. Our innovative leach initiative is providing incremental volumes and has helped us mitigate the impact of lower ore grades. As we previously reported, we reached over our 200 million pound per annum run rate, we've got several initiatives in progress to scale this to the 300 million-pound to 400 million-pound per annum range over the next two years. We're also continuing to take advantage of new technologies and automation across the portfolio, which we believe have a lot of potential to move the needle as we go forward. In South America, we \u2013 our ore milled was slightly below 400,000 metric tons of ore per day at Cerro Verde. Team worked through several challenges during the quarter associated with material types, which required optimizing mill throughput to address recoveries. And the team was successful in achieving copper volume targets by increasing mine rates and accessing higher than planned grades. Our moly byproduct volumes were impacted, however, by low recoveries associated with the material types and progress is being made to address this. At our El Abra mine in Chile, we had a good quarter, and we met expectations. We are also pleased to report that Cerro Verde recently finalized an agreement for a new four-year labor agreement with its workforce. In Indonesia, we had another exceptional quarter of performance. Both copper and gold production exceeded our forecast with higher mill rates, higher ore grades and recoveries. Our net unit cash costs for the quarter in Indonesia was a net credit of $0.12 per pound. That means our gold byproduct credits more than offset all of the cash production costs. Our underground ore mined, which is the largest block-cave mine district in the world averaged 220,000 tons per day that was above the fourth quarter of 2023 and significantly above last year's first quarter. The Grasberg Block Cave mine is our largest in the district, and it continues to achieve strong performance. We've also increased our rates at the extra high-grade smaller mine at Big Gossan by nearly 30%. Our new SAG mill, which we installed at the end of last year, is performing very well. We're nearing completion of a mill recovery project, and that will enable higher mill recoveries in the future. And our team there is just doing outstanding work in sustaining and optimizing value from this large resource position. Topping it off the PT-FI team recently finalized a new two-year labor agreement with our workforce. Give a report on Slide 9 of where we stand with our smelter project and the completion of this new smelter in Indonesia is a very important catalyst for us, as we work to secure an extension of our long-term operating rights in Indonesia. We made substantial progress in the first quarter and now we're focused on the remaining critical path and transitioning to commissioning and start-up activities. We're on track to begin hitting the furnaces during June, followed by concentrate process in August and first cathode in October. We're working closely with the Indonesian government to continue to export concentrates and anode slimes until the smelter and precious metals are fully operational, and we expect that by year-end when we will become a PT-FI, a fully integrated metals producer. Discussions with the government to-date are positive and that's supported by the project status and the startup plans. In terms of our startup, we have a very talented local team who will be supported by a large team of Freeporters from around the globe, including from our Spanish operations and our U.S. smelting operations to support an efficient startup. We're very focused on our growth and optionality in our growth pipeline, and we've got a summary on Slide 10, where we go through where we stand on the various projects. We have dedicated teams working on advancing opportunities to grow production in the future. And here, you'll see the update for each of the major initiatives underway, starting with the innovative leach initiative where our team has several work streams in progress to take our initial success and build substantial scale. This project has the highest net present value potential of any project we have seen historically because of low capital intensity, low incremental operating costs. And at Freeport, we're uniquely positioned to capture this value with our sizable existing footprint, technical know-how and new technologies available to us. At our Bagdad operation in Northwest Arizona, we talked about it on our last call. And now we're continuing to take steps to derisk the brownfield expansion project by converting the existing haul truck fleet to fully autonomous, expanding housing infrastructure at the site and expanding our tailings facilities. We're also continuing to monitor labor market conditions in Arizona and hope to be in a position to make an investment decision by the end of next year. From there, the project would take about three to four years to construct. At our Lone Star, Safford brownfield project in Eastern Arizona, we're commencing a pre-feasibility study this year to define and frame a major expansion. As we've been talking about over many quarters, we have a sizable resource here and expect this district will become a major cornerstone asset for us in Arizona during the next decade. At El Abra, in Chile, we have a large resource that can support a new concentrator of scale and we're looking at a concentrator similar to the size of the Cerro Verde concentrator expansion we installed nearly 10 years ago. We've done substantial work to define the project, and we're currently in the process of retesting the economics and taking a hard look at capital costs in light of the recent industry experience in Chile. We're working to be in a position to file an environmental impact statement by the end of next year, and this project would require seven to eight years of lead time because of permitting requirements. In Indonesia, we're continuing to advance our large-scale Kucing Liar development to commence production by 2030. We also have several additional exploration targets in the district and expect to have additional long-term development options that would become available with an extension of our operating rights beyond 2041. We're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach, targeting opportunities that can be executed efficiently and profitably and where we think we can create value for our shareholders. We wanted to take you through a little bit of our leach history on Slide 11 that provides history of what we've achieved to-date on this innovative project. We started on this journey two years ago with data analytics and new operating practices to tap into our large stockpiles to recover copper from material that was previously mined. Through a combination of actions to achieve greater heat retention in the stockpiles, gaining access to areas of the stockpiles that had not been optimally leached historically, and through the use of better identification of trap potential, we\u2019ve been successful in adding incremental copper previously thought to be unrecoverable. This initiative has grown now to be a major value driver for our Americas business, particularly for our largest U.S. mine in Morenci. As we mentioned, we achieved our initial target for an annual run rate of 200 million pounds per annum, now focused on doubling this or scaling what we\u2019ve learned to date. To date, the success has largely been operationally driven, complemented by new data and technology. At the same time, in parallel, we\u2019re advancing studies on new additives that could boost recoveries and we\u2019re exploring options for adding heat to existing stockpiles to generate incremental copper. In the aggregate, these initiatives have the potential to reach 800 million pounds per annum and that\u2019s the equivalent of a large-scale copper mine with low capital intensity, low cost and a low carbon footprint. About half of this can be achieved through further scaling, as we mentioned, and the other half relates to technology under development. The value potential is very attractive, particularly for Freeport given our large quantities of suitable materially \u2013 material that we previously mined. In terms of our timing of all this on Slide 12, we summarized potential growth and that we frame it in near-term, medium-term and longer-term horizons. We\u2019ve outlined identified projects in the Americas, totaling 1.7 billion pounds and the Kucing Liar project currently in development in Indonesia, and that\u2019s expected to continue to support long-term production profiles in the Grasberg District. In the two to three-year category, we set our focus on incremental production, on scaling our leach initiatives and operational improvement projects. Together, the potential from these opportunities total 400 million pounds and do not require significant investment or long lead times. In three to five-year category, we\u2019ve got the Bagdad expansion opportunity and the additional potential from our leach initiatives. El Abra is reflected in the seven to eight-year category and Lone Star is not on here, but it\u2019s also a major opportunity, which we\u2019re currently defining. It\u2019s likely a bit further out, but we feel it will be a major new opportunity for us as we go forward. The KL development in Indonesia is proceeding on schedule. We expect to commence production before 2030 and ramp up to over 500 million pounds of copper and 500,000 ounces of gold, which is meaningful operation. In Indonesia, an extension of our rights beyond 2041 would open substantial opportunity for reserve and resource expansion and continuation of large-scale mining in one of the world\u2019s largest and highest grade copper and gold mining districts. We\u2019re in a strong position, as you see here, to continue our leadership role in supplying copper to a world with growing requirements. On Slide 13, as we usually do, we show our three-year outlook for sales volume of copper, gold and molybdenum. We\u2019ve increased our 2024 copper sales by about 1.5%, reflecting the first quarter outperformance. The rest of the guidance is similar to our outlook at the start of the year. We\u2019re also estimating consolidated net unit cash costs to approximate $1.57 per pound on a consolidated basis that\u2019s slightly below our previous guidance of $1.60 per pound. We\u2019ve got some details of the makeup of this average presented on Slide 25 in the restaurants materials. With a strong cash flow generator, as you can see on Slide 14, where we show modeled results for our EBITDA and cash flows at various copper prices ranging from $4 per pound to $5 per pound for the average of 2025 and 2026. We\u2019re using our current volume estimates for 2025 and 2026, our cost estimates and we\u2019re holding gold flat here at $2,300 per ounce and molybdenum at $20 an ounce for illustration. Under this scenario, annual EBITDA would range from almost $11 billion per annum at $4 copper to in excess of $15 billion per annum at $5 copper and our operating cash flows would range from over $7.5 billion per year at $4 copper and over $11 billion per year at $5 per pound copper. We\u2019ve got sensitivities to the various commodities on the right with long life reserves, large-scale production; we\u2019re extremely well-positioned to benefit from improved pricing, providing substantial cash flow for investments in our organic growth and cash returns to shareholders on our performance-based payout framework. On Slide 15, we show our current estimates for capital expenditures for 2024 and 2025. Not much has changed since our last update. $3.6 billion is projected for 2024, which is consistent with our prior guidance. And in 2025, we estimate CapEx will total about $3.9 billion. That\u2019s about $100 million higher than the January estimate and reflects timing changes for our Kucing Liar project spend for 2025. During this period \u2013 during this two-year period, discretionary projects totaled $2.5 billion. This is \u2013 this category reflects the capital investments we're making in new projects that under our financial policy, are funded with the half of available cash that is not distributed. And these projects are all value-enhancing initiatives, and we've got some details in the back \u2013 in the reference materials. Finally, getting to financial policy on Slide 16. We reiterate the policy priorities centered on a strong balance sheet, cash returns to shareholders and investments and value-enhancing growth projects. Balance sheet continues to be very strong. We've got great metrics \u2013 credit metrics and significant flexibility within our debt targets to execute on our projects. As indicated here, we've distributed about $4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases since starting this new financial policy and we've got a very attractive future long-term portfolio that will enable us to continue to build long-term value for shareholders. A sustained higher price for copper will drive higher cash returns to shareholders while allowing us to invest in future value-oriented growth. We're going to continue to actively monitor the market conditions. We'll carefully manage the timing of our projects and make sure that our financial flexibility remains strong. In closing, our global team is driven by value, and we continue to focus on what matters in our business by executing our plans responsibly, safely and efficiently and maximizing the value of our vast resources. We thank you all for your attention, and we'll now open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Liam Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Liam Fitzpatrick : Good morning, Kathleen. Kathleen Quirk : Good morning. Liam Fitzpatrick : Good morning. Liam Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank. The first question is just on your U.S. assets. You've been talking about for some time, the productivity improvements that you're targeting. Could you give us a bit more color on when we should expect some of this to be visible in the numbers? And what sort of change are you hoping for? Is this just to do better than inflation? Or could there be more of a step change at some stage? And then the second question, two parts to it really is just on your projects. Firstly, on Bagdad, I think the timing you give in the presentation suggests you could make an investment decision next year. I just wanted to check that's the right timing to think about. And then at El Abra, if you do nothing at that mine, when will it be facing a more material drop off in grades? Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, Liam. In terms of the U.S. operations, what we're faced with right now is very low ore grades, the lowest ore grades we've had in \u2013 since 2010. So that is structurally a challenge for us. Over the last couple of years, we've also been dealing with labor shortages in the U.S. and needing to make sure that our people are trained and can gain the efficiencies that we've had in 2019 before COVID. We're making really good progress with the work that we're doing. It's not easy work. It's hard work every single day, but we know what the work is. And we've got to make sure that our equipment is operating that we're getting the asset efficiencies in our equipment that we should be getting. If we look back over the last couple of years, we haven't gotten the asset efficiencies that we've had historically. And so we've been working on that. We've been working on maintenance to make sure that our equipment health is strong; we're working on training of a workforce that's less experienced. And it's just basic blocking and tackling, but the headwind is the ore grades. And we're really happy with the results of the leach initiative, and that's provided us with some benefits as we've gone through these lower ore grades. But we still think we have a lot of potential. And we're making the progress. We've got detailed scorecards of what we're doing every day in all the drivers of what makes us efficient. Everybody is focused on it. We're also focused on technology advancements. You read about the advancements we have at Bagdad, where we're looking to convert the haul truck fleet there to fully autonomous. We've got all kinds of technology initiatives available to us that we haven't had historically. And I think that is a key driver for us also as we look at improving our North American operations. But we think we do have opportunities within the portfolio, within the North American portfolio to increase production as we gain productivity and that\u2019s the 200 million pound a year range. And that\u2019s a focus of ours and I think we\u2019re on the path. It doesn\u2019t happen overnight, but it takes working every day and discipline around it. But we know what to focus on. Regarding your question at Bagdad, we\u2019ve got the study done. What we\u2019re focused on there is really this workforce situation where we want to make sure that when we go forward with the project that we can do it efficiently and that we can deliver the project within the capital cost estimates and within the timeframes. And so we want to take our time in doing additional work, de-risking the plan as we go forward over the next 18 months. And then once we get this autonomous fleet converted, we\u2019ll be in a position to reassess the situation and be in a position to move forward. It\u2019s not \u2013 in an ordinary environment, it\u2019s not a complex project. It\u2019s a brownfield project where we have a substantial history in the district. The issue really gets to the labor market conditions and also, we want to continue to monitor the copper markets, et cetera, as we always do. But this is a very executable plan if we can deal with the workforce challenges that we have in Arizona, which is a very competitive place right now given all the activity in the state. With respect to El Abra, we\u2019re looking at the current operation, which is very small relative to the size of Freeport, has got life to it over the next several years and will start to decline, probably give us another 10 years, but we have some water. We\u2019ve got to get some water extensions and things that we\u2019re working on there. But the El Abra project is very exciting from the standpoint of the resource. It\u2019s very large. It\u2019s not in our current reserves. And so we have the ability to add reserves of scale. In terms of the overall project, like I mentioned, we\u2019ve done a lot of work on it. We feel very good about being able to execute it. But the things that we\u2019re working on there are really going back and looking at our capital cost estimates really stress testing those, understanding what happened at other projects in Chile and figuring out, make sure we\u2019re comfortable that the economics of the project are as good as they look initially. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re testing now. The long lead time in Chile is because of the permitting requirements. It takes an extended period of time to get the data necessary to file the application. And then as you know, there\u2019s a review period that can span two to three years. And I know Chile is working to streamline its permitting that would be helpful for us as well. But really, what we\u2019re focused on there is getting to a point where we can file the environmental impact statement and then that will give us additional optionality. But there\u2019s good value in that project for us. Liam Fitzpatrick : Okay. That\u2019s great color. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Chris LaFemina : Hi, Richard and Kathleen. Thanks for taking my question. First, I just wanted to say congratulations on the operating performance in Indonesia. That has been very impressive. And once again, this past quarter, pretty incredible what you\u2019ve done there, so congrats on that. And then secondly, I just wanted to ask a follow-up on the trends in cost in the U.S. So if you did, what, 51 million pounds of leach \u2013 production from that new leaching initiatives in the U.S. in the first quarter. And if we assume that\u2019s around $1 a pound, that would imply that the rest of your production in the U.S. is around $3.35, $3.40 a pound for net cash cost. And then if we add to that sustaining CapEx, it\u2019s probably something close to $4 a pound free cash flow breakeven. So my first question is, is that right? Are you at around $4 a pound free cash flow breakeven in the U.S. if you exclude the benefit of the new leaching initiatives? Kathleen Quirk : In terms of the leaching initiatives, when you look at our reported cash costs, you have to consider that until we add additional pounds to the stockpiles. What we\u2019re recording as our average cost is reflective of our average cost of per unit and stockpiles. So as we gain more confidence, the denominator will drop, so we\u2019re pulling those pounds out now out of the stockpiles are reflecting like a $3 average cost. When in reality, the incremental cost is closer to $1. So as we get more confidence and we\u2019re able to add more pounds, multiyear amounts of this leach reserve, you'll see that unit costs come down. But in terms of your analysis, it may be shy of the $4 you're talking about, but we are in a lower grade area of the North America right now. And so our unit costs are relatively high compared to historical levels. We've had cost inflation as everybody has seen, but the other area where we're focused on is more on the things that we can control. And we've seen some of the inflationary pressures moderate, but the things that we want to continue to work on is to avoid unplanned maintenance, to avoid \u2013 to reduce our maintenance costs. And also as we get more workers within our own team, and we get those workers trained up, it will reduce our reliance on contractors, which has been a big cost for us. And that's what we've had to do during this period of the labor challenges is rely more on contractors, and so right now, we're really rationalizing contractors and training up our people to be able to do this work. So the leach opportunity, big picture, is really going to be a step change, though, as we go forward in the U.S. And if we're able to be successful in adding another 200 million pounds from the leach initiative at a very low incremental cost and improving our technology \u2013 I mean, our productivity gains, you'll see our costs start to trend a lot lower in the U.S., and that's what we're focused on. That's what Josh and his team are focused on. Maree is very focused on it as well and her team. So we're all over this, Chris. Chris LaFemina : Right. So that $1 per pound cash cost for leaching is not what's reflected in the production cost in the first quarter and that was reflected in the 2024 full year guidance, right? You're using something like $3 a pound in the guidance as well? Kathleen Quirk : Yes. It's just coming out at the average when we report it. And the way it will come down on our financial books is with an increase in estimates and future estimates, because the costs are spread over what's remaining in the stockpiles. And as we add more volumes to the stockpiles, that will reduce the incremental cost and be reflective really truly of what's really occurring. Chris LaFemina : Got it. Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : From a cash flow standpoint, it doesn't affect cash flow. So the cash flow, we really are getting the benefit of the incremental cost below $1. Chris LaFemina : So if we think about the cash flow, you have the smelter construction is nearly complete. You're going to one way or another, not be paying royalties at the smelters ramped up. Copper price is obviously higher\u2026 Kathleen Quirk : Duty. Chris LaFemina : Duty, sorry, the copper price is obviously higher, gold price is higher, balance sheet is clean. You have your performance-based capital return policy, which you haven't really executed on in the last year. You've had a lot going on, but I'm just wondering in terms of timing of when we could see those supplemental capital returns. Is that something the Board will consider imminently? Or is it kind of \u2013 do we have to get through certain events before you consider delivering those capital returns? Thanks. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. Well, we have been executing under the policy. We've distributed since we started the policy, 50% of our available cash flow. And so all the items that you cite and that excludes the smelter, but all the items that you cite are building to give us more cash that will be available for distribution. And we'll continue to file that policy of higher prices is going to be more cash flows and more cash returns to shareholders. And that is the policy. Chris LaFemina : Great. Thank you very much. Good luck. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Kathleen Quirk : Hi, Mike. Michael Dudas : Good morning, David, Richard and Kathleen. Richard Adkerson : Hey, Mike. Michael Dudas : Hi, I think you mentioned in response to the question about operating costs and cost moderation. So maybe you can touch a little bit more on what you're seeing on the ground more specifically in your North America and South American mines on cost improvement, what your expectations are versus what it might have been a few months ago? And how are you seeing that in some of the feasibility studies that you're working on and completed? And what kind of \u2013 have we seen double-digit inflation continuing on the capital cost side that's going to continue to make it a little bit more challenging for Freeport and others to really follow through and provide the material of our market needs? Kathleen Quirk : Yes. I think those issues have moderated a bunch, and we're getting more into a stable situation, while it's higher than it has been. It is more stable. For instance, when we were going out for bids for things a year or two ago, you might get one bidder on a project. And now things are opening up some more for us. So on that part, I think it's stabilized now. We\u2019ll continue to test it. And whenever we run our projects and run our economics, we always look at a range of what the capital costs are and what the sensitivities are to higher or lower capital spend. But in terms of the extremes that we have seen in the recent years, we\u2019re not encountering that right now. And in terms of commodity input costs and things, they\u2019ve been more moderate and more stable than we\u2019ve seen in some time. We all know that that can change, but it has been more stable. The things that we need to work on are particularly in the U.S. of this issue I mentioned with respect to the labor force and the experience levels and with contractors. And the third thing, and one of the most important is reliable asset efficiency. And so those are the challenges that we have and we\u2019re working on them. I feel very confident that we\u2019re turning the corner on that. We\u2019re continuing to make good progress on really driving efficiency within the U.S. operations. We haven\u2019t had the issue in South America and in Indonesia. We\u2019ve got a much more stable workforce, much more experienced workforce. We\u2019ve also benefited there from a stronger dollar. So many of our \u2013 much of our labor cost is in foreign currency. So we have benefited there from a stronger dollar and have not seen, obviously haven\u2019t seen that benefit in the U.S. But we do believe there are some things within our control that we\u2019re focused on now. And now that things have moderated some with inflation. We\u2019ve got a clear focus on being as efficient as we can, recognizing that low grades becomes a challenge. But we want to do better than inflation. I mean, that\u2019s what we want to make sure that we can overcome inflation in our costs with productivity gains and efficiency gains. And we\u2019ve got technologies available to us that we haven\u2019t had in the past. And I think as a company, we\u2019re going to be leaning a lot more into innovation as a tool to help us with productivity. Michael Dudas : Excellent, Kathleen. Thank you. Richard Adkerson : Let me just add one point on the broader copper market implications of that question. Kathleen described very well the things we\u2019re doing within our company. And when you look back at our cost history in relation to general inflation, we\u2019ve done a good job with our supply chain team. But the shocking amount of overruns on the major project in Chile, but elsewhere and also the political situation in Panama, as I talk with CEOs around the industry, makes us all step back and say we have to be careful. We have to be careful because the overruns are more than just simply inflation. And we\u2019re still trying to get our arms around what\u2019s going on with these projects to cause them to be delayed and to have the kind of cost situations they have. At the end of the day, this is just another major element for the positive outlook for copper prices. I mean, if these problems were easily solved and this is a tough business, you wouldn\u2019t have the supply shortfalls that we\u2019re having. And that\u2019s been a major factor from seeing the recent run up in copper prices. And it\u2019s also something that\u2019s very supportive for the longer-term outlook for copper prices. Michael Dudas : Well said, Richard. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Kathleen Quirk : Hey, Bill. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, Kathleen, Richard, it\u2019s actually Bennett on for Bill this morning. Kathleen Quirk : Hey, Bennett. Unidentified Analyst : If I could, I wanted to ask what, if any, is the company\u2019s current dialogue with the new leadership in Indonesia and how you see that relationship developing over time. Kathleen Quirk : Well, the transition doesn\u2019t take place until October, and we\u2019re continuing to work with the existing administration. We\u2019ve got some matters that we\u2019re working together on with respect to the concentrate license that we talked about earlier as well as the IUPK extension. And so we\u2019re continuing to work with the current administration on these matters. We have a long history in Indonesia. We just celebrated 57 years of operation there. And we\u2019ve worked with many governments over the years and many administrations. And we feel very confident that we\u2019ll continue to have good relations with the new administration. And what we focus on, we\u2019re not \u2013 we don\u2019t get involved in politics. So we focus on what we do there to be a good citizen of Indonesia, to provide benefits to the national government, the local government, all of our workforce, the community and stakeholder work that we do there is very important and that\u2019s \u2013 that lasts that survives administrations. And so we really focus on the things that make the asset good for Indonesia and good for all the stakeholders. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue. Richard, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to those comments? Richard Adkerson : Sure. I\u2019ve been going to Indonesia now for all my career with Freeport over 35 years, and our relationships have never been better. I was just in Washington Friday evening for a reception to celebrate 75 years of positive relationships between the U.S. government and the Republic of Indonesia and the Finance Minister, Sri Mulyani and the Central Bank Governor Perry were there. And I wish you all could just hear the positive things that were set around this table of a number of companies and a number of Indonesian government officials about the current way that Freeport is viewed and how positive they see our partnership is in building PT-FI, which is an Indonesian company and to be in such a success for all the stakeholders. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. That's helpful. And if I could just squeeze in one more on the topic regarding the future mining rates in Indonesia, we saw a headline last week that these could potentially be granted as soon as this upcoming June. So I'm wondering if there's any updates you can provide there? And what additional ask maybe on the table from the government there? Richard Adkerson : Let me just say that we have gotten \u2013 we have an agreement with the government on the structure beyond 2041. There's no controversy over that, and there's general support for it. The \u2013 I believe the fact that the election occurred and we just went through Ramadan is having an effect on the timing, but we're very pleased. I mean it's important to know that we currently under our existing permit have no rights to anything beyond 2041. And it makes no sense for any stakeholder to have this operation run without having a long-term plan for it in terms of doing more drilling to understand what resources are there, doing long-term planning or how those resources will be developed. The Indonesian \u2013 our Indonesian shareholder mines ID understands that. The Ministry of Mines understands that the President's Office does as well. So I'm confident we're going to be able to get that. As always, there's uncertainties as to when the actual formalities will be concluded to grant the regulations to allow us to continue. But there's no real controversy about the structure going forward. Kathleen Quirk : And delivery of the smelter is an important part of that. And the government is very pleased with the progress we've made in getting the smelter to a point where it can be commissioned next quarter \u2013 this quarter. Unidentified Analyst : All right. Understood. Thank you very much and best of luck going forward. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, Bennett. Richard Adkerson : Thanks, Bannett. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Lawson Winder with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Lawson Winder : Hi. Good morning. Richard Adkerson : Good morning, Lawson. Lawson Winder : Good morning, operator. Yes. Good morning Richard and Kathleen. Thank you for today's update. Maybe just on Cerro Verde, if I could, is there still a pathway to consistently exceeding well over 400,000 tons per day at that asset? Kathleen Quirk : Absolutely. Richard Adkerson : I can't tell you what a great job our team down there has done. I visited recently and I mean, just the spirit, the relationships with the local community. And as you all know, Peru is a very complicated country and has a lot of issues politically and economically to deal with, but it is just an uplifting experience to see what our team has done down there. I had some friends with me and to see an operation where we're moving 400,000 \u2013 over 400,000 metric tons of material a day, that's the equivalent of 80,000 street dump trucks moving material in a single day. And so it's an inspiration quite frank, for me to see it. The community supports us. We've got a great workforce. We're actually bringing some of our Peruvian operating people to work in Arizona and New Mexico to support our operations there, but it's an uplifting place to go for me. Kathleen Quirk : Lawson, it's not without challenges this team has demonstrated, as Richard said, that they can \u2013 they're very resilient team and can deal with a lot of different challenges. But water is something that is always a concern. We did with our expansion almost 10 years ago to put in a water treatment facility, and we provide clean water to the community, and it also supports our own operations. But particularly during this time where we've been through El Nino and droughts and there's always a focus on water, but the ore is there, the resource is there, and the team has got \u2013 we've got the assets there and the team has got really good work practices. And as Richard said, the relationship with the community is top-notch. Lawson Winder : Okay. That addresses my question. Thank you very much. Richard Adkerson : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of John Tumazos from John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead. John Tumazos : Thank you very much. In the first quarter, the minority interest was $689, and the income to shareholders was $473. Could we interpret from that that the U.S. mines made about $200 million less profits than the overhead or the U.S. operations are losing money? And what are the short term remedies? For example, how quickly can you convert to autonomous drugs and mitigate wage inflation, et cetera? Richard Adkerson : But one thing, John. Kathleen, let me say one thing to John before you answer the question, Kathleen. And I've seen some of your writings, John, and the minority ownership in PT-FI came about from the Rio Tinto deal in the mid-1990s, and that really hasn't changed. That just was transferred to the government of Indonesia and that joint venture interest was converted to shares. But in 2018, Freeport, through the agreement that we reached, maintained virtually the same economic interest in the mine that we've had all along. So this wasn't something that happened because of the government, but because of a deal that was cut back in the mid-1990s. And you know, the, when you look through it, and I talk with our Americas people and our people in the U.S. about it, because even though our mines in the U.S. are low grade, because of the fact we have a very favorable income tax situation in the U.S., bolstered by net operating loss carryforwards, we own our lands in fees, so there's no royalties. We get community support for schools and hospitals and our workers. We don't have to provide for the same things we do overseas that we do overseas. And so the profitability of those mines is really very attractive. And that's what makes these growth opportunities in the U.S. so attractive for Freeport. You and I both remember a time when people thought the Southwest copper district was dead. And right now it's a big part of the future for our country in terms of providing the copper resource needed for the energy transition and electrification broadly. But also it's a great opportunity for our shareholders to create value for Freeport, to create value for our shareholders. Kathleen Quirk : John, I was just going to point you to the press release. There's some, in the back of the press release, there's some segment analysis, and you can look at the segments we show, how much the U.S. mines contributed, etcetera. And if that doesn't answer your question, just follow up with us afterward. John Tumazos : Thank you. Operator : Our last question will come from the line of Martin Malloy with Johnson Rice and Company. Please go ahead. Kathleen Quirk : Hi, Marty. Martin Malloy : Good morning. I wanted to ask, with your leaching technology, does that give you a competitive advantage and maybe looking at acquisition opportunities? Kathleen Quirk : Well, we're focused on \u2013 I mean, we've got almost 40 billion pounds in our own in our inventory. And that doesn't include some really old areas where we're not active. But yes, I mean, to answer your question, it does give us some interest in some things that may have this opportunity to be able to apply our know-how to it. But we're really focused on our own organic situation. If an opportunity came available that had this, we would be interested in seeing what we could make out of it. But we've got a lot within our portfolio to be able to get substantial value for our shareholders from. Richard Adkerson : Yes. And a lot is understating it. It is massive, what we have the opportunity to develop from what's already owned by Freeport from our existing stockpiles and Kathleen mentioned our historical stockpiles. So yes, an opportunity came along, but I'm not expecting it. I think that we're going to be able to grow tremendous amounts of value doing with what we have, which now the company really has, others have opportunities. No one else has it in this kind of scale that we do. Martin Malloy : Thank you. Operator : With that, we'll turn the call over to management for any closing remarks. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, everyone, for all your good questions today and your interest in Freeport, and we look forward to reporting in the future on our progress. Richard Adkerson : Thank you, all. Operator : That concludes our call for today. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.",

Richard will make some few opening comments, Kathleen will review our slide materials, and then we'll open up the call for questions. Richard? Richard Adkerson : Thank you, David and thank you all for joining us today. Well, we've seen quite a couple of months of volatility in the markets. I was on CNBC right when copper hit $5 for the first time ever, and I had big smiles on my face. Now, the reality of the copper markets have shown up and I just want to say a couple of comments about it. Many of you have heard me say for a long time that copper move from a cyclical metal that it had been in years past to one that's been driven more by episodic events. In China, its demand had been growing recently and has set records even in the face of poor performance in certain sectors, most notably the property segment. Recently, demand has been softening in other sectors. Credit markets in China have been soft, the high prices led to destocking. There's been a very tight concentrate market, which persists, TCs and RCs are record low levels and that's brought a lot of scrap to the marketplace. The government incentivized scrap for a period of time. And as a result, was a destocking, the softening demand, global inventories have risen, and that has triggered macro trading in commodities, particularly after the disappointment that the Third Plenum didn't result in a clear statement of incentivizing the economy in China. This simply won't last. There's limits to destocking, China will respond to its economy, there's underlying strength there, and we're very confident that this will improve over time. In fact, they've taken the first step with the recent interest rate cut. Underlying all of this is really the fundamentals of the global copper marketplace. The world is getting more and more electrified with connectivity, with dealing with carbon emissions, challenges there, but that's the fact that the world has to deal with A1 and Jeff Currie, recently talked about the importance of increased defense spending and that creates another element of demand. Supply changes, supply challenges continue and in certain cases are growing. And so as we look forward, our strategy is based on a fundamentally positive outlook about long-term copper demand and the reality of developing new supplies to meet that demand. It was really something to see, copper at $5. And I'll tell you, we're going to see it again. I want to make one quick comment to recognize our team for the great work we've done in reaching the commissioning of our new smelter in Indonesia. This was a major project, the world's largest single-line smelter. Construction is essentially complete. We posted a new video on our website last evening. I encourage you all to watch it just to see the size and scale of this new world-class facility. It's really something to visit it and seeing just the extent of the facility. This was a key commitment we made to the government of Indonesia in 2018, when we resolved to reach a global resolution of the issues that had been under discussion for so many years, it's a strategic importance for our business interest in Indonesia for the long-term by becoming a fully-integrated producer there with our mining operations, PT-FI will now be able to apply for extension of its operations for the long-term, which will really enhance the benefits of all stakeholders; the government, the people of Papua, our employees, Freeport and all shareholders and our partner, MIND ID, a state-owned company. Project has been in works for several years in a world that was challenged during this period of time by COVID and inflationary factors that have been evident in so many projects around our copper industry, it's really accomplishment by our team to bring this in on time and with reasonable budget spending on it. It's quite a facility. Take a look at the video. We are looking forward to getting our extension and then developing our plans to maximize the value of this resource over its life and not have any time limit of 2041 facing it. So we're really encouraged by -- and again, our team just did a tremendous job there. Kathleen, I'll turn it over to you. Kathleen Quirk : Okay. Thank you, Richard, and I'm going to start on Slide 3, with the information reflecting the results of our second quarter and first half of 2024. Our team continues to focus on what matters in driving value in our business, focused on executing our plans reliably and responsibly, enhancing efficiencies, managing costs aggressively and building optionality value in our organic growth portfolio. During the second quarter, we generated strong margins and cash flows with $2.7 billion in EBITDA and $2 billion in operating cash flows. Our production volumes were largely in line with our estimates going into the period, but as we reported early July, our shipments of copper and gold were impacted in June as a result of obtaining export license in Indonesia, which has now been secured. I want to highlight two important items of significance and momentum for the future. The first item, Richard talked about it, it's the Indonesian smelter project advancing to the commissioning phase. As Richard discussed, our team has managed this large and complex project in an exemplary manner, and we're now focused on further derisking through a successful startup in the months ahead. Solid project execution is hallmark of our Freeport team who stepped up once again to deliver in a challenging environment for major capital projects. The successful completion of this strategic investment is of significance and positions us to secure a long-term extension of our operating rights in Indonesia. The second value driver I want to highlight is the ongoing momentum in our innovative leach project to build additional scale in low-cost incremental production. Continued scaling of this initiative is a major value driver and a differentiator for Freeport. As you'll see, our second quarter and first half incremental production from this initiative doubled from the comparable period since 2023. As we set our sights on scaling this initiative further, we see the opportunity to lower our unit costs in the U.S. meaningfully. We continue to execute our established shareholder return framework with $0.5 billion in dividends and share purchases year-to-date. We ended the quarter in a strong position financially, with a favorable future outlook as we head into the second half of this year. Turning to copper markets on Slide 4. Richard just talked about this, copper prices traded in a broad range between $3.67 per pound and $4.92 per pound on the LME exchange and a wider range on the U.S. COMEX exchange, that's been -- during 2024. We've discussed on prior calls, the impact of macro sentiment and investor positioning that can drive large moves in pricing. Richard referred to the domestic economic challenges in China, the ongoing weakness in the Chinese property market, destocking and working capital management and increase in copper exchange inventories and delays in actions to stimulate economic growth, which have all weighed on the market. In the U.S., we're seeing -- continuing to see strong demand for copper from a broad range of sectors. And globally, we favorable demand drivers for the future associated with copper's increasingly important role in the global economy. Copper is a foundational essential metal when it comes to electrification, and the world is becoming more and more focused on copper-intensive energy applications. The facts are its physical characteristics and superior conductivity make it the metal of electrification. New massive investment in the power grid, renewable generation, technology infrastructure and transportation are driving increased demand for copper and forecast call for above-trend growth and demand for the foreseeable future. As we review the fundamentals and match the demand side up with supply, we look at the limitations of existing supply growth, the challenges and extended time frames required to build new supplies and projections for peak mine supply over the next couple of years. These factors, combined with secular demand trends point to tight market conditions as we go forward. With Freeport's leading position in the industry, large-scale current operations and future growth pipeline, we're very well positioned to benefit from this fundamental outlook in the future. Now, turning to our operations on slide 5. We summarized the quarterly operating results by geographic region. In the US, we continue to focus our efforts on mitigating the impact of lower ore grade phases currently being mined. You'll see in our operational details provided in our press release that the ore grades processed through our mill and leach facilities in the US had more than a 10% decrease in ore grades compared to the year ago period. All else being equal, this results in higher costs on a per unit basis. We're very focused on mitigating these impacts, and to mitigate it, we're focused on initiatives to improve productivity, equipment reliability, take advantage of automation and new technologies and importantly, add low-cost incremental volumes through our innovative leach initiative, and we think this can have an impact as we go forward. In South America, our team and our large-scale Cerro Verde operation posted a solid second quarter. You can see the mill throughput exceeded 425,000 tons of ore per day. This is a strong recovery from the first quarter with higher throughput and recoveries contributed to higher copper and molybdenum volumes. Our unit net cash costs improved sequentially from the first quarter in South America, even after giving effect to a $0.22 per pound non-recurring charge for the new labor agreement reached during the quarter. In Indonesia, despite delays in shipping during the month of June, the results were strong, and you'll see net unit cash credits of $0.21 per pound. Our quarterly mill rates were lower than what we achieved in the first quarter as we advanced maintenance in June to manage inventory during the shipping delays. We also announced previously a change in mine sequencing that will affect gold volumes for the year. During the second quarter, we modified our mine plans for 2024 to address some disruption from certain wet draw points in the Grasberg Block Cave. We're currently maintaining our mining rates but have shifted to areas with slightly lower gold grades as we implement operating solutions to regain access to the higher-grade material. This is a timing matter and not a significant issue for our long-term plans. I want to talk some more about our innovative leach initiative, and we've got some information on slide 6. We're continuing to build momentum with this initiative. Given the low incremental cost and low capital intensity associated with these activities, which essentially involve recovering incremental copper from material that has already been mined. The returns and value proposition on this opportunity are significant and a major catalyst for us. You can see the significant growth in incremental volumes from these initiatives over the last several quarters. As a refresher, we have achieved our initial targeted run rate of 200 million pounds of copper per annum and now have our sights on scaling this to 400 million pounds per annum in the next couple of years. Ultimately, our goal is to achieve 800 million pounds per annum from this exciting initiative. This is the size of a major new mine with low capital investment required and incremental operating costs, which will greatly enhance the value and competitive position of our Americas production. I want to go over how we're doing this. The results to date have been achieved by enhancing heat retention in the leach stockpiles, by using data from sensors and analytics, which help us identify where the opportunities are located within these massive stockpiles and deploying new operational tactics to bring our catalyst solution to areas that were previously inaccessible. We're now building on these successful initiatives and have a high degree of confidence in boosting the run rate to 300 million pounds to 400 million pounds during 2026. Some examples of new initiatives include, expanding our surface area under leach by using drone technology and helicopters to install irrigations in areas previously inaccessible under conventional techniques and scaling our solution injection wells. With this experience, we're drilling more efficiently, getting more injection wells placed and are testing techniques to expand the impact of injection wells over broader areas. In parallel, we're working on innovation-driven initiatives, which would really move the needle to our ultimate objective of reaching 800 million pounds for annum. These include adding direct heat to the stockpiles from renewable or other sources, taking advantage of pyrite-hosted ore to generate additional heat and testing new additives that we've been developing. At Freeport, we're really well positioned to capture this value with an extensive inventory of substantial residual copper from material already mined, industry-leading technical expertise and leaching technology and a strong multi-disciplined and focused innovation team dedicated to this initiative. Turning to our other areas of growth of project pipeline on Slide 7. We discussed earlier the extended time frames required for the industry to develop new supplies. At Freeport, we have the advantage of leveraging existing infrastructure to develop new supplies and have a series of projects we are advancing. Our leach initiative is our best opportunity to grow in the near term, and we're pursuing this aggressively as we talked about. But beyond that, in the US, we have a brownfield expansion at our Bagdad mine in Arizona where we have an extensive reserve position. We've already reported. We've completed our studies. We're now advancing investments in automation, tailings and energy infrastructure and expanded employee housing in this remote location to position us to execute the project more efficiently when the time is right. This project, unlike other things that you see around the industry, it does not have major permitting hurdles and it represents a straightforward option. We're monitoring conditions and progress with our derisking initiatives and expect to be in a position to make a decision on our investment next year. We've also commenced pre-feasibility studies to define a brownfield expansion in the Lone Star, Safford District. Most of you know, this is our newest operation in the US and we're really just getting started here. We have our sights on more than doubling current production levels in the 300 million pounds per annum range. This is an enormous resource, and we expect this district will become a generational cornerstone asset for Freeport in Arizona in the next decade. At El Abra in Chile, where we are in partnership with CODELCO, we have completed pre-feasibility studies, and we're now preparing an environmental impact statement expected to be completed by the end of next year. The project involves \u2013 that we're considering, involves an investment in a new concentrator of scale similar to the size of Cerro Verde concentrator we installed nearly 10 years ago, investments in desalinization and a pipeline system to support our water requirements. The preliminary estimate for incremental capital costs for the new concentrator project and related infrastructure, which continue to be reviewed approximate $7.5 billion and would provide 750 million pounds of annual copper production and 9 million pounds of molybdenum per annum over a very long life. This project would require about seven to eight years of lead time because of permitting requirements, but we're advancing so we have optionality, and we're going to continue to review the economics in the context of market conditions, but believe this is a project that will be required in the future to support long-term copper demand trends. In Indonesia, we're making great progress on our large-scale Kucing Liar development scheduled to commence production prior to 2030. We're also conducting additional exploration below our Deep MLZ ore body and expect an extension of our operating lines beyond 2041 will set up for additional long-term exploration and development options in this highly-attractive district. We're advancing all these initiatives to build optionality for growth, and we'll continue to be disciplined in our approach, targeting opportunities that can be executed efficiently, profitably and value-enhancing. Richard talked about the PT-FI extension beyond 2041, and the key role that the smelter plays in that process. We've reviewed in the past our discussions with Indonesian government to extend our rights, to provide continuity of the significant benefits of this operation to the people of Papua and Republic of Indonesia. During the second quarter, the government enacted a regulation applicable to a broad range of license holders in Indonesia. We've highlighted the applicable provisions for IUPK license holders such as PT-FI, and these are the requirements for the conditions, which need to be met to \u2013 for approval for an extension. These conditions are in line with our expectations, and we're in the process of completing an application to be in a position to file the application during 2024. The previous requirement for extensions could only be requested five years before expiry. So these new regulations allow us to apply now, reflecting the government's recognition of the long lead times required for investment. It is a really positive development for PT-FI and its stakeholders. We look forward to making our application and be in a position to extend our rights so that we can continue our long-range planning and maximize the value of this great resource. Slide 9 shows our three-year outlook for sales volumes of copper, gold and molybdenum, made some modest changes to 2024 copper sales, reflecting small revisions in the US and Indonesia. And as previously discussed, our gold volumes for 2024 will now reflect the change in the mine sequencing, which we discussed earlier, and this is really timing in nature. The rest of the guidance is very similar to our previous outlook. For 2024, we currently estimate consolidated unit cash costs to approximate $1.63 per pound, slightly above the April estimate of $1.57 and similar to our guidance of $1.60 per pound at the start of the year. The details of this are presented in the back -- on Slide 20, in reference materials. Slide 10 shows the cash flow generating capacity of this business, putting together our projected volumes and cost projections. We show a modeled result for our EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $4 a pound to $5 per pound copper. With these model results for 2025 and 2026 and current volume and cost estimates, holding gold flat at $2,300 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $20 a pound, EBITDA on an annual basis would range from nearly $11 billion per annum at $4 copper to $15 billion per annum at $5 copper. And our operating cash flows under these price cases would range from $7.5 billion per year to $11 billion at $5 copper. And we show some sensitivities for your reference on the right of this chart. We've got long life reserves, large-scale production. We're really well-positioned to benefit from a better fundamental picture as we go forward. On Slide 11, we show as we have in the past, our current forecast for capital expenditures in 2024 and 2025 -- capital expenditures for 2024, our forecast of approximate $3.7 billion and $4.1 billion in 2025. It's a relatively small increase over two years and principally relates to revisions and estimates for our sustaining capital program and long-term projects in the Grasberg District. We're going to continue to be disciplined in deploying capital, really making sure that the capital we're deploying pays off and build initiatives to enhance value. The discretionary projects over this two-year period totaled $2.5 billion. This is the category that reflects the capital investments we're making in new projects that under our financial policy are funded with 50% of available cash that is not distributed. We've got some details in the back on Slide 23 in our reference materials that provide some more information about these projects, which are value-enhancing and it will help us as we look to build value in the future. On Slide 12, in conclusion, we reiterate the financial policy priorities centered on a strong balance sheet, cash returns to shareholders, and investments in value-enhancing growth projects. Our balance sheet is solid. We've got strong credit metrics and flexibility within our debt targets to execute on our strategy. During the quarter, our credit rating was upgraded by S&P and now we're investment-grade rating by all three major rating agencies. As indicated on the slide, we've distributed $4.3 billion to shareholders year-to-date through dividends and share purchases. We've got an attractive future long-term portfolio that allow us to continue to build value and follow-up policy of investing in projects that build long-term value and returning cash to shareholders. We actively monitor the market conditions and carefully manage the timing of our projects to make sure our financial flexibility remains strong. Our global team is driven by value. We're focused on our clear strategy to execute our plans, invest in our future and return cash to shareholders. And thank you for your attention, and we'll now take your questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alan Spence with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Alan Spence : Thank you all. Good morning. Kathleen Quirk : Good morning, Alan. Alan Spence : Good morning, Kathleen, Maree and Richard. On the North American operations, your grades were lower year-on-year. And the leaching volumes in Q2 annualizing above the 2024 target, yet copper sales guidance was decreased, I appreciate just by 1%. But do we put those together and conclude that North American kind of optimization targets are maybe proving a bit more challenging this year? Kathleen Quirk : Alan, we are really focused on productivity in North America. This is a big priority of our management team. During the second quarter, we made really good progress. We've got a series of metrics we're following that will drive the production higher. The one area that we're working on is we're continuing to have some unplanned maintenance, some disruptions caused by that. And really the asset health and reliability programs that we're putting in place and continue to build on, which has been a hallmark of our US operations are important to make sure that we meet our production targets. So I think we feel we're turning the corner. We've got very, very sharp focus on these things. The leach production is helping us to offset these impacts of low ore grades, and as I mentioned before, that's really going to help us bring down the average cost of our US production as we scale this further. But we've got to get these productivity objectives met. We're making progress on it. We had some issues in the quarter with some downtime in our mill and also some of our crush and convey facilities, but we're making progress to make sure our equipment is reliable and we don't have unplanned outages. And that's something we're really focused on as we go forward. Alan Spence : Thanks for that. And just a quick follow-up question on the leaching. You provided some helpful additional color on it. You mentioned a high probability of getting to the $300 million to $400 million range by 2026. But just to confirm, none of that would be in current 2026 sales volume guidance? Kathleen Quirk : Right. The -- we basically got our current rate that we're sustaining on the 200 million pounds per annum into our forecast. And so to the extent that we build on that scale and have a high confidence that we will, that is -- that provides some upside to our numbers. And what also provides upside is these productivity initiatives that I mentioned coming into play. So we know what to focus on. We've got teams working on it, and we're going to get there. But this leach thing will really help with the unit costs. Alan Spence : Understood. Thanks, Kathleen. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Carlos De Alba : Yeah. Thank you very much. Good morning, Kathleen and Richard. So Kathleen, just continue with the discussion on the leach projects and initiatives in North America. Can you remind us or give us some color as to how much lower cash cost does those initiatives or those volumes have relative to the North American and overall current cash cost? Kathleen Quirk : Yeah. So the incremental cost per pound for the leach initiatives or under $1 per pound incrementally. And the reason why they're lower is because the -- essentially, the mining cost has already been incurred. So this is ore that is in stockpiles where we're essentially recovering more metal than what our prior plans suggested we could do. And so we're identifying places within the stockpile where the rock has not gotten the benefit of this catalyst solution. And we've been able to identify these areas through our censoring and data analytics. And so now we're working on operational tactics to go after it. And so essentially, you don't have the mining cost because you've already incurred that. So this is all just incremental. And so that -- to the extent it scales, that has the benefit of bringing down the average unit cost in the US. And so it's something we're really, really focused on because it will change the competitive position of these US operations, principally our Morenci mine, which has most this potential. So we're really excited about it. We've got new technologies. We're bringing in some expertise from other industries, adjacent industries. It's helping us. We've got the agricultural industry that we've been taking the page from. We've got oil and gas industry, services industry that's helping us with some of these drilling techniques where we're drilling basically putting the solution. Usually, it's irrigated through, but over time, there's blockages, so we're now able to directly drill and put solution down into areas that aren't getting the benefit of the solution. And that's giving us a boost. We also call this other initiative, Leach Everywhere, and that's what I was referring to, where we're accessing areas that we couldn't get to before, and we're now able to get to them with drone technology helicopters where we can go places where humans couldn't go to lay these irrigation lines. So there's a lot happening here, a lot of excitement. We've got really major new mine potential here without big capital intensity and low incremental operating costs. So we're all over this one, Carlos. And -- but it does help us in terms of the incremental operating cost position of the US operations, the more we scale it. Carlos De Alba : Thanks, Kathleen. And maybe just another one, and I understand this might be difficult to answer precisely. But with the new regulation for IUPK in Indonesia in place, and basically, as you mentioned, PT-FI imposition or having met basically the requirements to apply for an extension. What is the path ahead to get the approval of extension? I don't know if there is anything on timing or milestones that you can point to, and is this something that we have to wait until the new President is sworn in? Kathleen Quirk : Well, the regulation was issued. We were waiting for a while the regulation to be finalized. And the regulation was issued in -- at the end of May. So that's a really positive development. And the catalyst really to put us in a position to be qualified as an integrated producer, which you have to be under this regulation to apply for a life of mine extension was the smelter. And so moving the smelter into commissioning and to the operational phase as we move into the next few months, really positions us to be able to apply. None of the conditions that are outlined in the regulation were surprises to us. It was in line with what we've been talking about with the government for some time now. We've got to actually put together the application package, which we're doing and we can apply now at any time. So we expect to apply to the license, there's not any guidelines for how long the government has to respond to that application. But the discussions we've had previously have been that the government wants to move forward with this quickly because they understand the long lead times, and they want to really see us get started on defining new resources and mine plans that allow us to have a continuity beyond 2041. So our objective is to get this done during 2024. I think that is really doable. And whether or not it's within this administration, the current administration is in place through October. I think there's large spread positive reaction to the smelter and to PT-FI being an integrated producer and to continuing the long-term benefits. And so whether it's this administration or the next, I think there's positive momentum for PT-FI to get this done during 2024. Carlos De Alba : Thank you. Richard Adkerson : And Kathleen, let me just add that this is different from what we had to face in the past. We're not debating on this. It's in everyone's best interest there's widespread acceptance for it. And there's a clear understanding now that shareholder -- all stakeholders benefit from us looking how to maximize the value of this resource. So it's -- for those of you who follow us in the past, this is a different process, and it's very positive. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Liam Fitzpatrick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Liam Fitzpatrick : Good morning everyone. Just a question around the new smelter in Indonesia and the ramp-up profile. On the face of it, it appears a fairly optimistic target to achieve full capacity by year-end, just given the size and the complexity of it. So can you give us some color on some of the key ramp-up milestones that you'll need to achieve through H2 to hit that target? And then separately, moving forward, do you plan to give us any separate disclosure for the smelter, so that we can assess the operating performance and the profitability so on? Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Liam, in terms of your first question, it is a very large complex project and smelter startups there aren't a lot of them on the scale in the Western world in recent years. And so we've recognized that for some time and have been planning for this over an extensive period of time. We've brought together the expertise that Freeport has around the world in operating smelters. We operate a smelter in the US, in Arizona. We have efficient smelter in Huelva, Spain, that we've operated for some time. We also have an existing smelter in Indonesia that we're in partnership with a Japanese partner there that has been very successful. So we've brought to bear all of the expertise in not only looking at construction, and we've had a team, a dedicated team on the construction side who have just done a great job. But on an operational side, we've been standing up this team for some time to be able to run the smelter and training people, we've had \u2013 we've already got the people employed. We've brought in expertise from around the world to lead startup. And so we've planned for it. And your point is well understood by the company. We feel we're well-prepared for it, with any start-up you're going to have issues. We recognize that. But every time we've thrown issues and challenges at this team through the construction period and into the commissioning period, we've been able to overcome them. I hope you have a chance, if you haven't already, to look at the video showing really where this \u2013 where the smelter is in terms of operational readiness, and we're showing all the various facilities as part of it. So we've planned for it. We understand it's going to be a different way of marketing our product. In the past, in Indonesia, we've loaded concentrate on a ship and pay the TC/RC and collected our revenue, and that was pretty simple. Now it's got a more a more complex logistics situation, and we've got a number of products we'll be marketing. But the team has been working on this, and we've got expertise in operating smelters and marketing various products. And so we're well situated for it. In terms of the reporting, it will be reported. It's integrated into PT-FI. It will be reported as part of PT-FI's results, you'll be able to see its operating costs through the TC and RC line on our unit cost. But above that line in the revenue line, of course, we're going to be able to generate higher revenues because we're marketing directly. We have the -- essentially the free metal that will come through to our benefit. We don't have to pay a smelter, the payable factors, et cetera. So, it will be a piece of revenues and a piece of operating costs, but we'll provide disclosures to help you through that. We won't have the duties any longer. And so that's a sizable benefit as well. for our results. But just in terms of the operations and readiness, I'm going to ask Cory Stevens make a couple of comments. Cory is -- he Heads up our Engineering Group, our Project Construction Group, our group that deals with operational efficiencies. So, he's got a big portfolio, not only leading the smelter project, but also the leach innovation initiative. But Cory is just back from Indonesia and maybe, Cory, you can just supplement what I was talking about in terms of the readiness for operations. Cory Stevens : Yes. Thanks Kathleen. Yes. So, the commissioning work is well underway. It's a number of giant unit processes and the teams are collaborating between operations and Kathleen mentioned it, but we've got a large contingent of operating folks from around the world, we're calling boots on the ground, and they're all out there together working side-by-side to commission this large project. I mean, it's pretty -- it's immense. And just to give you an idea, I mean, there's 45,000 pieces of instrumentation and computer connections that we're verifying and double checking and running the equipment through the operating ranges to be able to start up. And the ramp-up plan, when we go to start this up, I mean the plant wasn't designed to run very slow. So, you end up having to run it at essentially 50% capacity or a little bit better than that right from the start. And so there's a lot of checks and safety checks going on right now to be able operate at that level and then double check the procedures so forth and then we'll be able to ramp up from there. So, team's energized, it's well choreographed and has been planned for years, and we're ready to make it happen. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. And I just want to emphasize one thing at Freeport, when we do a major project, we benefit from having a centralized team that supports operating teams. And so unlike some other companies that don't have this kind of infrastructure that can really help manage the construction period and transition to operations, we really can bring together the best of the best when it comes to executing a start-up. And I'm not sugarcoating, we're going to have things that come up, we know that, but we really have the right people that -- in place to have a safe and efficient start-up. We expect in August that we'll get first processing of concentrate through the facility. And as Cory said, the ramp up we expect to move pretty quickly to go through the end of 2025 -- I mean 2024, we're also -- we got a precious metal refinery that will be starting up in the same timeframe. in the revenue line, of course, we're going to be able to generate higher revenues because we're marketing directly. We have the -- essentially the free metal that will come through to our benefit. We don't have to pay a smelter, the payable factors, et cetera. So, it will be a piece of revenues and a piece of operating costs, but we'll provide disclosures to help you through that. We won't have the duties any longer. And so that's a sizable benefit as well. for our results. But just in terms of the operations and readiness, I'm going to ask Cory Stevens make a couple of comments. Cory is -- he Heads up our Engineering Group, our Project Construction Group, our group that deals with operational efficiencies. So, he's got a big portfolio, not only leading the smelter project, but also the leach innovation initiative. But Cory is just back from Indonesia and maybe, Cory, you can just supplement what I was talking about in terms of the readiness for operations. Cory Stevens : Yes. Thanks Kathleen. Yes. So, the commissioning work is well underway. It's a number of giant unit processes and the teams are collaborating between operations and Kathleen mentioned it, but we've got a large contingent of operating folks from around the world, we're calling boots on the ground, and they're all out there together working side-by-side to commission this large project.

So, team's energized, it's well choreographed and has been planned for years, and we're ready to make it happen. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. And I just want to emphasize one thing at Freeport, when we do a major project, we benefit from having a centralized team that supports operating teams.

And as Cory said, the ramp up we expect to move pretty quickly to go through the end of 2025 -- I mean 2024, we're also -- we got a precious metal refinery that will be starting up in the same time frame. So a lot has gone into this project, a lot of planning. And it's been executed well, and we expect that we'll continue to execute it well through the ramp-up. Liam Fitzpatrick : That was a very comprehensive answer. So thank you both. Could I just ask a quick follow-up? Is there one item along the critical path over the next few months that you'd highlight that once you get through that, you'll be sleeping a bit easier at night? Kathleen Quirk : Cory, you have one on your mind? Cory Stevens : Yes. So we're taking extra precautions on the second stage of the smelting furnace, the flash converting furnace, there's only six of these running in the world. It's fairly specialized and we're taking extra precautions there. That is at the heart of what's going to enable the smelter to operate at the levels that we want to. Liam Fitzpatrick : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Bob Brackett : Good morning. A question around the gold sales revision. I understand the wet conditions in the Block Cave changed your mine sequencing into maybe a lower gold grade area, but why doesn't those ounces come back in the plan period? So if you lost 0.2 million ounces this year, wouldn't you argue that it should reappear in 2025 or 2026? Kathleen Quirk : Yes, it's 150,000 ounces, Bob, and it comes back into our plan over the next few years. And so it just didn't -- it didn't round enough to up our numbers, but it is purely a timing situation. And when we look at the \u2013 our overall 5-year plan, it really it didn't change much. Mark Johnson is on the call, the issue we had in the second quarter, and we expect will continue for a period 2024 is we had some wet draw points that had spillage that we couldn't get back in to clean up. It took -- takes a while to clean it up. We've got a robust remote mining, underground mining system, and that's working really well. And what the team is working on is a remote pumping system that allows us to clean up these spills more quickly, and so we don't have as much disruption in these areas. But it really is just a timing thing. And Mark, I don't know if there's anything you want to add to those comments? Mark Johnson : No, Kathleen, I think you touched on it. We've been managing wet muck going back to the IOZ, so roughly over 20 years. Some of the things, as you mentioned, we had some spills that traveled a bit further. So that in the GBC, there's some unique material characteristics that we're mitigating. And the primary one, as Kathleen mentioned, is the ability to remotely place pumping equipment and pump out the water that accumulates during some of our time entry criteria. So what we have is a period of time that we wait to get safely back in, what we're seeing is that the water builds up during that period of waiting. By getting the remote pumping in, we'll be able to have it pump before the -- while this time is taking place and then we can start our cleanup much quicker. One of the things that we did in GBC is -- that was a bit unique, we -- because it's the foundation of our operation and the primary source of value, we built in the additional operational flexibility by developing more draw points than theoretically required to meet the production rate. And that's what allowed us to shift to this other area that had very similar copper grades, but incrementally lower gold grades. And as Kathleen mentioned, over the five years, that that goal you had mentioned is back in the plan. And we plan to have this mitigation measure strongly in place, firmly in place in the fourth quarter, and I'm confident we can do that. Bob Brackett : Great. That's very clear. A quick follow-up on sort of the third condition around the IUPK application is commitment for additional exploration and increases in refining capacity, is that a hard dollar amount that you have to put into the application? Or is that something that you've discussed? Or is that a softer sort of target? Kathleen Quirk : That's something that would be approved by the by the Minister of Energy & Minerals. We've been talking with the government. We do have plans to conduct exploration and we're doing some of that now. In the future, we'll conduct additional exploration that will allow us to identify additional resources. And so that is -- it's really part of our plan for extension. In terms of the additional refining capacity, there's been discussion with the government. There is an aspiration to have additional capacity in Papua. Our current smelter is located in Gresik, and there's an aspiration to have additional capacity in Papua, and that continues to be discussed with the government. But there's not a -- the regulation doesn't have a specific number or level of investment. It really is a matter of looking at what's needed in country and the desire is to have it located in Papua, and we'll be working to evaluate that along with the government. Bob Brackett : Very clear. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Orest Wowkodaw : Hi. Good morning. Just a clarification on the potential IUPK extension. The -- it sounds like you're moving towards giving up an extra 10% in the asset post 2041, would you receive any proceeds for that? Or is that effectively just the cost of the extension? Kathleen Quirk : The 10%, offering a 10% interest to a state-owned company, and we're talking with MIND ID about their objective to acquire additional 10%. The discussions we've had to date with the government have involved offering that 10%, and this is coming from FCX's shares, offering that 10% at -- with a reimbursement of our capital costs incurred for the current period through 2041 to the extent that, that benefits the period beyond 2041. So it's essentially a book value concept. And the rationale for offering the 10% and the mechanism for valuing it has been that the government is granting PT-FI with the extension and it's a cost of the deal. And from our perspective, being able to extend beyond 2041, there's a lot of value there that if we don't move forward and make investments that we won't be able to accomplish. So we felt it in the spirit of the partnership we have with the government where it's a one-off alignment and a win-win that this was an appropriate to give us the optionality to have value significant value beyond 2041. Orest Wowkodaw : Okay. Thank you. And just as a quick follow-up, it's nice to see the buyback resume here in July. It's been two years, I think, since we've seen any share repurchase. Should we expect that now to ramp up in the second half of the year with the smelter commissioning and ramp-up? Kathleen Quirk : The financial policy is basically one where we distribute through dividends and share purchases, available cash, 50% of available cash. The smelter investments were not part of that math. So we're financing the separately. So the available cash definition is really just the flow and less the CapEx that's required for the current operation. It doesn't include the smelter. It doesn't include our future growth that we're investing in the discretionary projects that we've labeled earlier. So that will be a function of what our cash flows are. We certainly want to continue buying back stock, but it will be a function of what ultimate cash flows, and we'll continue to follow that policy. Orest Wowkodaw : Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Just as a reminder, we're moving past the hour here, and I know people have been asking more than one question, so please limit to one and we'll get back to you with follow-ups. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Michael Dudas with VRP. Please go ahead. Kathleen Quirk : Hi, Mike. Michael Dudas : David and Richard. Richard Adkerson : Hey, Mike. Kathleen Quirk : Mike, I think your line is cutting out. Michael Dudas : Can you hear me now? Kathleen Quirk : I can hear you now. Michael Dudas : Thank you. Your relationship and negotiations with the Indonesian government has been going quite well as you portrayed here today and in past calls. Maybe you can update us on how things are in Peru, Chile, maybe even in North America, how -- relative to the amount of investments that you're going to be looking at, maybe others and your competitors as well, how that's played out given the volatility and the upside in the copper price and any thought from those governments and those ministers to move along with the needed supplies that the market seems to be calling for? Kathleen Quirk : I think in South America, there's a strong desire to see more investment certainly Peru and Chile, both, want to see more investment in mining is such a big part of their economy. So they are very, very interested. Now you've got to make sure you've got the community and social matters done in the right way, but there is a strong desire for those to make investments. Chile is going through a process now of looking at its permitting and trying to streamline permitting. We talked about El Abra project going through a long permitting process, and we're hopeful that this process that the government is now undertaking will allow a streamlining of permits. But I think both countries want to see more investment in mining. The US as well, you've seen that in recent times with the US prioritizing metals that are critical to the supply chain. And so I think the environment for -- in these countries for making investments is more positive than it has been in the past. But again, I want to emphasize the social aspect of this and the community aspect. It doesn't mean that, that lowers the bar and what our responsibilities are to sustainability into communities and environmental management and social good. So you've got to tick all the boxes, but there is a growing recognition of a need for these metals, and copper is one of the leads for that. So we are in a good position. We're in a particularly good position in the US with our current operations where \u2013 what we're talking about doing is building on existing operations. And so the permitting requirements are not as extensive for types of projects we're pursuing as they would be for a greenfield project or project in Chile, for example. And US is also talking about streamlining, permitting and regulatory. So we're in a good position, the Lone Star, Safford opportunity that I talked about earlier is one that even though our studies are a little behind where we are in Chile with El Abra, that project will catch up pretty quickly because we don't have the extensive permitting requirements to do that project that we have in Chile. So we're very focused on getting that project defined, so we can look at them together and see, which one is -- drives the most value for our business and shareholders. And so we really have an advantage in the US with the existing operations and leveraging our current position. Of course, the leaching doesn't require new permits. So we're in a good position to bring on projects more quickly than maybe others could. Richard Adkerson : Years of commitment to doing what Kathleen just said of doing the right thing, building relationships have led us in the US to have uniform support from communities, from native American groups, from state governments and regulators. The same goes true in Peru for our Cerro Verde project in the Arequipa region where Peru can be very challenging. It's got very challenging politics right now, but we benefit from work we've done to support the community and that's very helpful. And then in Chile, we're \u2013 our 49% partner at El Abra is CODELCO, and they are very anxious for us to move forward and very supportive. We developed a relationship with [indiscernible] will be on a panel with him at APAC and Peru this fall. And the tone has significantly changed from his initial election period where he's met the realities of the need for Chile to help support the mining sector. This is always such a big important part of our business, as you can see around the world. We learned a lot of lessons early on with the development of Grasberg and the need to have good relationships with indigenous people there as well as with central government. So, I'm proud of what our team has done, and we're just committed to finding common ground and doing things in the right way. Michael Dudas : Very helpful Richard and Kathleen. Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lawson Winder with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. Lawson Winder : Operator, thank you very much and Kathleen and Richard, hello and thank you for making the time for my call -- my question. I'll just keep it brief. I wanted to ask about Kucing Liar, hugely high-return project for you all. Effectively one topic, three questions. I just wanted to get an update on when you were expecting first production and then ask as to the pace of spending? So, I mean it's a $4 billion project, and you're noting that about $400 million have been spent to date over a period of about two years. When do you expect that to start to pick up a little more? Thanks very, very much. Kathleen Quirk : Lawson, you're right. It's like our other projects, long-term development, Grasberg underground blockade, the capital is spent over a multiyear period. And we do, in our projections, show that we'll start ramping up spending in Kucing Liar as we go forward. The average of $400 million a year over a 10-year period was -- we're spending a little bit lower than that, and that will begin to ramp up and we'll have some years where it's higher than $400 million. And there may be additional development in that $4 billion that will occur after we start. So, -- but we are expecting a start-up KL towards the end of this decade in advance of 2030. And it is a very large scale, 90,000 tons a day of ore, significant copper and gold production from that deposit. A real benefit of this extension beyond 2041, is the resource is much larger than what we'll mine between late 20s, late 2020s and in 2041. So, we'll have -- we did the economics and the economics paid at just the life that ends in 2041. But there's a lot of resource beyond that, that will come in the fold with an extension. So, it's a great extension of Grasberg. It's in that district. We're leveraging everything that we've learned from developing the Grasberg Block Cave and Deep MLZ, and prior to that, our other ore bodies, but it's basically the same kind of development that we've had in the past, and we're using all the new learnings and technologies that have benefited us in the development of Grasberg Block Cave. So, we're in a good place there and feel good about our execution of this project over the next several years, leading into 2030, where we'll have good production coming from this operation. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Kathleen Quirk : Hey, Brian. Brian MacArthur : Good morning, Rick. Good morning, Rick and Kathleen. Thank you for taking my question. I just want to go back to this 10% on the IUPK. I just want to confirm, A, until 2041 you maintain your 48.76%. I think that's what I understand is that it's 10% thereafter. But then two, on the capital, do you put it all in for 2041 and then get it back? Or is this going to be more like for a while at Rio, where as you develop reserves and their ownership goes up, that you share the cap in different ratios like we saw that said, with the Rio Tinto stuff historically. I'm just trying to figure out exactly like how the cash flows are going to work on this. Kathleen Quirk : Yes. Well, as part of the application to the government for the extension, we will submit an agreement to make the transaction. And that agreement is currently being discussed with MIND ID. The -- what's been discussed over the last couple of years with respect to this, or the last year plus, is the way it will work is the 10% share transfer will take place in 2041. And the price paid at that point will be a reimbursement of the capital that was incurred between now and 2041 that benefits the period beyond 2021. So to the extent, it's not like the Rio Tinto deal at all. It's basically just a reimbursement at book value of what's there to benefit the period beyond 2041. So essentially, look at the at the book value end of 2041 and that pro rata percentage, 10% of our shares will be transferred and that will be the purchase price will be the reimbursement of capital. So the cash flows between now and 2041 won't be impacted by it. Richard Adkerson : And Brian, that transaction occurs after 2041. It's not like the Rio deal where the transaction occurred in the mid-90s, and it was just a question of how it was applied. So if for whatever reason it doesn't occur, then our interest will stay the same. It's anticipated the government would act to acquire that 10%, and that would be the agreement on the cost reimbursement, we get triggered when that transaction occurs. Brian MacArthur : All right. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Bill Peterson : Hi, Kathleen and team. Thanks for taking the question. Nice to see the doubling of the leaching in the first half 2024 relative to the first half last year. Looking ahead, how should we think about the trajectory from here? Do you expect to be at a similar output as the recent quarter, 55 million pounds or some of the productivity items you highlighted, such as using technology, you see further upside in the back half of the year and into 2025 as you progress to the 300 million to 400 million pounds per year target in 2026? Kathleen Quirk : The current run rate is what's in our numbers. We do see opportunities to build on it through these initiatives that we're pursuing to move up to this 300 million to 400 million pound per annum range. And so it will come over time. It's not going to come in all at once. And so as we go through this year and next year, we'll probably have more than what we've currently got in our plans. But we haven't put forward. We're still deploying these tactics, we feel very confident about them, but we haven't put those into our numbers at this stage, and that will be something that we'll continue to update as we go forward. Bill Peterson : Thank you. Operator : With that, I'll turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, Regina, and thank you, everyone, for your interest and participation. And if you have any follow-ups, feel free to contact David. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Joint, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. David Joint : Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the Freeport conference call. Earlier this morning, Freeport reported its third quarter 2024 operating and financial results. A copy of today's press release with supplemental schedules and slides is available on our Web site, fcx.com. Today's conference call is being broadcast live on the Internet. Anyone may listen to the conference call by accessing our Web site homepage and clicking on the webcast link. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call. A replay of the webcast will be available on our Web site later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include non-GAAP measures and forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our cautionary language included in our press release and slides and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings, all of which are available on our Web site. Also on the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, Chairman of the Board; Kathleen Quirk, President and Chief Executive Officer; Maree Robertson, Executive Vice President and CFO, and other senior members of our management team. Richard will make some opening remarks, Kathleen will review our slide materials, and then we'll open up the call for questions. Richard? Richard Adkerson : Thanks, David. Thanks everyone for joining us. It was a solid quarter as you can see and that's the result of the good work that our global Freeport team has accomplished and really proud of them and look forward to the future. We've got great outlook for our company, great outlook long term for our copper and commodity that we base our strategy on. So Kathleen will review with you the results of the quarter and talk about it, and we're making progress with this fire we had at our new smelter in Indonesia and we'll review that as well. We have a new president in Indonesia, Prabowo Subianto. When Prabowo was General three decades ago, we worked together closely on issues affecting our operations in Papua. He knows our business. He's appointed cabinet, which includes a number of cabinet members from Joko Widodo\u2019s cabinet and other people that we've known over the years. We look forward to working with him and believe his understanding of our business and of our location in Papua will be a big benefit as we work with this administration going forward. Kathleen, I'll turn the call over to you to review our results and our outlook. Kathleen Quirk : Okay, great. Thank you, Richard. And I'm going to start on our slide presentation, starting on Slide 3 with our highlights for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024. Our team continues to deliver on our operating plans and pursue value through enhancing efficiencies, managing costs aggressively and building value in our organic growth portfolio. You'll see here we generated strong margins and cash flows during the quarter with $2.7 billion in EBITDA and $1.9 billion in operating cash flows. Our operating performance was supported by sales volumes exceeding guidance for both copper and gold and favorable unit cash cost performance compared to both our guidance and the year ago quarter. We're focused on initiatives to build value from organic growth. At Freeport, we benefit from a large reserve and resource position with near term, medium term and longer term embedded growth options. The high potential innovative leach technologies are delivering results and we've several ongoing initiatives to add scale and low cost copper volumes in our Americas business. In the first nine months of 2024, the incremental copper production from our leach initiative was nearly 70% higher than the comparable period last year, and we have additional projects underway to build scale and improve on our US cost position. We're also advancing our brownfield expansion opportunities position the business for long term growth to supply a market with increased requirements for copper. During the third quarter, we purchased 5.3 million shares of Cerro Verde in at market transactions on the Peruvian Stock Exchange at a cost of $210 million and that allowed us to increase our ownership in this highly attractive asset from the prior level of 53.6% to 55%. The public flow of Cerro verde now represents about 4.3% of the outstanding shares. We ended the quarter in a strong position financially. And as we look forward, we're very optimistic about the markets we serve, our portfolio of high quality copper assets and the future prospects for strong cash flow generation to support investments and value enhancing projects and returns to shareholders. We'll talk about markets on Slide 4. Copper prices again during the third quarter traded in a broad range. On the LME, they range between 3.91 and 4.47 per pound. And on the COMEX exchange range from 3.94 per pound to 4.66 per pound. The settlement prices on the LME for the quarter averaged $4.18 per pound. As we look at the quarter and where prices traded, they largely followed macro sentiment, which weighed global economic data and economic pressures in China against actions by the Fed and other central banks to cut interest rates and the potential for large economic stimulus in China. At the micro level, we continue to see secular demand trends associated with electrification, providing strong demand for copper and offsetting the impact of a cyclical slowdown. In the US, our customers continue to report strong demand for power cable and building wire associated with substantial investment in electrical infrastructure and AI data centers. This growing sector more than offset weakness in traditional demand sectors in residential construction and autos. Demand from China continues to be supported by significant investments in the electrical grid and continued growth in China's production of electric vehicles. Notably, China's demand for copper continues to grow despite a weak property sector. Recent announcements for economic stimulus in China to support the country's economic growth targets could provide further support for metals demand as we move through 2024 and into 2025. As we've discussed in the past, Copper is a foundational metal and a key component of electrification. It's physical characteristics and superior connectivity make it essential to electrification. New massive investment in the power grid, renewable generation, technology infrastructure and transportation are driving increased demand for copper and forecast call for above trend growth and demand for the foreseeable future. As we look at these fundamentals of demand and match it up with supply, we continue to see a tightly balanced market in the near term and deficit conditions longer run. This is going to require new investments and innovative technologies to build supplies longer term and at Freeport, we\u2019ve driven supply of copper reliably and responsibly to a growing market. With our leading industry position, our large scale current operations and our future growth pipeline, we're well positioned to benefit from this fundamental outlook for copper. I remind everyone that in addition to copper, we're also a major gold producer and are benefiting from increasing gold prices. We'll turn to operations on Slide 5, where we summarize the quarterly operating results by geographic region. In the US, we are continuing to take actions to improve efficiencies and cost performance to mitigate the impact of lower grades. We have more work to do but recent trends are improving. We're closely monitoring key performance indicators and seeing positive trends in recent months in asset efficiency associated with key areas of loading, hauling, crushing and stacking. Our equipment reliability is a focus area and we're making strides in reducing unplanned downtime. We're also rationalizing the use of contractors to reduce costs and allocating internal resources to our key focus areas. In addition, success in our leaching initiative and further scaling incremental low cost production will also drive reductions in our cost structure. In South America, the team at the Cerro Verde operation posted another solid quarter. Mill throughput exceeded 420,000 metric tons of ore per day during the quarter and our mill recovery improved from last year's third quarter. Our unit net cash costs were slightly less than last year's third quarter after excluding the $0.12 per pound nonrecurring charge in the quarter for a new labor agreement. After reaching agreement with Cerro Verde's second union, we now have multiyear labor agreements covering Cerro Verde's hourly workforce. Mentioned earlier we purchased additional Cerro Verde shares that gives us more exposure to this established long lived and high quality assets. In Indonesia, results were quite strong and that's evidenced by a unit net cash credit of $0.71 per pound. The team is consistently delivering strong volumes of both copper and gold from our large scale underground ore bodies. Our sales in the quarter were higher than our estimates going into the period with increased mill rates and oil grades. We also benefited from strong gold sales in the quarter, reflecting good production performance and a reduction in inventory from June 30th levels. Our near term focus areas include continued strong execution of our operating plans, commissioning of a value driven copper cleaning circuit at our site in Papua to support strong mill recoveries and commissioning the precious metals refinery. We're also working to restore smelter operations following the recent smelter fire event, which we'll talk about more on the next slide. Just an update on where we are with the smelter. We made good progress during the third quarter on our commissioning and start-up. This is a project that our team managed construction in a challenging market in a very effective manner. But we did experience a setback last week on October 14th from a fire incident in a gas cleaning facility used in the sulfuric acid production process. Our safety protocols were effective and the fire was extinguished in a short period of time without injury to our personnel. Start-up activities have been temporarily suspended as a result while we conduct damage and root cause assessments and develop our recovery plans. We've presented a picture on the slide that you can review. But as you can see, the incident affected a relatively small area of the overall project. We have teams actively engaged in planning the repairs and assessing lead times for replacement equipment. We expect that the repair cost will be covered by our insurance programs and we're also working with the Indonesian government on continuity of concentrate exports during the outage. Our mining operations in Papua have not been impacted and our team is focused on restoring smelter operations safely and expeditiously. We look forward to achieving our objective of being a fully integrated producer in Indonesia, which positions us to secure a long term extension of our operating rights there. Really continue to be very excited about our innovative leach initiative. On Slide 7, you can see that early results continue to indicate significant value potential. Just a reminder, we achieved our initial targeted run rate of 200 million pounds per annum of copper per annum at the end of last year and are now driving initiatives to scale this initiative to 300 million to 400 million pounds per annum in the next couple of years. Ultimately, our goal was to achieve 800 million pounds per annum from this value enhancing growth initiative. This is the size of a major new mine with low capital investment required, low incremental operating costs and that will significantly enhance the value and competitive position of our Americas production. You can see on the slide, the significant growth in incremental volumes from these initiatives over the last several quarters, our results have been achieved by enhancing heat retention in the leach stockpiles using data from sensors and analytics to identify targets and through deploying new operational tactics to direct solution injection to areas that were previously inaccessible. We continue to build confidence in boosting the run rate to 300 million to 400 million pounds per year during 2026. Some of the examples of the initiatives that are now underway that will add volumes in the future include expanding our surface area under leach by using helicopters to install irrigation in areas previously inaccessible under conventional techniques and by scaling our targeted solution injection wells. We're making great progress on our leach injection technology, great progress on our drilling. We're drilling much more efficiently and we're able to increase the rate of well development. In parallel, we're also advancing innovation driven initiatives which would support our ultimate objective of reaching 800 million pounds per annum. We believe there's significant opportunity from increasing heat to the stockpiles. We're looking at adding heat to the leach solution using external energy or using pyrite hosted ores to generate additional heat. Heat is a proven source to improve recoveries in this type of application. We're also continuing to advance testing of new additives at scale and we look forward to reporting to you on our progress on these initiatives. At Freeport, we're really well positioned to capture the value of this opportunity with an extensive inventory of substantial residual copper from material already mined, an industry leading technical team with expertise in leaching technology and a strong multi-disciplined innovation team dedicated to this initiative. We've got additional opportunities for growth beyond the leach opportunity, and you can see that on Slide 8, where we list our organic growth projects. All of these projects are brownfield opportunities where we're leveraging existing assets and established operations. The leach initiative that we just talked about is our best opportunity to grow in the near term and we're pursuing this initiative very aggressively. In the US, we also have opportunities for expansion at our Bagdad and Safford Lone Star operations. And at Bagdad, we're advancing investments in automation, tailings and energy infrastructure and expanded employee housing in this remote location to position us to execute the project more efficiently when the time is right. We don't have major permitting hurdles and this is really a straightforward option. We're monitoring conditions and progress with our derisking initiatives and continue to expect to be in a position to make a decision next year on the expansion plans. In the Safford Lone Star District where we have a very large resource, we're engaged in studies to define a brownfield expansion. We're targeting opportunities to more than double current production levels, which are currently around 300 million pounds per annum. The large resource that we have at this location, it gives us an opportunity for Safford Lone Star to become a generational cornerstone asset for Freeport and Arizona in the next decade. At El Abra in Chile, this is our partnership with Codelco, as we previously reported, we completed pre-feasibility studies and we're in the process of preparing an environmental impact statement which we expect to be completed by the end of next year. The project involves investment in a new concentrator of scale similar to the size of Cerro Verde that we installed nearly 10 years ago, investments in the desalinization and pipeline system to support our water requirements. This project is large. It would provide 750 million pounds of annual copper production and 9 million pounds of annual molybdenum production. It's a long lead project. It would require something on the order of seven to eight years because of the time frame for permitting in Chile. And we're going to continue to review economics in the context of market conditions but we believe this is a project that will be required in the future to support long term copper demand trends, and this is a project in our portfolio that Freeport can execute. In Indonesia, we continue to progress our large scale Kucing Liar development. This is a very large ore body adjacent to our existing operations, our existing ore bodies in Papua. We expect to commence production by 2030. We're also conducting exploration below our Deep MLZ ore body. We're getting encouraging results. We expect that an extension of our operating rights in Indonesia beyond 2041 will set us up for additional long term development options in this highly attractive district. By pursuing all of these initiatives and advancing them, we're really focused on building optionality for future growth. We're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach and focused on targeting opportunities that can be executed over time that enhance long term value. Our Slide 9 shows our three year outlook, which we show every quarter and keep updated. This is the outlook for sales of copper, gold and molybdenum and that you'll see the sales guidance is very similar to our previous outlook. We also have updated our estimates for our unit net cash cost. We expect our average for 2024 to approximate $1.58 per pound. That is below our July estimate of $1.63 per pound and similar to our guidance at the start of the year of $1.60 per pound. We've got some details of this information by region on Slide 19 and the reference materials. So as we move to cash flows, margins and cash flows and putting together our projected volumes and cost projections on Slide 9 -- Slide 10, we show modeled results for EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $4 to $5 per pound. These are modeled results using the average of 2025 and 2026 with our current volume projections and cost estimates and holding gold flat at $2,600 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $20 per pound. You'll see here that annual EBITDA at $4 copper would range from $11 billion and it would go to approximately $15 billion per annum at $5 copper. Our operating cash flows at these product ranges would be over $7 billion at $4 copper to $10.5 billion at $5 copper. We've got sensitivities that we've presented on the right of this chart. You'll note that we're highly leveraged to copper price with each $0.10 per pound equating to about $420 million in annual EBITDA. We're also leveraged to gold and will benefit from improving gold prices with each $100 change in gold prices approximating $150 million in annual EBITDA. With long live reserves, large scale production, Freeport is well positioned to generate substantial cash flow to fund future organic growth and cash returns under our performance based payout framework. Moving to the next slide, on Slide 11, we're showing our current forecast for capital expenditures for this year and next. Capital expenditures for 2024 are forecast at about $3.6 billion and we estimate capital expenditures for next year to total about $4.2 billion. You'll see there have been some timing shifts between the two years but over the two years the changes are not material. We'll note that the discretionary projects over this two year period totaled $2.5 billion. This is a category that reflects the capital investments we're making in new projects that under our financial policy are funded with the 50% of available cash that's not distributed. They're value enhancing projects, growth projects, provide good returns and they're detailed on Slide 23 in our reference materials. As we look forward, we're going to continue to be disciplined in deploying capital and really focused on those opportunities that build value in our business. And finally, on Slide 12, we reiterate the financial policy priorities centered on a strong balance sheet, cash returns to shareholders and investments in value enhancing growth projects. We've got a very solid balance sheet, investment grade ratings from all three agencies, strong credit metrics and flexibility within our debt targets to execute on projects. We've distributed $4.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases since implementing this framework, got a very attractive future long term portfolio that will enable us to continue to build value for shareholders. Our global team is very focused on driving value. We're committed to strong execution of our plans, providing cash to invest in profitable growth and returns to shareholders. Thanks for everyone for your attention. And now I would like to open the call to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Chris LaFemina : Just wanted to ask a couple of questions about Indonesia. And first, on smelter fire with the insurance. Kathleen, you mentioned that the insurance would cover the costs for repairs. What if there is a situation where there's a delay to being able to export concentrate? Do you have any business interruption insurance that might cover the cost of loss shipments or any insurance that might cover the incremental royalties that you had have to pay on concentrate on exports? Kathleen Quirk : The policy that we're referring to is a construction insurance policy that does not have business interruption coverage. It does cover the cost of the repairs. This is not a -- as you can see from the picture, it's not a big area of the affected facilities, it is an essential area. The process is essential to the overall production of copper, refining of copper, but it's not a large part of the overall facility. So our focus, Chris, really is getting the repairs done as quickly as possible. We do have discussions with the government. It's in everyone's interest that the concentrate continue. We do have some flexibility within our existing quota of what we can ship through 2024 but we'll be asking for additional flexibility to make sure that we can we can ship everything that we produce in 2024. And then depending on the time frame that it takes to restore operations, we'll work with the governments for continuity in the portion of 2025 that will be affected, it's in everyone's interest. As you run through the math, the government gets essentially through taxes and royalties and dividends over 70% of the economics or the cash flow. So it will be in everyone's interest for this to continue and we'll work hard to get this operation restored as quickly as possible. But in the interim, we expect that we'll continue to be able to export. Chris LaFemina : And then just secondly, on Indonesia as well. So the $1 billion of restricted cash, which I think is what 30% of the export proceeds and it's held for 90 days in Indonesian banks. Does that restricted cash policy continue even after the smelter ramps up? And can you just remind us of kind of the background behind that and what the reason for that cash restriction is? Kathleen Quirk : Chris, it refers to all exports. So it doesn't just affect copper, it affects all exports in Indonesia required to hold in bank accounts for 90 days, temporarily your export proceeds. And it was a measure taken last year by the government to look at its currency and fiscal situation. And so it don't -- not only applies to us but implies the oil companies and other people that are exporting. So that will continue unless the regulation has changed that will continue beyond 2020 -- beyond the smelter startup. But it is there. We're earning returns on the investments. It's there temporarily. We withdraw it after 90 days. And so right now, it's just held in deposit. But that's something that the government will continue to consider in light of its objectives. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Liam Fitzpatrick with Deutsche Bank. Liam Fitzpatrick : A couple more on the smelter, I'm afraid. Firstly, I appreciate you're still assessing the situation. But can you give some high level guidance on the length of delay that we're talking about, is it three months, could it be substantially longer than that? And then in terms of the government reaction, do you think -- and the export extension, do you think this will be just a formality and received in good time or could there be a risk that it could be delayed beyond the year end? And then a quick one just separate to the smelter on the Cerro Verde stake increase, it's small but probably the best type of M&A that you can do. Is this a one-off or do you think there could be more opportunities to increase your stake? Kathleen Quirk : On the time frame for the repairs, we don't have that information yet. This is a event that happened essentially a week ago and our teams have been on the ground inspecting the damaged equipment, determining what needs to be replaced, what does not need to be replaced. And we're working in parallel with our vendors on understanding lead times for various equipment. The early results in terms of the area affected, not everything on the structure was damaged. We were fortunate we did not have big impacts to structural steel. There will be some equipment and piping that needs to be replaced. And so we're just working through that right now, trying to understand what the lead times are for this equipment. This is not equipment off the shelf. So will need to be fabricated and we'll work quickly. The fortunate thing is right now it's not a time in the market where supply chains are real tight. So we're getting really good response from our vendors, working to understand the root cause of this and when the vendors are involved in that exercise with us as well. So we don't have a specific time frame other than to assure you that we've got the right teams in place. We've got the right organization that's working through this in a professional way to expedite what we can and get this back up and running so that we can achieve our start-up goals. The government has been supportive, they sent -- we have our own fire department there at the site. But the government also sent support and has been very supportive. They've been looking also -- the police, this was normal procedure, looking at the investigation of the causes and we're collaborating on that exercise as well. I think if you look at the world and these smelters, this is not the first time there's been a fire. In Indonesia, the people that we are talking with understand the hazards involved in these types of operations. We're working hard and designing these operations so that they don't have hazards. But if you look at history, there have been have been other similar type incidents. So they understand it, they understand our good faith and getting the smelter completed. And they also understand the economics that this -- continuity will benefit them as we go forward. So I think we'll just continue to work collaboratively to make sure that all of the -- the impacts of this are mitigated, and they can be mitigated through insurance and through continued exports. And that's what we want to make sure that we do to every extent possible is mitigate the impact of this incident. With the Cerro Verde question, Cerro Verde has a public market trades in the relatively small float that trades on the Peruvian Stock Exchange. And so we're interested in buying more if there's opportunities to do it. There were some funds that were interested in selling and we were able to pick up those shares. But it's a high quality asset, very difficult to replicate. And so to the extent there are opportunities to purchase additional shares, we're interested in doing that but that takes a willing seller as well. So we'll just continue to monitor that as we go forward. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : A question back to Indonesia but this is around IUPK. If I overly analyze the 2Q versus 3Q, there was an expectation that you might file for IUPK extension in 2024 in the 2Q release but in 3Q, it feels a little more vague. Am I over-interpreting or is there anything about the end of the year and filing that, that matters to you specifically? Richard Adkerson : Definitely -- let me make one comment here first. We had hoped, based on discussions that go back a couple of years that we would be able to accomplish this during the term of Joko Widodo. And with everything that went on with the transition to the new president, the election occurred months ago but the transition was occurred later, we just weren't able to get it. There's an established regulation in place that provides us the ability to file for and we'll be working with the new government and working on the right time to do that, we feel confident that it will happen. Bob Brackett : A quick follow-up. Can you tease us a little with the pre-feasibility study launched on Safford Lone Star, what should really broad goalposts, what sort of opportunity should we think about? Kathleen Quirk : This is a very large resource. We've been doing a lot of drilling over the last several years and have identified a resource that is multiples of the current reserve. And it's in an established area. It's over the mountain range from Morenci where we've operated for a century more. And Safford is relatively new. I mean it's one of the newest mines in the US, we brought it online in 2007, '08 time frame and then have expanded it to date. So what we have is this opportunity to a vision where you could have another cornerstone asset in this district where we've got talented workforce. We've got an established community support and we've got a resource. And so you could have an operation there that is both doing leaching, which that's what -- it's 100% leach operation today, but could add additional milling there to essentially double the production, the resource might support even more than doubling. But what we're looking at is the opportunity to go from 300 million pounds of copper a year there to $600 million and through efficient leaching and milling operation. And so what we're doing now is designing, based on the resource, what the next step would be in terms of expanding the operation. And we're all very excited about it. We're pushing to really define what it could be. We know from the resource, it could be something that will be with us for a very long time. And so that's the objective. We're doing the pre-feasibility study work and we'll have more information next year about what a project could look like. One of the things that is important to recognize here is it's not like El Abra. In that El Abra is going to -- El Abra is a very attractive project, but it takes a long time because of the permitting requirements. We don't have the same degree. We don't believe we'll have the same degree of permitting required for this that you would have in something like El Abra. So it's possible that if this is fast tracked, it could come online not too much different than where El Abra. So that's exciting as well. We're fortunate at Freeport that we have these brownfield opportunities. We have big resources. We have the community support that allows us to grow, and that's what we're doing. We're focused on technology. We're focused on automating what we do to make sure that we can be as efficient as possible long term. And I think technology, not only in our leach initiative but also in our mining initiatives is going to turn the corner and make our US operations much more attractive as we go forward. So that's -- we're working on that in parallel with these studies. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners. Michael Dudas : Maybe you could shed -- I appreciate the comments about North America and the impact on some of your initiatives on the cost side. But maybe you could give a sense of how quickly some of these efficiency initiatives will be moving forward, looking at the marketplace for labor, where do you stand on that? And is there a normalized level or expectation away from the improvement from the leaching contribution that we'd see a moderation in the mining cost, of course, recognizing that the great issues that you've been dealing with? Kathleen Quirk : Well, over the last several quarters, we've had two -- it's been twofold. One is we -- starting in '22, we\u2019ve had rising costs, and that came at a time when we started getting into lower grade. So we've had two things that we've been dealing with. The good news is that we're not seeing the rise in costs like we were previously. And actually, there's some things that -- like energy that have come -- that are actually -- have trended lower. But the thing we're focused on now is making sure that our assets are as productive as possible. We did some benchmarking against our South America operations and back in 2022, the two were pretty much on top of each other in terms of their unit costs. Now when we look at the comparison, there's a big gap between South America and North America and that's mainly this great issue. We haven't had the grade decline in South America like we've had in North America, but that requires us to be more efficient and we think we can do that. We think that we can be more productive with our equipment, more productive with our people as our people are getting better training, more experience, that is a big help. The other issue that we're making some progress on is downtime. We've had some experience in recent years with premature equipment failures. We're turning the corner on that. We're focused on systems and planning our downtime so that when we do go down for planned maintenance that the downtime is delivered, the projects delivered on the cost we expected and in the time frame we expected. But it's a lot of basics but we're making progress. When we look at all the KPIs that we track, the key performance indicators that we track, we're seeing better utilization, better availability on our equipment than we've experienced in recent quarters. And that's just going to have to continue to be the case that we have to work day in, day out to achieve better asset availability and productivity metrics. The other thing we're focused on is contractor costs. We've had some labor rate increases that have not been insignificant but the contractor costs have been even more significant. So what we're doing there is we're reducing the amount of contractors that we have in our operations. We're down about 10% or so from where we were and we're allocating our own internal resources differently to reduce costs there that will be something we're continuing to work on. The other thing we're doing in our global supply chain group is leading an effort to really push back what's happened over the last couple of years with component parts and all aspects of maintenance supplies. People are trying to push through cost increases, price increases on equipment and parts. And we just don't see the data that supports that. So we're pushing back on that. We're looking to bring costs back down to reasonable levels where our vendors can generate returns but not egregious returns. So we've got multifaceted, multifaceted initiatives going on. As you mentioned, the leach initiative is one component of that and that's going to help a lot. But there are other areas that we've got teams focused on. And we will make progress if we continue to follow these key performance indicators and achieve these targets that we've set out that each of our teams know about, know what we need to do, we will bring down the cost even though grades may not improve. So that's something that we're committed to. And I think you'll start to see in 2025 all other things being equal in terms of input costs but you'll see our unit cost trending lower in the US compared to where they are now. And I'll ask Josh or Maree, either of you, if you want to add to anything I commented on, on costs. This is a big effort for our whole team. So anybody else want to comment, please do. Josh Olmsted : Kathleen, I think you touched on everything that I was going to touch on. I mean really the laser focus by the team on efficiencies, productivities and managing our costs via contractor spend are really key in driving our unit cost down in addition to the work in the maintenance and reliability space. The more reliable our equipment is, the more productive it is and therefore, that just helps all the way across the board, not only from a deviser perspective but also from a cost perspective, because when equipment is down it typically costs more. So you touched on the things that are the most important for us. And we're very, very focused organizationally on those key performance indicators so that we can manage that stuff on a day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month basis and drive it in the direction we need to go. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Orest Wowkodaw : My question is around the same lines with respect to cost. I mean with North American cost above $3 and South America around $2.50, I understand that you're working on some cost reduction initiatives. But should we think about sort of the go forward run rate for costs in North America more in the $2.50 to $3 range post these initiatives with South America more in the $2.25 to $2.50 a pound? Like is that just the new reality of today's cost environment? Kathleen Quirk : I think directionally, that's right. Now to the extent that we can bring down some of these input costs, that will help but I think that is what you're saying is accurate. Now I want to remind everybody that our leach initiative, if we're successful there and continuing to scale that's a big deal. So you're talking about costs in the US for average today in the $3 range, this leach initiative is bringing on incremental pounds at a cost of less than $1. And so that will bring down the average as we scale it more, because the reason why it's so attractive is because this is getting more copper out of what's already been mined. So the mining cost is a big part of the overall cost of copper production. And this is taking advantage of material that's already been mined and investing some incremental costs to get more. So that could really make a difference. And that's why we're talking about it so much and we're making progress on it, it could it could really change the cost structure in the US. And we've got some opportunities for leach, in particular, at El Abra that we're pursuing but the meaningful impact will be in our US operations, principally Morenci and Safford and our Chino mine. Orest Wowkodaw : Just as a follow-up to that, I mean, we've seen North American costs creep up seemingly quarter-over-quarter. Where do you see that inflection point? Should we -- do you think we peaked here at 3.14 a pound or could we still see those costs flatline or go higher before they start coming down on the new leaching? Kathleen Quirk : Our objectives and our targets are that they'll come down. So we should -- you should see -- in 2025, you should see lower costs from what we had in 2024. Now that depends on moly and some other things but just site production costs you should see costs trending lower in 2025 from where they were in '24. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Daniel Major with UBS. Daniel Major : The first one, just on the sort of M&A capital allocation. You've acquired some more stock in Cerro Verde, but as you mentioned, you need a willing seller. I guess two parts to the question. Assuming you can't buy any more stock in Cerro Verde going forward, should we expect Freeport share buybacks in Q4 and into Q1 of next year? That's the first part of the question. Kathleen Quirk : Well, I was just going to say, Richard, we're following our framework for cash allocation for shareholder returns. And so we deploy 50% of cash flow to -- cash flow available after CapEx, excluding the discretionary items, of 50% to shareholder returns and 50% to organic growth. And so we do expect that share purchases, to the extent that we're generating cash above the current dividend levels, will be available for us in the future to continue to buy stock back. The Cerro Verde was opportunistic. If there are opportunities in the future to buy Cerro Verde stock, like we said, it's a very high quality asset and so that's really just an opportunistic purchase. Richard Adkerson : We have ongoing discussions with our shareholders and there's obviously differences in views about dividends versus stock buybacks. But this is something we actively discuss with our Board at every meeting and we'll be making decisions. It's great to be in a position now to be able to have those discussions and we're well below our debt levels targets. So we'll be able to execute this policy that Kathleen just spoke with you about. Daniel Major : And maybe a follow-up, if I could, just on bigger picture, M&A. You're obviously seeing larger scale transactions starting to become more prominent in the sector. Is this something that you see as an opportunity going forward before some of these larger assets potentially get kind of taken off the market? Kathleen Quirk : We monitor market activity\u2026 Richard Adkerson : I've said for a long time that M&A is coming in our industry and it certainly will. And we're engaged in observing what goes on, discussions with our bankers and with other companies to see what opportunities might arise. But M&A is not fundamental to our strategy. I mean, we are focused and have opportunities to grow values for our shareholders organically and that's our primary focus, but we'll be in the marketplace and prepare to respond to opportunities. I've always felt that the best M&A comes from opportunities as opposed to predetermined strategic moves. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lawson Winder with Bank of America Securities. Lawson Winder : Just wanted to ask about capital allocation, particularly with respect to the larger projects. So I'm thinking of Bagdad and thinking of El Abra and thinking as now Lone Star. Would it be fair to characterize your decision making as one where you would wait on a decision on Bagdad until you have the information on the study that you're now expecting at the end of next year for both El Abra and Lone Star? Kathleen Quirk : Well, Bagdad is a project that we can execute in the near term. We do want to -- and we've got the information on El Abra. So we know the comparison between El Abra and Bagdad. For Lone Star, we need to get these studies done and that's why we're pushing to get the studies done next year, that will help us assess that. But Bagdad is something that can be executed in a three to four year horizon. Lone Star, Safford will take longer to evaluate. But yes, in a perfect world we would like to have and that's the beauty of Freeport in that we have -- we manage all of these assets. And so we can look at capital allocation as to where it makes the most sense, where it has the best impact, the best returns for us to evaluate projects next to each other. So that's a real advantage and we do that regularly to make sure we're allocating capital to the projects that make the most sense, not just to the projects that we can do. We want to invest our capital in the projects that drive the most value. There are other considerations in terms of time frames that can be executed within et cetera. But generally, that's our philosophy is to allocate capital to the most valuable projects within our portfolio to compare and contrast those. So we will have more information on Safford next year and look at that next to Bagdad. But we think that Bagdad will -- the project will benefit Bagdad long term. Again, we're talking about -- we've got an 80 year plus reserve life there. And so that is a place where we feel investments make sense. And that's part of what guides our investment decisions is where do we have the resource and in this case, an established operation that we can leverage from. But they're not mutually exclusive. We can do more than one project. And so our goal is to -- if we've got projects that create value and we can execute those efficiently, we want to advance those aggressively. Lawson Winder : And then just my follow-up would be just thinking about 2025 CapEx. I mean, how would you handicap thinking about that? I mean should we be thinking about 2025 CapEx being sort of in line with 24 ex smelter or should we be thinking about the possibility of major CapEx commitment at some point in '25, that would be cash outflow next year? Kathleen Quirk : At this point in time, we don't see a major change to '25 CapEx. We do have some investments in our discretionary bucket in '25 to advance Bagdad, to derisk Bagdad. We're making some investments in power infrastructure. We're making some investments in tailings work that we're doing that we'd have to do anyway longer term. So we do have some investments in Bagdad in 2025 to derisk the overall project. But I don't see, based on the projects we're talking about in terms of El Abra, Bagdad, Lone Star, I don't see significant CapEx above what we have in our 2025 plans. But we'll continue to review those. If there's opportunities for us to advance things and that makes sense, we'll certainly be open to it. But at this point in time, this is our best estimate of what capital will look like in 2025. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Bill Peterson with JP Morgan. Bennett Moore : I wanted to start real quick, if you could provide any updates on some of your smaller and near term discretionary projects on Slide 23, namely increasing stacking at Lone Star, Atlantic Copper recycling and the improvements at the Grasberg mill? Kathleen Quirk : Just for everyone else, what he's talking about is these are the discretionary projects that are included in our capital that generally are not maintenance related that actually have investment returns associated with them. The Lone Star oxide expansion is coming to an end. We're going to be completing that in the 2025 time frame. And so that will allow us to basically sustain 300 million pounds of copper per annum. Beyond that, Lone Star, we're talking about a major expansion and that is what we were talking about earlier studying. At Grasberg, we're installing a copper cleaner that will allow us to improve our concentrate grades and our metal recoveries. That investment is -- essentially, we've completed the major construction and we'll be installing that project, commissioning that project here in the fourth quarter. So that one is coming to an end, you won't see any significant cost for that one in 2025. The circular project at Atlantic Copper is taking advantage of Atlantic Copper's position in the market, the existing infrastructure. And we're developing a new circuit there to recycle e-scrap, electronic scrap material and that project is underway. It's expected to be in production next year, at the end of next year and it is going to add to Atlantic Copper. This may not be significant overall to Freeport, $60 million per annum, but it's significant to Atlantic Copper and particularly in the context of of low TCRCs. This allows Atlantic Copper to continue to generate business outside of copper and it's -- Atlantic is very well suited to do this kind of work and recycling the material that are in phones and other things that have value. So that project is in construction, and as I said, expect to be completed next year. Bennett Moore : And then real quick, if I could just ask about the progress of the cleanup work going on at Grasberg, you've had success with placing this remote pumping equipment that you were speaking to last quarter? Kathleen Quirk : We've made a lot of progress there. Things are -- continue to go very well at Grasberg. The team did well this quarter and actually exceeded the forecast, was able to get more tons through the mill than we had forecast and grades were strong. And so operations there are continuing to go very well. Operator : And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to management. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks, Regina. Thank you, everyone, for all your good questions and participation. And we look forward to continue to keep you updated. And if you have any follow-ups, please contact David. Operator : And that will conclude today's call. We thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning everyone and welcome to the Freeport Conference Call. Earlier this morning FCX reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 operating and financial results. A copy of today\u2019s release with supplemental schedules and slides are available on our website fxc.com. Today's conference call is being broadcast live on the Internet. Anyone may listen to the conference call by accessing our Web site homepage and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call. A replay of the webcast will be available on our Web site later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include non-GAAP measures and forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the cautionary language included in our press release and slides and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings, all of which are available on our Web site. Also on the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, Chairman of the Board; Kathleen Quirk, President and Chief Executive Officer; Maree Robertson, Executive Vice President and CFO, and other senior members of our management team. Richard will make some opening remarks, Kathleen and Maree will review our slide materials, and then we'll open up the call for questions. Richard? Richard Adkerson : Good morning everyone. Thank you all for joining us. Kathleen will review our continuing strong operating performance, a strong financial position in our significant organic growth opportunities. Maree will review our financial outlook. Goes without saying, we're living in a very interesting world today. We have new presidents in the United States and in Indonesia. At Freeport, we will support their administrations as we do in all of the countries where we operate. Our first work with Prabowo Subianto in Indonesia in the late 1990s when he was General in [Indiscernible]. At that time, he helped us resolve social unrest in our operating area at Papua. Kathleen and I met with him recently in Jakarta, again in Washington and in Lima at APAC. I was very impressed by his knowledge of global affairs and his candid engagement on issues important to investors. We're now working with his government on several issues important to our company, including obtaining permission to continue exporting copper concentrates in 2025 as we complete repairs from the unfortunate fire at our massive new smelter and as we work on extension of our license to operate beyond 2041. I'm confident we will find common ground on these and other issues as we have done over the almost 60 years of our operating in Indonesia. I'll turn the call over to Kathleen and look forward to our comments. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you Richard. Thanks everyone for being on the call. I'm pleased to report on our fourth quarter results, review our 2024 performance and update you on our projects and outlook for the future. We look back on our performance in 2024 and I'm on slide 3 here. Our team executed our plans in solid fashion. We enhanced our strong foundation to support a positive long-term future centered on value creation. We show on slide 3 the annual information on our copper sales, unit cost and financial metrics for the year 2024 compared to 2023. Our team delivered on our plan. We essentially met our sales targets developed at the start of 2024 and we slightly improved on net unit cash costs compared with 2023 and our plan going into the year. We're proud of Freeport's long track record for successful execution and we don't take this as a given. It requires that we stay disciplined each day on managing the many underlying metrics which drive our results requires that we manage risk and stay on top of what matters, both for the short term and the long term. It also requires that we find solutions to overcome unforeseen challenges which as we all know are inevitable given the nature of our business. Strong operational execution combined with improved pricing allowed us to achieve $10 billion in EBITDA for the year 2024. That was 14% above 2023 EBITDA and our operating cash flows in 2024 of over $7 billion or 35% improved from the prior year. This was on an average copper realization during 2024 of 421 per pound and our realization for gold was slightly above 2,400 per ounce. As we go forward, our team is focused on opportunities to continuously improve and drive value in our existing operations and through our organic growth portfolio. We look at our priorities for 2025. Our team is very focused on a number of initiatives and I'm going to outline the key ones here. The first one, and this is a theme at Freeport every day it's execution. Our team is committed to strong execution of our plans again this year doing what we say, delivering on our plan, volumes, cost targets and capital projects safely and efficiently, while seeking opportunities to capture upside. A second focus area is scaling our reach opportunity. We set a target to reach a run rate of \u00a3300 million by the end of 2025 and to build on that with additional scale in 2026 on our path to \u00a3800 million of incremental copper per annum by 2030. A third focus area is the PTFI smelter. Our team has executed this complex project well and has stepped up to respond to the recent fire incident. We have a plan, a solid recovery plan that we're executing on and that will enable us to deliver this project during 2025. It's important for us not only to be fully integrated and get the smelter up and running, but also important as we seek to extend our operating rights beyond 2041 in Indonesia, you'll see us talking more about innovation. Innovation is a major priority as we go forward. Our work-to-date indicates a significant untapped potential value in this area and we've got a team working on it to drive that value. Equally important, we're continuing to build optionality in our growth portfolio. We have a number of key milestones identified in 2025 and we've got three major projects that we're currently working on for future growth. I'm going to review markets on slide 5 and you can see where copper prices have been. They traded in a broad range during the year 2024 between $3.67 and $4.92 per pound, averaging $4.15 per pound on the LME. On the U.S. COMEX exchange prices were slightly higher than the LME and year-to-date the differential has grown and is now is average about $0.17 per pound through the first part of 2025. During 2024, copper prices mostly followed macro sentiment, which weighed favorable U.S. economic data, rate cuts in the U.S. and the potential for economic stimulus in China against ongoing economic pressures in China, a strong U.S. dollar and uncertainties on U.S. tariff and trade policies that the markets have been focused on from late last year. At a micro level, demand continues to grow and that's supported by secular demand trends associated with electrification, which has offset some of the impact of weakness that we've seen in certain more cyclical sectors. In the U.S. our customers are reporting solid demand for power cable and building wire associated with substantial investment in electrical infrastructure and AI data centers. Growth in the power sector is offsetting weakness in traditional demand sectors currently coming from residential construction weakness and the auto sector. Turning to China, demand from China continues to be supported by significant investments in the electrical grid and continued growth in China's production of electric vehicles. We've seen a highly publicized reports of weakness in China's property sector and that's influenced sentiment, but the reality is China's demand for copper continues to grow, albeit it had modest growth in demand in 2024. We're seeing recent data points out of China that indicate a number of sectors are poised for better growth in 2025 and together with potential stimulus actions to support economic growth targets, there's support for potentially higher growth in demand from China as we move through 2025. We want to highlight copper's superior conductivity and that makes it the metal when it comes to electrification. New massive investment in the power grid, renewable generation technology, infrastructure and transportation are driving increased demand for copper and forecast call for above trend growth in demand for the foreseeable future. As we match this up with supply, we continue to see a balanced market near term and significant deficit conditions longer run. This is going to require significant investment by the industry as well as innovative technologies to build supplies longer term. And at Freeport, we're driven to supply copper reliably and responsibly to this growing market. We'll move into the fourth quarter results on Slide 6 where we provide a summary of the results. Our operating performance in the fourth quarter was solid. Our sales and net unit costs were slightly better than our guidance going into the quarter. We've made a lot of progress since our last update call in October at our Indonesian smelter and refinery project. The smelter recovery activities are in progress. Long lead items are expected to arrive in the March April time frame and we expect to recommence production by middle of this year. The precious metals refinery, which was designed to refine precious metals from our existing smelter in Indonesia as well as the new smelter, was not impacted by the fire and we produced our first gold bar in late 2024. Startup operations at the refinery have gone very well and following completion of the smelter ramp up, our Indonesian mining and smelting operations will be fully integrated. In parallel with working on the smelter recovery, we've made great progress with the Indonesian government to allow U.S. exports during the period of the smelter repairs. We did receive approval in late 2024 to update our quota for the year 2024 and that allowed us to make some additional shipments in December. We're currently working with the government on 2025 exports and we expect to receive approval in the first quarter. We're also working very hard to progress initiatives to build value from organic growth. We benefited Freeport from a large reserve and resource position with near term, medium term and long term embedded growth options. We're challenging ourselves to take advantage of innovation and improve efficiencies, reduce cost and capital intensity and shorten lead times for our projects. The high potential innovative leach initiative is a great example of this. We achieved an approximate 50% in copper production from this initiative in 2024 at a very low cost and have projects in motion to target an annual run rate of \u00a3300 million by the end of this year and that's 40% higher than what we achieved in 2024 with opportunity for further gains in the future. We're also advancing our brownfield expansion opportunities to position the business for longer term growth to supply a market with increased requirements for copper. We ended the quarter in a strong position financially. As we look forward, we see great value in our business supported by our leadership role in copper. A market with highly attractive fundamental outlook matched up with our portfolio of high quality assets and future prospects for strong cash flow generation to support investments in value enhancing projects and returns to shareholders. I'll go through on Slide 7, our operations update across our geographic regions. And I'll start with the U.S. where we're making good progress with our initiatives to improve efficiencies and cost performance despite a decline in ore grades in recent history. Data we monitor regularly regarding our asset efficiencies and other key indicators have trended more favorably over the last several months. As we look forward, we expect production in the U.S. to increase by 8% in 2025 with opportunities for further increases in 2026 and 2027. Absent changes in commodity based input costs, we're targeting unit costs to trend lower each year over this three year period. With 2024 behind us, our goal is to make 2024 the low watermark year for our U.S. business. Structurally, we deal with low ore grades in the U.S. and hauls are getting longer. The autonomous haul truck conversion being deployed in 2025 at Baghdad will allow us to test the potential for this application on a broader scale at other operations. The incremental leach pounds at scale will also benefit our cost position as we go forward. We also initiated a new project during 2024 centered on integrating new technology and automation to optimize performance in our basic mining functions. We believe there's significant opportunity here for value creation through meaningful cost reduction which would enhance margins and also expand reserves from known mineralization which is currently economically limited under our current reserve pricing. Many of you have been following this. We're following it very closely. U.S. legislation considering copper as a critical mineral for integrated producers. If this is enacted, this will give us a further benefit of potentially being eligible for a tax credit of 10% of our operating costs in the U.S. In South America, the team in our Cerro Verde operation posted another solid quarter with strong operating rates and no recoveries. The team is doing a really good job with cost management as evidenced by a 13% improvement in South America cost unit cost over the year ago fourth quarter. As you'll see in our guidance, Cerro Verde grades are expected to be slightly lower in 2025 compared with 2024. We expect long term averages to recover to the 900 million pound per annum range at Cerro Verde. At El Abra, we're positive about the opportunity to test an initiative to add heat to our leach process and that has a lot of promise to provide incremental near term production there. Turning to Indonesia, we had another solid quarter and the team achieved multiple new operating records again in 2024. Our team is consistently delivering strong volumes of both copper and gold from our large scale underground ore bodies and has demonstrated this consistently over the last several years. During late 2024 we successfully completed construction of a project $500 million range project to install a copper cleaner circuit to enhance mill performance at Grasberg. And as you'll see in the reference slide on slide 26, the outlook for Grasberg is positive with a strong multiyear outlook for significant copper and gold production. For 2025 our guidance at Grasberg reflects downtime associated with two major mill repair projects scheduled during the year. This is expected to result in lower volumes in the first quarter compared with the balance of 2025. We also wanted to comment we've received some questions about recent press reports coming out of Indonesia regarding a potential change in requirements for retention of export proceeds. There were new regulations issued in 2023 and that required PTFI to deposit 30% of its U.S. dollar export proceeds in a domestic cash bearing account for 90 days. The government is currently considering potential changes to this regulation which would increase the requirement but also allow withdrawals from the balances to fund business requirements. The details of the potential modifications have not been finalized and Freeport and other companies in Indonesia are discussing the proposals with the government in an effort to avoid requirements that could have a negative impact on our business. We'll move to our growth and innovative leach opportunity where we continue to be encouraged by the significant value potential from this initiative. The chart on the left side of slide 8 shows our progress over the last few years. We've been successful in deploying a new series of operating practices to recover incremental copper previously thought to be waste. Our recent gains have been in the areas of adding scale to our targeted solution injection wells, innovative approaches to reaching areas in the leach stockpile previously inaccessible, and expanding thermal covers on top of the stockpiles and optimizing our solution chemistry. We have several additional projects underway in 2025 and we're targeting reaching the annual run rate of \u00a3300 million by the end of this year with the potential to produce \u00a3300 million to \u00a3400 million during 2026 from these initiatives. We're really excited about projects being planned to add heat to the stockpiles and field testing of additives. Ultimately our goal is to achieve \u00a3800 million per annum from this value enhancing growth initiative, the size of a major new mine that's got very low capital investment required very low incremental operating costs which will significantly enhance the value and competitive position of our Americas production. Just to comment on the cost of this innovative leach to date it's been well below a dollar incrementally per pound and what's so exciting about it is we're bringing on production of product that was considered waste in the past. We've already incurred the mining costs so we're spending incremental dollars to get it more copper and it's got really a lot of value potential and that's why we're pursuing it so aggressively. We've got an extensive inventory of substantial residual copper from material already mined. We've got industry leading technical expertise and a strong multidiscipline innovation team dedicated to the initiative. On slide nine is a brief update on our organic growth projects, all of which are brownfield opportunities where we can leverage existing assets and establish operations. We talked about the leach opportunity. In addition, we also have opportunities for expansion at Baghdad and our Safford Lone Star operations in the U.S. At Baghdad, we're continuing to make investments in site infrastructure and tailings expansion to position us to execute the project more efficiently when the time is right. We expect to have the majority or most of the autonomous trucks deployed in the field this year. That will provide the ability to be more efficient with labor at this remote location. In parallel, we're also continuing to pursue opportunities to reduce the capital intensity of the project. We're monitoring markets and site specific factors and hope to be in a position to make a decision on the path forward by year end. In the Safford Lone Star district where we already have existing operations, it's our newest mine in the U.S. we're engaged in studies to define major brownfield expansion. We're targeting opportunities there that could double the current production levels of \u00a3300 million per annum. We've got a very large resource at this location and expect this district will become a significant asset for Freeport in Arizona in the next decade. At El Abra in Chile, we've talked about this in the past. We're preparing an environmental impact statement. We expect to be complete and submitted by the end of this year. The project involves investment in a new concentrator of scale similar to the size of the Cerro Verde concentrator we installed 10 years ago. We've got plans for investments in a desalinization plant and also a pipeline system to support our water requirements. The opportunity from the project is to provide 750 million pounds of annual copper production. It's very large scale and 9 million pounds of molybdenum per annum. It's got a long lead time to it. It requires seven to eight years of lead time. We're currently advancing it to provide options for the future and value driven options to boost our production in the future as the world needs more copper. In Indonesia, we're continuing to develop the Kucing Liar ore body within the Grasberg district. That development continues towards a targeted commencement of production by 2030. We're also very excited about additional exploration opportunities below the deep MLZ ore body and extension of our operating rights will set us up for additional long term development options in this highly attractive and valuable district. Our overall objective is this to move quickly to define the opportunities across the portfolio, rank them on value potential and allocate capital on a risk reward basis to provide profitable growth options for the future. We're going to be disciplined in our approach targeting opportunities that enhance long-term value and where we believe we can create that value at a at a manageable risk. We're moving to our outlook on slide 10 where we show a three year outlook for sales volumes of copper, gold and molybdenum. Our Copper guidance for 2025 as you'll note, has been adjusted by approximately 5% that incorporates updated estimates for the mill maintenance projects planned in 2025 in Indonesia. Our gold estimates for 2025 are about 7% higher than the prior estimates and that's benefiting from inventory drawdowns during 2025 and also slightly higher ore grades for gold. We provide quarterly estimates on slide 25 of the reference materials. The first quarter volumes are expected to be the lowest of the year because of mill maintenance and timing associated with the expected export approvals. But you'll see we get back to large scale production as we move through the year. Our 2026 guidance for copper is unchanged and our gold for 2026 is up about 100,000 ounces. Compared with our prior guidance, we've added 2027 to our outlook, which is similar to the outlook for 2026. For slide 11 we show our cost estimates for 2025 and we show the geographic mix which has an impact on the overall average. When you look at our cash cost estimate currently for 2025 of 160 per pound that compares to $1.56 per pound in 2024. The two results are similar, but the weighting of volumes between the regions results in a slight increase. The important point we want to get across on this slide is that we expect U.S. costs to be lower in 2025 and we're focused on driving these costs lower as we go forward. You can see the cost by region presented on Slide 24 in the reference material which will show you the makeup of the cost. I'll now turn the call over to Maree who is going to review our cash flow outlook and then we'll come back and take your questions. Turn it to you, Maree. Maree Robertson : Thanks Kathleen. Just turning to slide 12, putting together our projected volumes and cost projections, we show modelled results on slide 12 for our EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $4 per pound to $5 per pound. These are modelled results using the average of 2026 and 2027 with current volume and cost estimates and holding gold flat at $2,700 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $20 per pound. Annual EBITDA would range from over $11 billion per annum at $4 copper to over $15 billion per annum at $5 copper. Operating cash flows at these ranges would be nearly $8 billion per year at $4 and over $11 billion per year at 5. We show sensitivities to various commodities on the right you will note we are highly leveraged to copper prices with each $0.10 per pound change equating to approximately $425 million in annual EBITDA. We will also benefit from improving gold prices with each $100 per ounce change in price approximating $150 million in annual EBITDA. With our long lived reserves and large scale production, we are well positioned to generate substantial cash flow to fund future organic growth and cash returns under our performance based payout framework. Moving to slide 13 this shows our current forecast for capital expenditures in 2025 and 2026. Capital expenditures for 2024 were $3.6 billion and are expected to approximate $4.4 billion per year in 2025 and 2026. 2025 capital expenditures are about 5% above our October estimate which largely reflects minor revisions to project estimates and an increased allocation of capitalized interest. The discretionary projects approximated $1 billion in 2024 and are expected to approximate $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion in 2025 and 2026 with roughly 50% related to the Kucing Liar development and the LNG project at Grasberg. The balance includes acceleration of tailings and other infrastructure to support the Baghdad expansion, the Atlantic Copper Circular project which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2026 and allocated capitalized interest. The discretionary category reflects the capital investments we are making in new projects that under our financial policy are funded with the 50% of available cash that is not distributed. These projects are value enhancing initiatives and are detailed on Slide 28 in our reference materials. We have a track record of managing capital in a disciplined manner and we will continue to deploy capital in a manner that builds long term value. And finally on slide 14 we reiterate the financial policy priorities centred on a strong balance sheet, cash returns to shareholders and investments in value enhancing growth projects. Our balance sheet is strong with investment grade ratings, strong credit metrics and flexibility within our debt targets to execute on our projects. In the fourth quarter we redeemed $730 million in maturing senior notes for cash. We have no significant debt maturities until 2027. We have distributed $4.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases since implementing the financial policy and have an attractive future long term portfolio that will enable us to continue to build long term value for shareholders. We actively monitor current market conditions and carefully manage the timing of our projects to ensure our financial flexibility remains strong. Our global team is focused on driving value in our business, committed to strong execution of our plans and providing cash to invest in profitable growth and returns to shareholders. Thank you everyone for your attention. I will now hand back to Kathleen and we can take your questions. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you Maree. Operator, we're ready to take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Liam Fitzpatrick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Liam Fitzpatrick : Good morning, Kathleen and Richard. I'll just stick to one question, given the guidance there. Just around the approval of the approval to export concentrate from Indonesia, you said you hoped to receive it in Q1, but do you have any more visibility on when in Q1? And does there come a point in this quarter when you'll start to run out of storage capacity? And therefore could that start to impact your production rates and your guidance? Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, Liam. As we mentioned, we're making really good progress with the government. We've reviewed with them the incident, the repairs, the lead times required. They visited the site and they are -- they've indicated support for allowing us to continue exports during 2025. They've also encouraged us to move as quickly as we can to finish the repairs, but they've indicated support for this. Now it's a matter of getting documentation for the amendment to the regulation. We understand that they're working on the drafts of the new regulation or the amendment to the regulation to allow this, and we expect this to be approved in the near term. We've got some maintenance going on at Grasberg, as I mentioned, and so our inventories are building still. We're still shipping to our existing smelter there, but our inventories are building a little bit. But if we get this export permit, as we expect in the coming weeks, will be good to start shipping exports and also bringing down those inventories. Liam Fitzpatrick : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Katja Jancic with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Katja Jancic : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Kathleen you mentioned the 10% tax credit potential. What are some of the next steps that need to happen for copper to actually qualify for that? And is there any timeline? In other words, is this still possible in 2025? Kathleen Quirk : It's a matter of legislation. There was a bill that passed through the House late last year which allowed for the copper to be added to the list. And so we've got to get additional legislation passed through with other processes in the U.S. and so it still is possible. We're flagging it, we're monitoring it, and so I can't predict U.S. legislation, timing, but it is important. There are a number. It's a bipartisan support for this, and so we're following very closely. Katja Jancic : Okay, thank you. Kathleen Quirk : \u2026which would be very significant for us if you look, something on the order of $500 million of benefit. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Alex Hacking with Citi. Please go ahead. Alexander Hacking : Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Just digging into the discretionary capex spend for 2025. The 400 million at Baghdad on the tailings infrastructure. Is that explicitly tied to the expansion or that's something you would need to do anyway. And is that part of the $3.5 billion CapEx for the project and then the 600 million at the Kucing Liar. When that arrives, can you remind me, does it increase Grasberg production or it's just going to fill the mill as other sources of ore are depleting? Thank you very much. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, Alex. With respect to Baghdad, we do need to expand tailings infrastructure long term. We don't need to do it now. And that's why it's discretionary. If we don't move forward with an expansion, those dollars could be deferred into the future. But what we're doing now is advancing this tailings infrastructure that we would have to do in any case in the future so that it gives us better optionality once we decide on whether to move forward, to move more quickly. So we could, we could, if we decide not to move forward with Baghdad, we could push that sailing investment out. The 3.5 billion of capital for the Baghdad expansion is really the incremental capital. The tailings would have to be done at some point in the future in any case. So we don't include that as capital for the expansion. But we do have flexibility on the timing of this tailings infrastructure if we don't go forward with the expansion. And then on KL, what we're talking about there is under our long term plans, adding 90,000 tons a day from KL. We're also looking at the opportunity to bring more KL production as we look at the mine plans longer term. And that will allow us to sustain a very long life at high rates at Grasberg as we go through 2041. When we think about the extension beyond 2041, there's a lot of KL material that's still left over at the end of 2041. So an extension would essentially allow us to increase reserves without additional exploration. So it's part of our long range plans. We had always expected to have some declines in various ore bodies over time and this will allow us to sustain long term large scale production at Grasberg. Alexander Hacking : Thank you. Kathleen Quirk : Thanks Alex. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Chris LaFemina : Thanks operator. Hi Kathleen. Hi Richard. Thanks for taking my question. I'm just thinking about kind of the geopolitical risk profile for Freeport. So your organic growth is mostly in the Americas, but Indonesia at the end of the day, because it's such an amazing ore body, it's always going to be a significant contributor to earnings and a really important part of the Freeport investment case. And if we think back to the acquisition of Phelps Dodge, in hindsight that was brilliant because it gave you geographic diversification and when you did have challenges in Indonesia, you had other assets in the portfolio that were able to basically sustain the business as you dealt with those other challenges. One option now which is an option that it sounds like you're pursuing is early stage investments in these longer lead time organic growth projects which at the end of the day would help diversify your earnings mix a little bit more to the Americas. But I wonder, is M&A similar to what Phelps Dodge was for you nearly 20 years ago, is M&A a potential path to de risking the business from a geopolitical perspective. Again, Grasberg amazing ore body always going to be near the bottom of the cost curve. But a lot of the kind of value leakage that we consistently see there seems like these problems don't really ever come to an end. There's always some new negotiation that has to happen or some new kind of source of kind of a pound of flesh out of Freeport to continue to operate there. So just thinking about the geopolitical risk in general. Thanks. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, Chris. In terms of the investment case, of course we've got a great opportunity in Indonesia and as Richard was saying earlier, we've got close to a 60 year history there and our team has always found a way to execute very positively and generate value. So we have a lot of confidence and feel positive about the long term outlook there. But in terms of the opportunities, we're really excited about the investment case we have in the Americas and particularly in the U.S. And the Leach initiative, when you think about getting to \u00a3800 million and I know we're not yet we've got more work to do to get there but the opportunity to have 800 million pounds of incremental copper at a cash cost which is way less than the current $3 and we've been less than $1 right now and really very limited CapEx, you're talking about an opportunity there where some people are investing $10 billion to achieve that and we're not having to do that. So we have a lot of opportunity to create value in the U.S. not only from the leach opportunity but also from these cost reduction opportunities and those drop right to the bottom line. We've got this new innovation initiative that we stood up last year and, and we've got ambitious targets to reduce our costs meaningfully in the U.S. That will drop right to the bottom line and create a lot of value not only from being able to have higher margins, but expanding the reserves. Because we've got a lot of reserves in the U.S. that are economically limited. So we're very excited about the opportunity for low capital intensity opportunities in the U.S. that will generate a lot of value. You remember that drops to the bottom line. We don't have significant taxes we're paying in the U.S. we don't have a royalty structure, etcetera. So we're very, very excited about that. With regard to M&A and let Richard comment as well on his thoughts. But we do monitor, we do monitor opportunities across the industry on a regular basis. The Phelps Dodge opportunity that you mentioned in 2007, we were not planning to do an acquisition but the opportunity was presented and we were able to take advantage of it because we were prepared. So we will always look, we will always be prepared for opportunities as they may come, but we don't see as part of our strategy getting involved in a competitive auction process or something on that order. We'll look to M&A for opportunities where we can generate synergies, where we can use our technical capabilities to add value to existing operations. This leach initiative is one that may give us an opportunity in the future to, to consolidate more and generate more value from it. But it's not necessarily. We don't have to do an M&A. We look, we will be opportunistic but we feel within our own plan we've got a real opportunity to create value and don't have to do M&A. But Richard, you want to add to anything I said there? Richard Adkerson : Thanks, Kathleen. Thank Chris. And I'm going to try to be real short with this. Chris, we can talk later, but you point out how acquiring Phelps Dodge helped diversify Freeport in Indonesia. But on the other hand, having Indonesia to support the operations in the Americas gave us the ability to be much more aggressive in the way we managed those operations and took advantage of opportunities in Phelps Dodge or any other company could have with those low grade mines. Actually, I've been talking to Phelps Dodge for almost 10 years before we acquired them to get them to acquire us. And they never would do it. The world changed with China, and we had that opportunity. You look back on our industries when management teams, and this goes across many companies. When management teams or boards force an M&A transaction for strategic reasons, it's almost always a bad answer. So we position ourselves to run our company without having to make acquisitions. But we're in the market so that if an opportunity comes to us, we're in a position to take advantage of it. I believe in our industry, M&A, driven by opportunities is the way to have successful M&A. Chris LaFemina : Thank you for that. Richard Adkerson : Good luck. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, Chris. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Major with UBS. Please go ahead. Daniel Major : Hi there. Can you hear me okay? Kathleen Quirk : Yes. Daniel Major : Great. Thanks. A few questions. Just the first one. I noticed increase in the CapEx allocated to the smelter at Grasberg. Is there any insurance coverage for the additional work to fix the fire of the smelter? Kathleen Quirk : The repair cost is estimated at approximately $100 million. And so that is covered by insurance. We have not increased our estimates overall for the cost of the smelter. What you're seeing come through in 2025 for the most part is costs that we incurred in 2024 with the payables in 2025, but the incremental cost of the repairs will be covered. That's roughly $100 million will be covered by insurance. Daniel Major : Okay, that's clear. Thank you. And then second question. Prior to the election. Well, the change of government in Indonesia, you were heading towards, I guess, the conclusion of the review of the license extension, etcetera. Do you have a visibility on the timeline for when you'll be entering the similar process with the new government? Kathleen Quirk : As Richard mentioned, we've met with the new government. We had the opportunity while we were in Indonesia last year, as well as when the president and others had visited the U.S. and Peru. And so we are discussing the benefits of this operation. We are reviewing with the President the financial benefits. He remembers numbers from when he was involved, as Richard said, but he's been very impressed with the performance over the last many years. So we'll engage in that. There's a regulation that was put in place last year that has an outline of how you qualify for the extension. And with the smelter, repairs will be fully integrated, which will allow us to move forward. We also have the 10% requirement to sell an additional 10% effective in 2041. And we're having discussions with [Indiscernible] about a sale and purchase agreement. That's another criteria for the extension. But it's in everyone's interest, and I think both Freeport and the government understand this. It's in everyone's interest to extend this operation to continue to make investments so that the benefits of this wonderful operation can continue well into the future. And that's clearly recognized within the government of Indonesia. But we're hoping to be in a position to apply for the extension during 2025. Daniel Major : Okay, so 2025 timeline. Okay, thanks. Finally, if I could just squeeze one more in just to follow up on the legislative pathway in the Senate [ph] for the critical mineral. Do you have any visibility on when the Senate will be reviewing the bill? Kathleen Quirk : We do not. There are a number of agenda items they're working on and we do not have visibility on it. It's on the agenda for review, but we don't have a timeframe. Daniel Major : Great, thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Orest Wowkodaw : Hi, good morning. Question about your CapEx guidance. I was surprised to see the increase in 2025, but probably the 2026 guide of 4.4 billion seemed high to me. Just given that you haven't approved any of the major growth projects yet, Is there any CapEx associated with those new growth projects in that 2026 continents already? Kathleen Quirk : As we were talking with Alex earlier, we've got some capital in 2026 that if we don't move forward with Baghdad would come out. So that assumes that we're going to go forward. But if we don't decide to go forward, we could spread it out beyond 2026. It also includes some LNG spend. As Maree was saying, we've got over 50% of the discretionary relates to Kucing Liar and LNG. But the only other thing really in there in 2026 is this flexibility around Baghdad's tailings expansion. I will say though, we are going to be very disciplined about CapEx. We have in the past will continue to be. We are going to have to make investments in this business to grow production in the future. We're going to be very focused on bringing down capital intensity, working where we can to defer items that we don't need to spend. And so we review it very carefully and do it in a prudent fashion as we have in the past. Orest Wowkodaw : If I just follow up, what's a good run rate to assume for sustaining capital now for the business, say beyond 2026? Kathleen Quirk : Well, I think what you're looking at, we separate these projects between, the sustaining capital line that you see on the capital. On the capital side, that's a pretty good run rate. The planned investments relate to the most of it relates to the underground at Grasberg. That number will not stay at a billion dollars a year. We expect over time that that can come down. So I mean you're probably looking at something on the order of two to two and a half run rate without major projects. Orest Wowkodaw : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bill Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Bill Peterson : Good morning and thanks for taking the questions and all the details thus far. Realizing the question is hypothetical, but how does Freeport view the potential impacts to copper markets in general and in Freeport specifically from tariffs, whether they be, 10% blanket or 25% towards Mexico or Canada? I mean, I guess what is the ability of Freeport to move product from one region to another? And I guess how does having U.S. assets help protect or even benefit Freeport relative to other copper producers? Kathleen Quirk : Yes, well, in terms of the tariffs with respect to specifically in the U.S. Freeport does not. We basically sell all of our product in the U.S. The U.S. as a market itself does import copper, but we do not export copper from the U.S. so the imports of copper is what people are wondering about and whether those will carry a tariff. And you see the premium being built in right now to the COMEX versus the LME and people are trying to handicap what that tariff might be for copper being imported into the U.S. but for us, we sell copper that we produce in the U.S. in the U.S. if there is a continued premium for copper in the U.S. we would capture that at Freeport because our U.S. contracts are based off of the U.S. price. In terms of globally we produce in Indonesia, we'll be producing copper. Those flows will generally go to Asia, from South America. They will go to generally they don't come to the U.S. the piece from Cerro Verde. So in terms of the impact on our situation, it's not a trade flow issue for us. The more concerning thing that we're watching with respect to tariffs is whether or not they would impact global growth. And that's the focus, the concern that we have. We want to make sure that if tariffs are in place, it doesn't impact overall global growth or create inflationary pressures in the U.S. which we're just coming off of moderating inflation. And so those are the two things that we're focused on, is whether the tariffs will have an impact on overall global economic growth and whether they will be inflationary for our U.S. operations. Those are the two major things. Bill Peterson : Thanks. Thanks for those insights. And then on leaching, and I may have missed it, but, we saw the step down in the quarter, but you're targeting now \u00a3300 million run rate in exiting 2025. I guess maybe in more detail, what drove the sequential decline and on the latter, on the, on the increase, is that driven by expanding efforts in El Abra or is this further tech advances or benefiting from, I guess, prior development that you've already, accomplished? Kathleen Quirk : Yes, the fourth quarter, we essentially met our plan for leach. It was roughly \u00a350 million, which was in line with our plan and reflected the projects that we were doing for this initiative in that quarter. As we look at the -- what's in our estimates right now for 2025, we've got just over roughly 225 million pounds of incremental copper in our current forecast. We have a number of projects that are in progress right now with respect to deep raffinate injection, which is getting access to areas within the stockpile that need to get more solution to it. And we're doing that through injection, through drilling. We're scaling that initiative, got a number of projects where we're continuing to, we call it leach everywhere, get access to areas that previously have not been able to get to. And we found creative ways like using helicopters to get to these areas. And then this heat, this heat opportunity will start to test that later this year and next year. And that's what allows us to scale from 300 to 400. But we think based on the initiatives we have going on now, we should be able to get to 300 by the end of this year and then hopefully by the end of 2026, get into 400 with these additional initiatives we've got going on. So it's on track, it's continuing to get better in terms of opportunity for us. As I was saying before, it's think about the opportunity to get to \u00a3800 million at a very low cost and sustain that. We've got 39 billion pounds of copper that has previously been placed that we've considered waste, and we're trying to get as much of that as we can. If we get 20% of it, that's a huge gain for us. Bill Peterson : Thanks, Kathleen. The best wishes to you and the team in 2025. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, Bill. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Timna Tanners : Yes, hey, thanks for including me. Wanted to just follow up on the a little bit more detail, if you could, on the North American cost cutting initiatives, like how much of that is the more favorable mine plan? How are you seeing labor challenges? How are you considering 45x when you think about growth opportunities on top of already favorable NOLs? Just a little more color there, please. Kathleen Quirk : Well, the 45x would be. It's not in our plans. It would be incremental and be beneficial. 10% reduction in cost. We are really focused on driving costs lower over the next few years. And we're doing that through just the basics. We're really rationalizing contractors. We've had the assets that over the last couple of years have underperformed expectations. We're now starting to get better performance, better efficiencies out of the asset, better utilization, better uptime, reducing the unplanned downtime. That's a key focus of ours. So that's where we're very optimistic in terms of the labor situation. It's stabilized for us. We're not having the turnover that we've had in the last couple of years that stabilized. Stabilized things that allows us to train people, have them be retained and become more productive. I talked about automation. We're doing that. We're doing that at Baghdad. We're going to broaden that. We're going to work on centralizing some opportunities to reduce costs. We've got a whole series of opportunities and we're very excited about this innovation opportunity that will allow us to bring down the cost. And I can't overemphasize how much value that is for us as we look forward. The 45x would be 10%. Our goal is, way more than that to get our costs down. So stay tuned. It's a high on our priority list as we look forward. Timna Tanners : Okay, good. Thanks, Kathleen, for the additional color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Michael Dudas : Good morning, Richard, Kathleen Maree. Kathleen Quirk : Hi Mike. Michael Dudas : Looking at financial profile, Kathleen, with net debt at 0.4 times net billion dollars, I guess ex smelter defending and looking and given comfort levels that you've indicated 3 to 4 billion range and staging of the capital expanding and you get a lot of moving parts. I understand the next couple years, but are you is the strategy to keep this really tight financial profile even as the, because there's going to be much more of the CapEx moving forward funded internally or is there ability given where market prices are and the fundamentals of the business to maybe be a little bit more opportunistic in some capital allocation? Kathleen Quirk : Yes. Well, in terms of the net debt number being around a billion dollars, what the policy is 50% of the available cash is distributed to shareholders and the other half is available to either reduce debt or invest in our projects. And given our profile, we want to invest in projects that have a high value and return on investment. But since implementing the policy in late 2021, our projects have been slower. So these projects take a while to get off the ground. And now you start to see this increase in discretionary spending and we'll be as we talked about earlier, we'll be careful and prudent about how we manage it. But that debt capacity of where we are at a billion versus three to four is really earmarked to fund these discretionary projects. And when we look at the cash available for distribution to shareholders, that line is excluded. So you're really looking at 50% of cash flow that is excluding the discretionary. So just the 1.6% and the 1.1% for this year excluding the discretionary. So we've got room on the balance sheet to fund these discretionary cash with what we've accumulated in the past and the other 50% that we're generating. So we've learned over a long period of time that it's prudent to have a strong balance sheet and we'll continue to do that. But we do have some capacity within our current financial targets to make investments that are prudent, that make sense, that drive value in our business. Michael Dudas : Thanks, Kathleen. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead. Bob Brackett : Good morning. A couple U.S. related questions. One is probably just buckets of capital, but the Lone Star oxide expansion, for example, where has that moved in terms of discretional capital projects? And the other would be an update on jetty resources and sulfide leaching. I think the trial at Baghdad's been there since 22, since 23. Where is your level of prudent optimism should I say? Kathleen Quirk : Yes, well, with respect to the Safford project that's essentially done this year. We're completing that and we're actually Safford's been performing very, very well. So that's being complete. The next phase that we're looking at longer term is the sulfide expansion. But the oxide expansion has gone well and you'll start to see Safford rates and volumes increasing. We've got that in our forecast for this year. With respect to Jetti and Cory Stevens is on the line and he works a lot on this leach initiative and works a lot with other third parties, including Jetti. I'll let him comment on it. But we're continuing to work internally. We have our own team that is testing additives. We have our own team that's driving these operational tactics that we've been so successful with over the years. But we're also partnering with third parties to share experiences and understand what the art of the possible is with respect to this leaching technology. With respect to Jetti, we did do a trial at Baghdad. This was not a major deal for us. It was a stockpile that we didn't expect to use in the future and it had mixed results. But we're continuing to have dialogue with Jetti about what they may be able to bring to the table. But we're really focused on trying to figure out ways that we can build this on our own because that allows us to retain the economics as much as possible. But we are using relationships that we have with industry participants that will allow us to enhance our understanding and share, share the results that others have experienced and share some of our techniques as well. But Cory, you want to add anything on third party discussions versus our own? Cory Stevens : Yes, no, Kathleen, we're pretty excited about the additives that we have in place play. In fact, we're using an AI model actually to generate candidates. And we have a pretty sophisticated and rapid test method where we go through and qualify candidates for additives and then work those through the system for commercial deployment in a way that we're actually going to go in the next few months and have our first deployment at Morenci at a commercial scale. So we're pretty excited. So much so that we've got other candidates in the pipeline. But we're --we're going in a pace to move forward with a pilot but also scale it across Morenci with the infrastructure. So we're betting on the come that that's going to work and then go. Go big very quickly so that that's what's going on that front. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, Cory. Cory Stevens : Thank you much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lawson Winder with B of A. Please go ahead. Lawson Winder : Yes, thanks operator. And thanks for fitting me in, guys. I appreciate it. And good morning, Richard, Kathleen and Maree. Just wanted to quickly ask on El Abra. So, Richard, you spoke about submitting permits in 2025 back in December or early, actually early November. I think it was just curious, when you think about that project. What do -- you think about the right copper price for that to work and what's the right IRR to justify that investment? And then can we expect a stability agreement as part of the board approval for that full funds decision? Thanks so much. Kathleen Quirk : Well, in terms of the overall economics and we've done a lot of work, given the experience that others have had with recent projects in Chile, we've done a lot of work to test our capital and understand what happened in the other situation to make sure that our economics are robust. And you look at the capital spend here, it's a large number. It would be shared between Freeport and [Indiscernible], but it is below a $4 price. And if you use the same discount rate in the U.S. it's well below $4. But getting the price at $4 would give us a higher rate of return to adjust for the risk that we have at Baghdad and the U.S. In terms of stability agreements in Chile, we'll look at the landscape there. We currently do not have an agreement for El Abra, but we will look at whether that would make sense for this project long term. But we have a while to decide because we'll submit the EIS by the end of this year and then we'll go through a permitting process for a few years with the government and we'll be in a position after that to make a decision. But what getting the permit does is gives us a lot of optionality to have a shovel ready project which are few and far between in this world. So having a large scale project like this permitted will bring great value for Freeport. Lawson Winder : Okay, very well said. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Brian MacArthur : Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Can I just get a clarification on the 7.5% export tax? You talk about the smelter being repaired by mid-year, but you also mentioned you're probably going to pay the 7.5% export tax all through 2025. Is that going to happen even if you get the smelter up and running or is it still working the way it used to work? Where ultimately when the smelter's running, that export tax goes away? Or has something changed in all the negotiations as you work to get your concentrate exports? Kathleen Quirk : Yes, well the current regulation in Indonesia is 7.5% on exports. So we're expecting that the smelter will be started up by the end of June, but then there'll be a ramp up period. So we'll continue to have some exports in the second half of the year, but they will decline significantly as we go through and begin ramping up. So we've got in our cost guidance we have export duties built in on anything we're exporting which is in line with the current regulation. Brian MacArthur : But then in 2026 it would still change assuming the smelter is up and running at full capacity by year end, right? Kathleen Quirk : 2026 is zero. Yes, I mean assuming we have capacity, full capacity and we don't have exports, it would be zero. Brian MacArthur : Great, thanks very much. Kathleen Quirk : Thank you, Brian. Operator : And with that I'll turn the call back to management for any closing remarks. Kathleen Quirk : Well, thank you everyone for your participation, your interest, your good questions and if you have any follow ups. David Joint is available. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",
