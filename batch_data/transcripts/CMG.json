All participants are now in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Thank you. I would like to turn the conference over to Chipotle\u2019s Director of Investor Relations, Alex Spong. You may begin your conference. Alex Spong : Thanks, Rene. Hello everyone and welcome to our call today.

We refer you to the Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated in our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks. I would like to remind everyone that we have adopted a self-imposed quiet period restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period begins on the first day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the second quarter, it will begin June 1st and continue through our second quarter release in July. On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Monty Moran, Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve. Steve Ells : Thanks Alex. Well, I am extremely pleased with our sales performance during the first quarter. We ended 2013 with nice sales momentum and that momentum strengthened in first quarter as our restaurant teams continue to do a great job of delivering our customers who visited Chipotle during the quarter. Our revenues were $904.2 million for the quarter, an increase of 24.4% driven by an increase in same-store sales of 13.4% and from the opening of 44 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings per share of $2.64 for the quarter, an increase of 7.8%. What I\u2019m pleased about is that our constant pursuit of creating an extraordinary dining culture along with the best people culture in the restaurant industry is resonating with our customers, and they\u2019re rewarding us with their loyalty. Our food culture continues to focus on finding the very best ingredients with an eye towards sustainability and great taste and preparing them using classic cooking techniques. This allows us to constantly improve our already delicious food. Our unique people culture is centered around hiring top performers who are empowered to achieve high standards and developing them to be the future leaders of the Chipotle. Although our focus and emphasis on these two key areas is not new. We are more confident than ever that building a strong food culture and a strong people culture is helping us change the way people think about and eat fast-food while leading to significantly better business results. During the quarter, we announced plans to continue to rollout Sofritas. This is our delicious vegan tofu offering and we expect to have Sofritas in all of our restaurants by the end of the year. Sofritas is an organic tofu and it\u2019s braised with chilies, chipotle adobo, garlic, cumin and oregano. It\u2019s been very popular with our vegan and vegetarian customers but we\u2019re delighted that about half of our sales come from customers who are meat eaters. Sofritas is in nearly 1000 restaurants and accounts for 4% of our entr\u00e9e product mix in those restaurants. We continue to make progress on our quest to use non-GMO ingredients in our food. Just over a year ago, we became the first national restaurant company to voluntarily disclose GMOs in our ingredients and about to find non-GMO replacements. Today, we have eliminated virtually all of the GMO ingredients in our food. Our corn and flour tortillas are the only foods we currently serve that are made using ingredients that contain or could contain trace amounts of GMOs and now we\u2019re testing new non-GMO recipes for these tortillas and we hope to be able to roll them out by the end of the year. Removing GMO is just one of the many improvements we\u2019re making as we continue to pursue the sourcing of high quality sustainably graced ingredients. We\u2019re proud of these efforts. And we\u2019re also proud of the marketing which is designed to encourage people to be more curious about their food and where it comes from and how it\u2019s raised. We also want to educate our customers so they\u2019ll appreciate that these better ingredients prepared using classic cooking technique is the reason our food taste so good. Ultimately, it\u2019s our belief that the more people know about their food and how it was raised and where it comes from, the more likely they will be to eat at Chipotle. Farmed and Dangerous is a good example our commitment to entertain while creating curiosity about how food is raised in this country. Farmed and Dangerous is a four-episode satire we produced which ran online on Hulu and Hulu Plus. The day the first episode posted to Hulu alongside some of the most popular television shows, it was among the top five viewed shows. After the first episode was released, the show exceeded Hulu\u2019s audience projections for the entire run of the show and coverage of the show and related issues in the news media generated millions of impressions. So we\u2019re really pleased about the attention that Farmed and Dangerous is getting. But more importantly that it is creating curiosity and spots the dialogue about how food is raised. Another great opportunity to engage people in a celebration and dialog about food is our Cultivate events. Recall that our Cultivate festivals are daylong festivals of food, music and ideas and bring together great bands some of the country\u2019s best known chefs and other attractions. These festivals speak to issues like the difference between whole and process foods, the use of GMOs and the difference between pasture based versus more industrial based animal agriculture. We recently announced that our Cultivate events will be held in San Francisco, Dallas and Minneapolis this year. Last year about a 100,000 people attended Cultivate events in Chicago, Denver and San Francisco but millions of additional consumers were reached through related advertising, social media and PR. We continue to be encouraged by the reach and response of these events with more than 90% of attendees and saying that they would attend again in the next year and would recommend the event of others. We\u2019ll also continue to do more traditional advertising which is designed to keep Chipotle top of mind with our customers. Our new campaign entitle better ingredients is currently running in many Chipotle markets around the country. The creative content focuses on our use of great ingredients and classic cooking techniques and includes print, online ads and outdoor. Finally, we\u2019re encouraged by the growth seeds that we have planted including our international expansion ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale. Since our last call we recently opened our third restaurant in Paris and we now have 10 restaurants open in Europe including six in London and one in Frankfurt. I should remind you however that we review our portfolio of growth seeds as opportunities for long term growth potential and that our growth will be driven by the development of Chipotle restaurants in the United States for the foreseeable future. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mont. Monty Moran : Thanks Steve. I am really proud of the results our restaurant teams delivered during the first quarter. While many restaurants and retailers have talked about a tough consumer environment not because of the weather the type of economy our teams have created such a warm and welcoming environment that our customers visited at an accelerated rate during the quarter. This terrific environment our customers discover when they visit Chipotle is the result of the special people culture our managers are creating in our restaurants. It\u2019s a culture that emerges when you hire only terrific people who believe in and are committed to work Chipotle is having who have a desire to learn how to create delicious food made from high quality ingredients and who drive in a culture when they are empower to contribute to their absolute fullest potential including becoming the future leaders of Chipotle. Of course this is the culture that customers discover when they visit our restaurant to restaurants and every one of our managers throughout the country is intently focused on creating this very same restaurateur culture in their own restaurants. Today we have more than 500 restaurateurs including over 90 in field leadership positions but we have more than 1,200 managers who are working hard to become restaurateur soon. In fact every single one of our managers has targeted becoming a restaurateur within the next 12 months most of them sometime during this year. We know this because the plan tool that you\u2019ve heard me talk about during the past two earnings calls identifies a specific plan of action by which each GM will create a restaurateur culture in their restaurant. These are realistic plans created based on themes our field leaders have identified when visiting each restaurant and meeting with each and every crew member on the team. Executing the plan helps our managers ensure they have the right people on their team but they have a compelling vision that everyone on the team is committed to their culture of empowerment exists in the restaurant and that the entire team understands our high standards. When all of that exist in the restaurant top performers who empower to achieve high standards with a compelling vision that restaurant can count on the visits from Steve or me one of our other officers for a restaurateur interview. I am really excited about the positive impact this planned tools having in creating a clear roadmap for achieving this elite level of restaurateur. I am more confident than ever that our field learners are spending their time wisely and productively by helping to create special people cultures rather than swatting away symptoms. And I am more confident than ever that each of our restaurants has the opportunity to become restaurateur very soon. Each restaurant has already received two quarterly plans and they will receive an updated plan from their field leader each quarter so that they can see the progress they\u2019re making and reducing the amount of negative themes in their restaurants and advancing towards restaurateur. As restaurateur program is the cornerstone of our people culture where our very best managers run extraordinary restaurants and have demonstrated the ability to elevate and develop the people around them. Many of our restaurateurs have expanded their leadership beyond their home restaurant showing they can elevate the people and culture in nearby restaurants and many have advanced into field leadership positions such as ATO where they oversee the cultures and as many as eight restaurants or the team leader where they oversee an average of 12 to 15 restaurants. A few of our restaurateurs have even gone beyond team leader into team director roles with leadership response ability for around 50 restaurants and overseeing over a 1,000 people. And I\u2019m pleased and proud to announce that we\u2019ve achieved the first during this quarter. For the very first time we\u2019ve had a leader who started out his crew advanced to GM then restaurateurs through the field leader ranks to the position of executive team director. Pedro Huichalaf (Ph) is the first person at Chipotle to make the journey from crew member to executive team director and we\u2019re certain there will soon be more. Pedro began working as a crew member in Denver. He proved himself to be a top performer with a knack of making the people around him perform at their very best and became a restaurateur at our Almeida and Logan restaurant in Denver in 2007. In 2009, Pedro was promoted to apprentice team leader, after all three of the restaurants he mentored as a restaurateur become restaurateurs themselves on the very same day. From there Pedro progressed to a team leader position in very short order, in 2012 he was promoted to the team director in Arizona where he helped develop a deep bench of strong future leaders, now he has been named executive team director where we will lead our restaurants in Arizona, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, Portland and Vancouver. We\u2019re extremely proud of Pedro and his accomplishments and are certain that he will have an even bigger impact on the company in his new capacity, where he\u2019ll continue to do what he does best, which is elevate and develop the people around him. Pedro\u2019s story is special in that he\u2019s the first person at Chipotle to make the journey from crew to exec team director, but others are ascending all the time, from crew to restaurant management and field leadership. In fact we recently promoted along with Pedro, four other long time leaders to exec team director positions. Ron Cedio became an exec team directory as did T. Old, Frank Evans and Barry Coke, bringing us to nine executive team directors nationwide and giving us a stronger field leadership team and better development opportunities in markets around the country. Empowered teams of top performers do everything better, they prepare and serve better tasting food, they create a wonderful environment where the restaurant is clean and inviting, they lead a team that\u2019s warm and hospitable and they deliver terrific customer service. One important element of delivering great customer service is you\u2019ve heard us say over and over is faster throughput and once again faster throughput contributed during the quarter as we saw an average increase of seven transactions at our peak lunch hour from 12 to 1pm, and we also saw seven additional transactions during the peak dinner hour between 6 and 7pm with the dinner count during that hour growing faster than the all-day count. And in one of our busiest days of the week, Friday we saw an increase of 11 transactions during our peak lunch hour between 12 and 1pm. Our restaurant teams have focused on great execution of what we call the four pillars of throughput which has once again led to record throughput during the season the first quarter when throughput is historically at a low point during the year. We attribute this better execution to our ability to observe and report on how well each restaurant and each field leader is delivering on each of these four pillars. As a reminder the four pillars of throughput are using a linebacker at peak hours, proper mise en place, having aces in their places and using a dedicated expeditor at peak times. By knowing exactly what\u2019s happening in each of our restaurants and where to focus our efforts to drive better execution and understand what might be holding us back, we have been able to make consistent progress in this very important area of our customer service. Over the past year we\u2019ve seen our execution for three of the four pillars of throughput, that is to say expo, linebacker and mise en place, improved from an average score of around 65% to 70% during the first review to over 90% during the most recent review, so we think our field teams have done a great job focusing on and driving this important initiative over the past year. We\u2019re excited that our teams are ready to break new throughput records in the second quarter of the year, which is typically our busiest time of year and we can build on the throughput momentum that we\u2019ve developed during the past few quarters. Customers in all of our markets except New York City and can now enjoy Chipotle catering and we plan to roll catering to New York City later this year. Catering sales continue to approach 1% of our total sales and we\u2019re optimistic that catering will ramp up in the second quarter with the graduation season approaching. Some more people can have a chance to try it. As we gain momentum with our catering we still think we can get better at improving the program from an operations perspective. While most of our customers really enjoy the customer experience we\u2019re providing with catering we want to focus on making sure that orders are ready on time that they\u2019re sealed completely and accurately and if there\u2019s a seamless handoff to our restaurants from the customer order process. As we continue to execute this program through our high standards, and as more customers discover and experience catering for themselves, we\u2019re encouraged that we\u2019re going to see continued growth in catering. Overall, we\u2019re very pleased with the first quarter and believe that we have the pieces in place both in terms of our food culture and people culture, to continue to deliver a terrific dining experience for our customers and strong results for our shareholders. I\u2019ll now turn the call over the Jack. Jack Hartung :  Thanks, Monty. We\u2019re delighted that more and more people are choosing to visit our restaurants every day, our top performing crews and managers continue to provide an exceptional dining experience to our guests by providing great service and serving delicious meals made from premium ingredients. And this has led to our strong sales momentum which accelerated into the first quarter. Our sales increased 24.4% in the quarter to $904.2 million, the sales increase is driven by a very strong sales comp of 13.4% in from new restaurant openings. We\u2019re very happy to report that the 13.4% sales comp represents the highest quarterly comp we\u2019ve experienced in nearly eight years since the second quarter of 2006. Back then our average restaurant volumes were under $1.5 million while this strong comp has pushed our average restaurant volumes above $2.2 million for the first time. The comp was driven primarily by increased customer visits and while weather in the quarter certainly created volatility we believe there was not a net overall negative impact from weather in the quarter. While sales were understandably down during days of extreme winter weather when the weather improved our sales recovered to a higher level than before the extreme weather for a few days, before settling back into a normal sales trend. The comp also benefited from an increase in the average check of about 2% and we benefitted by about 1% from an extra trading day as Easter was in the first quarter of last year. Average check in the quarter was up from last year due to an increase in side orders mostly chips and guac and extra meat and from an increasing catering. Catering continues to represent just about 1% of sales and the average catering order is nearly $300 so it has an obvious positive impact on the average check. Based on the strong comp momentum, we have increased our comp guidance and now expect our comp to be in the high single-digit for the full year before the impact of any price increase which I\u2019ll talk about a little later. Q1 comp benefited by 100 basis points from initial trading data share, we will lose that day with Easter moving to the second quarter, so there is effectively 200 basis points expected drop when moving from Q1 to Q2 just based on this trading day shift. And comp comparison become more challenging each quarter as the Q1 comp from last year was 1% and a comp momentum increase each quarter to 5.5% in Q2, 6.2% in Q3 and 9.3% in Q4 of last year. Restaurant level margins decreased 40 basis points to 25.9%; the lower margins were driven by higher food cost partially offset by favorable sales leverage in labor and occupancy costs. Operating margins decreased by 150 basis points to 15% primarily from higher G&A costs and lower restaurant level margins. G&A costs were higher by 130 basis points than a year ago, which I\u2019ll talk about in more detail shortly. Food cost rose a little faster than expected to 34.5% in the quarter up 150 basis points from the first quarter of 2013, and sequentially they were up 60 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2013. The sequential increase was due to higher beef and dairy costs and in terms of the year-over-year increase food costs were higher primarily due to inflation in beef, avocados and cheese. Beef prices are expected to continue to move higher as supplier remains tight while livestock producers try to rebuild the herds and recover from two years record droughts. And generally U.S. beef prices has set recent all-time highs. And our steak prices have also hit all-time high recently, rising 11% in the quarter compared to Q4 and despite another 14% in April so far. So our steak is up 25% already since the fourth quarter. Cheese prices are also expected to be up over 10% this year and avocado costs will also continue to rise as we\u2019re just now entering the season of buying avocados from California again. California production of avocados is expected to be down about 30% compared to last year even though demand is expected to increase. And while we haven\u2019t felt the effects of the recent hog virus on the supplier front, supply challenges and pricing pressure may happen later this year. With all of this rising inflationary pressure our food costs will be nearly 36% during April and are likely to push past that 36% over the next two quarter before the impact of any price increase. With all of this food inflation we have seen so far and expect to continue to see, we\u2019ve decided to increase our menu prices. It\u2019s been nearly three years until last company wide price increase and while we want to remain successful to our customers, we need to pass along these rapidly rising food costs. We\u2019re currently reviewing our menu price on a market-by-market basis compared to competitors and based on our analysis so far we plan to increase prices on average somewhere in the mid-single-digits. We expect we will start installing the menu boards with higher prices later this quarter and finish installation by early in the third quarter. Labor costs were 23% of sales in the quarter, a decrease of 60 basis points from last year. Labor leverage was driven by higher sales volumes partially offset by stronger management staffing ratios and normal wage inflation. Our restaurant teams have done a better job of having the right number of staff and managers in the restaurants which leads to developing a stronger pipeline of future leaders as well as better restaurant execution including better throughput. Occupancy cost for the quarter were 6.1% of sales a decrease of 50 basis points from last year due to favorable sales leverage. Other operating costs were 10.5% for the quarter flat as a percentage of sales. Marketing was 1.3% in the quarter and our combined marketing and promotional costs as a percent of sales were the same as last year. Overall for 2014, we expect our marketing expense to be around 1.6% to 1.7% of sales with relatively higher marketing costs expected during the second quarter and third quarter, as we kick off our better ingredients advertising campaign in over 30 markets and over 1,000 restaurants. The campaign will help customers better understand and connect how cooking with natural and high quality ingredients leads to better tasting food. G&A was 7.4% in the quarter up 130 basis points from last year. G&A was higher as a percentage of revenue primarily from higher non-cash non-economic stock comp and from about $2.5 million in higher legal costs in part due to a recent settlement. Stock comp expense was $28 million in the quarter which is up $12 million from last year. For the full year 2014, we expect non-cash stock comps to total about $98 million or an increase of about $33 million over last year. Now this is higher than our guidance than last earnings call of $90 million as the non-cash accounting charge related to stock options increased when our stock price surged after our fourth quarter earnings release but just before the options were granted. The number of options granted has grown only modestly each year but the non-economic non-cash stock comp has increased significantly over the years as a result of the accounting charge being calculated based on our rising stock price. As a result of the higher non-cash stock comp expense and our all manager conference in third quarter, we expect our G&A costs in 2014 to increase about 50 to 60 basis points overall over 2013. Now this is slightly above the 40 basis points increase we talked about in February and that\u2019s due solely to the higher non-cash stock comp I just described. So just one last point about the stock comp, as I mentioned the full year noncash charge will total about $98 million but a disproportionate or about $62 million will be expensed in the first half of the year. This is because of the accounting rules require that we fully expensed the charge for any employee was eligible for retirement over six months rather than amortized the charge over the three-year vesting period. Most of our senior management team qualifies for retirement or they will qualify before the end of the three-year period. During the quarter, average restaurant volumes increased to a new record of $2,226,000 and we\u2019re optimistic that our averaged store volume can continue to improve as more people discover Chipotle and become loyal customers. Our new restaurants continue to perform very well with new restaurants volumes opening at or above $1.6 million to $1.7 million communicated range. During the quarter, we opened 44 new restaurants compared to 48 restaurants at this time last year. And our full year guidance remains at opening between 180 and 195 new restaurants in 2014. Our effective tax rate was 39.1% in the quarter and we expect our annual effective tax rate will also be 39.1% and that compares to 38.7% in 2013. This rate increase is the result of the expiration of the work opportunity tax credit and the R&D tax credit that benefited us in 2013 and is partially offset by a lower estimated state tax rate. Effective tax rate of 39.1% in the quarter is 270 basis points higher than Q1 of last year, as remember last year\u2019s first quarter reflected the tax benefit from the work opportunity tax credit and R&D credit on a retroactive basis for all of 2012. Diluted earnings per share of the quarter was $2.64, an increase of 7.8%. Our balance sheet continues to remain very strong and we finish the quarter with over $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents for the first time ever including short-term and long-term interest-bearing investment and with no debt. We continue to believe the best use of our cash is to invest in our high returning restaurants but we\u2019ll also opportunistically buy participate in share buybacks and we\u2019ll continue to nurture our growth seeds. ShopHouse, Chipotle and international markets and Pizzeria Locale each of which we expect will provide future opportunity to invest in growth. During the quarter, we purchased about $13 million in our stock over 23,000 shares at an average share price of $548. At the end of the first quarter, we still have about $77 million left in our share buyback program previously approved by our Board of Directors and our Board recently approved another $100 million share buyback. Over the past five years, we\u2019ve invested over $622 million to repurchase stock at an average price of $153. Thanks for your time today, and at this point, we\u2019d be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, please open the line. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from David Palmer with RBC. Please go ahead. Eric Gonzalez - RBC Capital Markets : Hi, this is actually Eric Gonzalez in for David Palmer. Congrats on the strong traffic growth in the quarter. We were wondering if you could focus on marketing for a second. You recently mentioned how you were changing your local store marketing efforts and maybe if you could talk about the changes you made and maybe assess what has worked well for you? And then on the digital side, do you expect to increase usage of digital marketing in the near term? Is that something that could be a 2015 event? And then maybe what you've learned on the digital side so far? Steve Ells : So in terms of the local store marketing, we revamped the way we deploy the team. We now have 36 marketing specialist across the country. They each create detailed plans based on the market experiences and the needs of the restaurants. Most importantly though I think most impact has been derived from the marketing specialists spending time with restaurant managers and the restaurant teams developing ways that they can customize programs and reach out directly to individual customers, local businesses, schools, sports teams, hospitals, community events like races, foot races, bicycle races things like this. So there are a number of customized programs that they developed, and then we usually developed custom currency that we can distribute during these events. So it\u2019s not a one size fits all, in fact it\u2019s for a company the size of Chipotle it\u2019s very unique and in that super-super nimble and able to reach out on folks on a very individualized basis which I think has really gone to creating a very, very strong bond and trust with our customers. It reminds me of the way I used to reach out to the local community when I ran just one restaurant. And I think to be able to have 1500 restaurants in United States that act like individual modern hops where the restaurant manager and restaurateur and his or her team can be a part of that community and that fabric just helps to strengthen the specialness of Chipotle.  So on digital, there is really a lot of elements on digital and so I\u2019ll try and touch on all of them. First of all, we\u2019ve always done some marketing on a number of digital outlets. We\u2019re active on Twitter, we\u2019re active on Facebook. We provide digital offers as well. So we\u2019ll continue to do that I wouldn\u2019t say necessarily that will ramp up. But one of the things I think that we\u2019re really proud of is that our marketing has smart conversation. And so when we do things like Farmed and Dangerous so we do things like the Scarecrow, it creates conversation that people are curious about people are interested in. And so we see lots of activity that our customers are engaging in through Twitter, through Facebook, kind of on their own. And so is that really marketing? I guess not technically but it\u2019s really exactly what we intended when our marketing team when Mark Crumpacker and his team come up with things like Farmed and Dangerous it really says very little bit about Chipotle it\u2019s not really marketing in the traditional sense at all but boy oh boy its sparked conversation and that sparked that conversation with social media such as Facebook and Twitter really cascade very, very quickly and so there is discussion about where food comes from and how it is raised. And we have this belief that the more that curiosity is sparked and more than conversation carries on the better it is for Chipotle. And then the final piece here is you\u2019ve heard us talk about we\u2019ve been testing mobile payments opportunity. That\u2019s going well. We expect that we will introduce that to our customers at least in one market, sometime this summer and we think that once we start engaging in a mobile payments opportunity like that with our customers we now have an opportunity to have personalized conversation with them as well and we communicate with them through text messages and through other opportunity once we have kind of this relationship between us and their mobile payments apps. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird. David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird Co.: Good afternoon, and congratulations on the sales momentum here same. May be... Steve Ells : It\u2019s still morning David. David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird Co.: I wanted to ask about may be the cost outlook and Jack I think you mentioned that you\u2019re continuing the effort put pressure on commodity prices you\u2019ve decided to take a price increase. Could you frame up where you think the cost ratio might be heading without that price increase in the second half? I thought you said over 36%. But maybe if you can provide some more granularity on how you think this plays out so that we can model it more precisely. Jack Hartung : Yes we think David that April alone even though we\u2019re not done with the month but just based on the commodity costs we\u2019ve seen so far with avocados are up because of buying from California stake is up for the reasons I mentioned and that\u2019s not Chipotle only thing beef prices in U.S. in general are at all-time highs right now. And so those have really spiked recently. And then based on expected price increases in cheese we think April will be right at about 36% we think we could push in the second and third quarters, pushed half of that hopefully not too far pas that. We\u2019re hopeful by the fourth quarter that will settle a little bit the avocado pricing pressure we\u2019re seeing is more of a cyclical based on buying from California and based on this year in general, supply is going to be a little bit low you\u2019ve heard us talk in the past that avocado supply tends to be in every other year thing that when you have one good year the next year seem to be a little bit light and we\u2019re in kind of that light year this year. So we\u2019re hopeful that the fourth quarter will settle a bit and be something under 36% I don\u2019t think I\u2019d do a very good job of predicting it precisely but I would guess it would be in may be 35% to 36% range before considering the price increase. David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird Co.: Okay, thank you. And then as I think about pricing so you haven\u2019t raised prices in three years and I just want to kind of come back to your long term philosophy on raising prices and what you implement this price increase you could continue to see pressure it seems like on some of these item. So I\u2019m just kind of curious to know how quickly you\u2019re willing to come back to the market on pricing if you needed it in 2015 or \u201916 or is this going to be more kind of an every couple of years type of strategy? Jack Hartung : Well I would say neither David and what I mean by that is we don\u2019t focus very much on the timing and so we don\u2019t kind of think today let\u2019s raise prices and then raising again or let\u2019s raise prices now and not raise them again for two or three years. What we think more about is making sure that we earn pricing power. And if we focus on that, if we focus on creating a wonderful restaurant experience and cooking and serving delicious food that we have the permission to raise prices. And if we know as we do the job with that, then picking the timing of it is less relevant it\u2019s just not that important. And generally we\u2019ve been patient in terms of raising prices we have this luxury of being patient. Now what we seen so far and looking at market by market pricing we believe we\u2019ve got a lot of pricing power, we feel very comfortable that if we raise prices somewhere in that mid-single digit range we still got room. So we\u2019re not going to spend all of the pricing power we built up over time we still have some in the bank. And so if we need to come back at some point in the future let\u2019s say next year we would have the ability to do that and then we will go through the normal process that we go through considering inflation, considering transactions trends, considering remaining accessible because as you know we want to remain accessible to our customers so that everyone can enjoy to dine at Chipotle. We\u2019ll go through that same consideration but the thing that we\u2019re most pleased about is that we have built up quite a bit of information to raise prices and yet we won\u2019t cash in on all that pricing ability, right now. So we\u2019ll still have some in the back. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John Glass - Morgan Stanley :  I was probably trying to find fault in great quarters. But in this case there were I think a number of cost issues and they didn\u2019t just relate to the foods I just want to explore those. First, Jack when you look at the labor ratio your labor dollars per store grew at the highest rate it\u2019s grown in several years, even in other quarters we\u2019ve had very strong transaction driven comp. So was there something unique in -- did we run out of initiatives this quarter, so you\u2019re seeing labor inflation, was there some inefficiencies and sort of what happened in labor this quarter? Jack Hartung :  A couple of things John, one last year we were benefiting during most of the quarters from a reduced over time compared to the year before and so that ran out that ran of course. And so we\u2019re not getting any kind of benefit from doing a better job at managing over time. We had parts of the country mostly in the Northeast that had excessive overtime cost in 2012 and so as we compare it in 2013 and doing a better job in managing over time our labor leverage was better to those quarters, that kind of ran its course. In terms of inefficiencies, we probably have about 20 or 30 basis points or so, in ideal theoretical calculation of what\u2019s possible of additional labor leverage. And the reason that didn\u2019t happen is our teams have been focused on doing a better job at staffing the restaurants. And so if their sales volumes suggest they should have 28 people on their team instead of 24, we\u2019re now doing a better job of getting close to that 28 and are giving down the hours. They are staffing for the four pillars and so we\u2019re doing a better job of having the right number of people on the roster and both at the crew level and at the manager level. So we have a deeper bench of top performers that we now are confident can be promoted up to kitchen manager, service manager, et cetera. And so our teams are better staffed are scheduled and we\u2019re scheduling a full team, especially during our peak hours. And so we\u2019re getting better results and so I will trade that 20 or 30 basis points, that\u2019s theoretical for better throughput for a deeper bench and a fuller staff of crew and managers. It\u2019s possible over time but we\u2019re not going to rush into it, it\u2019s possible over time, we might be able to capture that 20 or 30 basis points. But I would consider that to be a relatively small inefficiency or investment to get the operating results that we\u2019ve seen. John Glass - Morgan Stanley : That\u2019s helpful. And then on the G&A line I think even excluding the stock based comp and the litigation, G&A dollars grew and rough calculation was like still up 30%, no matter if that\u2019s right or not but is there anything unusual of G&A other than those two items that would have grown faster than it will grow through rest of this year? Steve Ells : No I mean we did have, our bonus is up a little bit John probably because the quarter was good, it was up a little bit as a true up from last year\u2019s bonuses a couple of small things here and there. I think if you take out the non-cash stock comp and take out for the full year I am taking about now. If you take out the non-cash stock comp take out the manager conference which will cost $8 million this later year, and you look at it year-over-year. I think we\u2019ll have some slight leverage in our G&A. so I think our spending is in pretty good shape. We have added a number of people to our ranks in the past year to support our growth. But I would say there is nothing out of the ordinary underneath our G&A, it\u2019s still leveraging slightly and overtime, hopefully we\u2019ll have the opportunity to leverage even more as we kind of grow into the recent headcount additions. John Glass - Morgan Stanley : And then just I guess the, does the pricing take care of all this in other words operating margin expand in the back half given food inflation and given all the other things you just talked about enough to do that? Steve Ells : It depends on what happens in the back half of the year but based on our expectations I will expect our margins will expand. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jason West with Deutsche Bank. Jason West - Deutsche Bank :  Jack I didn\u2019t quite hear if you said any sort of update on where things are running in the second quarter, short-term but just what the comparison and 200 basis points on the trading day, just any help you can offer on kind of how\u2019s the second quarter so far? Jack Hartung : In April so far I would say that the underlying trends are comparable to what we saw in the first quarter. And so I think if you take into account that we\u2019re losing a couple of hundred basis points compared to the first quarter in terms of trading day and it\u2019s a tougher comparison. But it you adjust for those, the underlying kind of transactions that I am seeing and the underlying sales that we\u2019re seeing are comparable to the first quarter. Jason West - Deutsche Bank : Great, and then just when you enter the pricing timing, can you run through that just one more time in terms of when the pricing will be fully rolled out to the system the kind of mid second quarter and things like that. Jack Hartung : I would expect it will be fully rolled out to all of our markets by early in the third quarter, I mean I suppose it\u2019s possible we might be able to accelerate and get it done by the end of the second. But I would say by early into third quarter we\u2019ll have new menu boards with new prices in all our markets. Jason West - Deutsche Bank : Okay, great. And then just one other quick one. Monty, you talked about the throughput improvements at peak periods. Can you remind us what your average peak lunch transactions are and peak dinner transactions just so we have kind of a foundation there? Monty Moran : Yes, we talk about specific what those numbers are, but they\u2019re sort of in that between 110 and 120 range during the Friday\u2019s at peak lunch and a little lower than that when you look at Monday through Friday. And that\u2019s for the first quarter we expect that in the second quarter and probably third quarters as well. We will see those increase hopefully even substantially because the first quarter is our slowest time of year in terms of what we would expect in terms of throughput and yet we\u2019ve derived these wonderful throughput improvement where even our peak lunch and dinner hours nearly kept up with all day comp numbers in terms of being able to put more people through at those peak hours. So it\u2019s really difficult in fact in terms of the absolute number we put through. The number of people per hour the day we have bigger games during lunch and dinner than any other time of the day. We have seven more people they\u2019ll be put to the line on average per restaurant during those times of the day when our lines are longest. So we\u2019re very-very proud of our field teams for accomplishing that, but we also know that our field - and our field teams know that now is really when that game begins because now is when our peak season is descending upon us when will be busier and we\u2019ll have an opportunity to really-really hit the ball out of the park on these throughput numbers as we execute the four pillars hopefully as flawlessly as we ever have and thereby giving much-much better customer experience to everybody. So we\u2019re proud of the absolute numbers of I think particularly in light of the fact that the first quarter is not one of the places where we usually set records and we did. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray : Awesome quarter. When you think about catering what kind of customer feedback are you getting? And I\u2019m specifically wondering if you would consider delivery or test it. Steve Ells : Thanks Nicole, and with catering most of our customers comments -- a lot of customers comments are coming in that are just very delighted that we have it in the first place. It\u2019s something less than 1% of comments are still frustrated where they\u2019re being late or things not being put together correctly. And I think that we\u2019re still working out some bugs in that regard but we\u2019re proud generally how our restaurants teams are accomplishing catering. In terms of delivery, it\u2019s not something we\u2019re particularly to get involved with at this point throughout the country with the possible exception as Manhattan, but with really catering right now and our customers are pleased to be built the comment and carry these very - and we package things in a very easy way where our customers can carry even a fairly large catering order out and taken home with them. And I think that while some people would like us to deliver, our fear would be that putting in place at delivery model we change unit economic of the catering program and make is more difficult for us to price it competitively. And I think if you put delivery in, I mean, let\u2019s say one out of ten people would like delivery right now, I think that if you offer delivery, six out of ten might take it. And so I think that something like that and we\u2019re just making these numbers up basically we don\u2019t want put delivery in place and end up costing the ability to be really competitive and to deliver this food to folks at this terrific price in this really fun way. We don\u2019t want to drive the prices up by breaking the unit economics of it. So I don\u2019t think you will see us doing wholesale delivery programming in catering for foreseeable future. Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray : Very helpful. And I also forgot to ask, are most of those catering orders coming in online? Steve Ells : Well, it is a combination of online and also through a call service that we have in place. Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray : Right. Does it -- is it weighted towards one or the other? Steve Ells : It comes to a call center at the third party down there and then they decide -- they pass it onto the restaurant and make sure that it is taken care. Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray : Oh, okay. I just didn't know if there was online. Steve Ells : Catering per se doesn\u2019t come in, we have online orders for multiple orders and Jack is telling me right now it\u2019s coming. So in terms of being able to do online orders for catering that\u2019s still something we\u2019re working on. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Andy Barish with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Andy Barish - Jefferies: A couple of things just wondering your impressions on sort of has the value gap for Chipotle kind of widened, meaning the time you\u2019ve taken between pricing increases has shown up in customers\u2019 perceived value being a lot higher? And then secondly, just on the throughput, again sort of more theoretical, but how are you balancing speed versus kind of the hospitality side of things in the restaurants if you could? Steve Ells : All that\u2019s to the throughput question and pass on to Jack to talk about the pricing value proposition, but with regard to throughput I think the notion of fast throughput somewhat degrading the customer experience is the wrong -- we look at that as being the wrong way to look at it in fact the way we work on throughput it basically to understand that those things that that best in terms of hospitality things like clear communication, great eye contact, friendliness along the line, efficiency along the line, sense of urgency. All of those things are the things that compose a great customer experience at Chipotle. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re so insisting on having top performers in that places on the line and all that. However, not only are those things, the things that generate the best possible customer experience, those same things happened to be the things that generate the fastest throughput. So, I would literally tell you that as our throughput gets faster you can count on our hospitality not only not the grading but actually getting better us having better and better communications and more and more prepared, so that our actions on the line look not hurry, but fluid. And we\u2019re not operating with the sense of panic but rather we have a team of top performers who look very, very comfortable and are very comfortable serving customers. If you look at our fastest throughput in our restaurants in the whole country, those restaurants tend to be the ones that actually have the best customer service. So, if you were to go survey everyone in our lines, they would all want faster throughput. And while occasionally we do get a comment from someone who is perhaps very new to Chipotle says I felt rushed through the line. When we look into those comments and contact those customers it\u2019s almost really never that they were rushed it\u2019s because we did something wrong, we didn\u2019t listen to them carefully or didn\u2019t give them what they wanted, not because of speed, so faster food equals great customer service through and through. Monty Moran : And Andy on the consumer view of the price value, when we dig into why consumers think that Chipotle is a good value sure price is the piece of it but the bigger piece of it is the experience, it\u2019s [indiscernible] who they trust where the ingredients are coming from, they can see the open kitchen and so they feel good about seeing their food made in front of them. And so, and they love the taste of it, of the food. We get lots of comments about how friendly our crews are, how hospitable our crew are and so most of the value comes from the experience. Our pricing certainly is affordable and in fact when you compare our pricing to others in the fast casual (Ph) we\u2019re often cheaper and we should be able to be more expensive because we spend more on our ingredient for sure. But our customers don\u2019t place a big part of the value that they -- value scores that they gave us which are very, very high. A smaller part of that is attributed to price alone which is different than what customers of other restaurants might say. So we feel good that if we focus on the things that we focus on, great experience, great food, great teams they\u2019re creating a wonderful dining experience that our customers will continue to see Chipotle as a great value and they\u2019ll continue to be willing to spend a little bit more money and really it\u2019s just a little bit more money for this wonderful dining experience that we offer them. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Keith Siegner with UBS. Please go ahead. Keith Siegner - UBS: Thank you, and congratulations for the restaurateur that are the ones out there managing that transaction growth on a day to day basis this is very impressive. Monty thank you very much for all the color around the four pillars how this is helping increase serve independent throughput. Asides the four pillars are there other opportunities to grow the transaction how is the users say the online order ahead is this helping contribute to the traffic growth, are there other alternatives aside from just the four pillars it could be an opportunity to keep that transaction growth is that growing? Thanks. Monty Moran : Yes, it\u2019s a great question. I mean we looked at it in different ways over the years. I think when we first really started to put our eyes on throughput in 2006 we were a little I would say a little bit gadget focused. We were concerned about having a second cash register and how that would increase throughput and if you look back corner you will see a comment from me seven or eight years ago stating that the second cash register can increase our throughput 40% and in fact that was true at the time. But then what we started to discover is there were places where we\u2019d add the second register and throughput would go up 40% and we removed the second registered and throughput would stay the same although be the higher. And so we knew there was something more to it. Then later we added cash -- change machines that would automatically dispense the change to the customer and that did increased too further bit because it took a second or two or three of the job that our cashier had to do and so that was an effective thing. And then we try to handheld ordering system which is still in operation in few restaurants. But what we kept finding is no matter how much of the sort gimmicks we added or how much we used, tried to use technology to increase our throughput nothing could compete with the restaurants that had I guess I\u2019ll say two things. One is having a restaurant tour team, having a team of all top performers who are empowered to achieve high standards. To make a long story short, great teams are just faster and better. But another thing was the teams, the best of the teams that we\u2019re aware of and efficient at implementing these four pillars of throughput and so as we started to notice that the four pillars dwarfed any other efforts that we put in place to increase throughput we decided that has to be our focus particularly because we still have a significant number of restaurants but don\u2019t consistently execute the four pillars. There are some other things though that we\u2019re looking at one I guess credit cards continue to be a more and more significant part they grow in terms of the percentage of our transactions that are paid from their credit cards and that helps us because credits cards are still faster than cash. And we\u2019ve done a lot to make sure that that\u2019s true over the years and making sure that the time between swipe and a print out of the receipt is very, very fast and now it\u2019s just a few seconds at Chipotle. And as you know we don\u2019t require signatures except over a certain dollar amount, so that\u2019s up. I think also through online ordering that gives us a great opportunity to increase throughput as well because we prepare those orders on our second line and when those folks when they come in they are not in our main line and so that allows us the throughput to go quicker. So certainly online ordering is an ongoing opportunity that we\u2019re consistently working to increase. So those are number of things, I think also in time we\u2019ve worked of course the technology to make credit cards go faster, taping the credit cards and what not. So anyway there is a lot of things we\u2019re focused on, but I think you\u2019ll see for the foreseeable future execution of these four pillars will be our top priority while I should say the second priority, the first priority is sending a restaurant team carried off. Operator : Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from Nick Setyan with Wedbush Securities. Nick Setyan - Wedbush Securities :  I want to ask a question on the minimum wage specially in California, I mean ex pricing how we should think about that impacting the labor line going forward and there is another one coming next year again plus we have the healthcare headwinds kicking in little bit more. Maybe you can just kind of remind us what the impact we should expect? Jack Hartung : Yeah the California minimum wage this summer is going to increase to $9 and it\u2019s actually not next year it\u2019s two years from now in 2016 we\u2019ll increase again to I believe to $10. We have already being paying, we\u2019ve always been above minimum wage, we have been hiring in California between $8 and $9 and starting at the first this year, we\u2019ve been hiring at $9. So we\u2019ve already been kind of early adopting this first, until there is very little effect I would call it at a companywide level negligible effect. There will be a bigger effect when the minimum wage increased to $10 in California in a couple of years, but even that is in the range of few million dollars not tens of million dollars. So we can certainly absorb that. And I am sorry, Nick what was the second part of your question? Nick Setyan - Wedbush Securities : It\u2019s the healthcare impact, if you guys could remind us what that is expected? Steve Ells : So the healthcare impact, that will depend -- we are planning on offering healthcare to all of our hourly crew that meets requirements that work to 30 hours or more per week, which most of our crew more than half of our crew do work more than 30 hours, we\u2019re planning on offering an insurance plan, a credible insurance plan to those folks. What we don\u2019t know is how many will accept it. Our estimates is that this will cost somewhere around or below 1% of sales. But we won\u2019t know that for sure until we offer insurance and then we can see how many people adopt it versus how many people decide not to take the insurance. Nick Setyan - Wedbush Securities : Got it. And I am just shifting a little bit on the unit growth side. Are you guys seeing more opportunities with some of the construction increasing, I know in the past that\u2019s been a little bit of the limit on how fast you can add new units, but does seem like it\u2019s becoming a little bit more of the tail wind. So can you potentially see the unit growth or the additions at least increase little bit going forward? Steve Ells : I mean right now what gives us great optimism is the fact that impact from new restaurants is very, very low; it\u2019s below 1% and has been below 1% every year for quite some time. And so in terms of the pipeline of new restaurants that we\u2019re able to find and build we have a significant new pipeline and believe we\u2019ll be able to level our restaurant openings throughout the rest of this year, and which will put us well on Phase 2 to hit the numbers that we\u2019ve suggested that we\u2019ll hit in terms of new store openings. So we feel very, very good about that. Now in terms of being able to accelerate that number, there is always a possibility to accelerate that number and what we always do is sort of balance the quality the real estate we\u2019re able to find with our ability to have great people to run those restaurants and we\u2019re feeling as I talked about during my opening comments we\u2019re feeling very, very good about the pipeline of leaders that are moving up to the ranks. And the probabilities having even faster pace of restaurant development due in large parts of use of the plan tool and our use of that device to help people make sure they have plans in place. And so the people pipeline we feel is really strong, the real estate pipeline is very strong. I think you\u2019ll see us continue to be careful and measured in terms of how we add restaurants, so we continue to add these joyful new store openings that deliver great customer experiences. Operator : Thank you. And we do have time for one final question. We\u2019ll take our last question from Matthew Difrisco with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi this is Katherine in for Matt here and thanks for taking my question. I just have a question on the G&A line, I think you said it will be up 50 to 60 bps but you\u2019re keeping the 90 million non-cash stock based comp. So since you have higher in 1Q, does it mean it will be evenly spread out meaning lighter in the reaming quarter. And then also can you talk about the litigation cost, like what\u2019s in it? And then should we consider as a one-time nature? Jack Hartung : So on the non-cash stock comp, and it\u2019s actually 98 million in total for the year, 28 million hit in the first quarter, 62 million will hit in the first half of the year that means 34 million will hit in the second quarter and that will level up to around 20 million in third quarter and around 50 million in the fourth quarter. And so by the time we get to the fourth quarter the non-cash stock comp is close to half of what it was in the first quarter, so that\u2019s why G&A in the first quarter is quite high, but it will level off over time and normalize over time and keep in mind that\u2019s all non-cash to journal entry you know those amounts are never paid and so but it spread unevenly throughout the year and then your second question I\u2019m sorry was\u2026 Unidentified analyst :  It\u2019s on the allocation. Jack Hartung : We\u2019re not going to comment on specifically what that was about, we did have more activity during the quarter and so we don\u2019t feel like the activity that happened in the quarter will be something that will occur, litigation is hard to predict perfectly but we do think that the quarter was a little bit unusually high and we would hope that it would settle back down to normal charges for the rest of the year. Unidentified analyst : Okay, if I can just have one more follow up, can you talk about the volume that you\u2019re seeing in ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale and also the international. Steve Ells : When I comment specifically you know, the volumes there\u2019s lots of - actually it\u2019s really important about Pizzeria Locale above ShopHouse and Chipotle international and the volumes is just one of them. What I can tell you is that the volumes for all of our proceeds they\u2019re behaving similarly in general to how we saw Chipotle going into early markets back when Chipotle was kind of unknown, you know back in the early 2000 or so, and so there\u2019s a discovery process and so restaurants don\u2019t open up at the same levels the Chipotle in US does but as the discovery process happened we\u2019re seeing more and more people come in, we\u2019re seeing the traffic increase and we\u2019re seeing patterns that are very similar to what we saw with Chipotle in the early days and we find that to be very encouraging and so, but we\u2019re not disclosing volumes, that\u2019s just one very small piece, one little sound bite of everything that we\u2019re looking at in terms of the quality of the food, the quality of the people, the quality of the customer experience. So we\u2019re not talking about specific volumes. Alex Spong : All right thanks everyone for joining, and we\u2019ve exceeded our time for the call but we thank for joining us and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thanks everyone. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation.",

All participants are now in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like introduce Chipotle\u2019s Director of Investor Relations, Alex Spong. You may begin your conference. Alex Spong : Thank you. Hello everyone and welcome to our call today. By now you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the second quarter 2014. It may also be found on our Web site at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include projections of the number of restaurants we intend to open, conference comp sales increases, the impact of menu price increases, trends in food costs, marketing spend and other expense items, effective tax rates, stock purchases and shareholder returns, as well as other statements of our expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today and we are not assuming any obligation to update them. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. We refer you to the Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated in our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks. Our discussion today will also include Non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation of which can be found on the presentation page of the Investor Relations section of our Web site. I'd like to remind everyone that we've adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period begins on the first day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the third quarter, it will begin September 1st and continues through our third quarter release in October. On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Monty Moran, Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve. Steve Ells : Thanks, Alex. Well, I am extremely proud the performance our team has delivered during the second quarter. Not only were we able to continue the momentum we saw in the first quarter and late in 2013, we actually accelerated our momentum in the second quarter. Our revenue for the quarter grew to $1.05 billion, an increase of 28.6% and was driven by same store sales increase of 17.3% and the opening of 45 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings per share of $3.50 for the quarter, an increase 24.1%. Our ability to generate such strong sales growth is the direct result of our restaurant managers and crews providing an exceptional dining experience, which keep the customers coming back and allows us to build such a strong customer loyalty. Ultimately our performance comes down to our continued focus on strengthening our unique food culture and our special people culture. Our food culture starts by finding the very best ingredients we can, with an eye to sustainability and great taste and continues by teaching our teams how to turn these high quality ingredients into delicious food using classic cooking techniques. We are confidently elevating and challenging ourselves to find even better ingredients and better cooking techniques so that the food we serve in the years to come is even better than it is today. Through our people culture, we are developing the future leaders we will need to achieve our vision to change the way people think about any fast food. This starts by hiring teams of all top performers and empowering them to achieve high standards. The strength of our people culture is what allows us to provide such extraordinary customer service and maintain such strong unit economics. During the quarter, we took some important steps to strengthen our food culture and improve the quality of the ingredients we use in our restaurants. From many months now, we have struggled to get all of the beef we need from cattle raised without use of antibiotics for added hormones which is the cornerstone of our meat and dairy verticals. When we have not been able to get enough beef that meets our high standards, we have temporarily filled that gap with conventionally raised beef and posted notices in our restaurants so customers are aware of the change. With the nation's beef supply at a 60 year low and our demand continuing to rise, it looks as if this challenge is going to continue and we want to find a better solution, one that allows us to source as much beef as possible that meets our high standards. We believe we found that solution by sourcing some grass fed beef from Australia, a country that is ideally suited to raising beef cattle entirely on grass. We started doing this in recent months to help to fill the gap between what\u2019s available and what's needed to meet our growing demand. The meat produced by these ranchers is grass-fed in the truest sense of the term : The cattle spend their entire lives grazing on pastures or rangelands, eating only grass and forages. All this beef meets or exceed the protocols we apply to our domestic responsibly raised beef, including that the animals are raised entirely without antibiotics, added hormones or other growth promoters and by ranchers whose practices are aligned with our standards for humane animal husbandry. While our loyalty to American ranchers remains strong and a significant majority of beef continues to come from American ranchers, sourcing some grass-fed beef from outside the U.S. is an important step in Chipotle\u2019s never ending food with integrity journey. In the short run, the grass-fed beef we are using from Australia will supplement the responsibly raised beef we have been purchasing from around the U.S. Overtime we hope that our demand for grass-fed beef will help provide an opportunity for more American ranchers to adopt a grass-fed program and help term grass-fed beef into a more mainstream product in the United States. We look forward to working with our supplier partners to meet this challenge. During the quarter we also saw the beginning of the summer growing season around the country and with it the start of our local produce program. This year our goal is to use at least 20 million pounds of produce from farms that are within 350 miles of our restaurants. Restaurants throughout the country may serve ingredients such as romaine lettuce, bell peppers, red onions, jalapeno peppers, oregano from local farms. We are also able to serve locally grown avocados, citrus or cilantro in some parts of the country where it\u2019s possible to grow these ingredients. Our commitment to serving locally grown produce is ultimately about serving the best tasting food we can. Quite simply, produce from local farms can arrive closer to the time it is harvested and results in fresher produce but there are other benefits as well including a reduction in food miles and economic impact to rural communities throughout the country. We are also making progress with the roll-out of Sofritas, our vegan menu item made with braised organic tofu. As of now Sofritas is available in about 1,000 restaurants. When we introduced Sofritas, our aim was to create a dish that would appeal to not just vegan and vegetarian customers but all of our customers and that is very much what we are seeing right now. So now Sofritas account for about 3.5% of our entrees in the restaurants where it\u2019s available. And what\u2019s exciting is that we are finding Sofritas is been ordered by people who normally eat meat. Barring any supply limitations, we expect to have Sofritas in all of our restaurants by the end of the year. While our food culture is one of the key drivers of our business, many customers, including a number of our own customers do not fully understand the issues of the food system that still heavily influences the decisions we make. One facet of our overall marketing program is aimed at encouraging people to be more serious about their food and where it comes from. We believe that the more people understand these issues, the more they will make better choices about the food they eat. Through our day long food and music Cultivate festivals and through programs like our recent online satire series Farmed and Dangerous or short films such as last year\u2019s Scarecrow, we look to draw people into the conversation about food and where it comes from in a way that makes them more curious about the food they eat. We just held the first of three Cultivate festivals planned for this year in San Francisco with the remaining events scheduled for Minneapolis and Dallas and the response was great. Our research shows that attendees loved the overall experience including the music, celebrity chef demonstrations, the Artisan food and brewer halls and the attractions designed to educate people about issues around food. And that an overwhelming majority of them would attend the events again. Two of our most recent content marketing programs Farmed and Dangerous and Scarecrow were just awarded 12 Lion awards between them at the Cannes Lions, the world\u2019s largest competition for creativity and communications. While we don\u2019t produce these programs to win awards, the awards demonstrate the breakthrough of these produce programs and the response customers have to them. These programs have been very effective tools for us to engage with people in way that is first and foremost entertaining but that also makes them more curious about the food they eat. A part of our larger marketing program which also includes traditional advertising and local market programs, this approach is helping us build our brand in a more unusual way than traditional fast-food formula which relied heavily on price promotions, limited time offers and other gimmicks to bring customers in. We believe that our approach to marketing helps us build a deeper relationships and loyalty with our customers rather than just driving transactions in the short-term. To keep our restaurants top of line, we continue our traditional advertising through the quarter. Currently we have national and local advertising focused on communicating the use of better quality, responsibly raised ingredients that are prepared with care. Response to our advertising is encouraging with most of the recent research showing the increase in ad awareness and purchase intent during the campaign. This advertising will continue to run through much of the summer and into the fall. The progress we are making on our journey to change the way people think about and eat fast food is defining Chipotle in terms that unique within the industry and allowing us to provide exceptional returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Monty. Monty Moran : Thank you, Steve. It makes me proud to see our restaurant teams deliver these spectacular results in the quarter at a time when our customers have more dinning choices than ever before. Yet more and more customers are choosing the Chipotle because the top performing managers and their crews provide an exceptional dining experience that keeps our customers coming back and leads them to tell others about their fondness for visiting in Chipotle. We have amazing people culture and the foundation of that is a group of terrific people who all believe in the same dining principal, that each of us will rewarded based on our ability to make the people around us better.  Our people are committed to our mission to change the way people think about meat fast food and they understand that the only way we will accomplish this is to have a special culture, a culture of top performers, who are empowered to achieve high standards. This is the restaurant true culture. It is the focus of every focus of every person in this company, enabling us to create a terrific dining experience and produce outstanding results.  The strength of our culture allows us to have exceptional customer service, delicious food and an inviting atmosphere in our restaurants, all of which leads us to a strong unit economic model, while also setting us up for continued success, because these top performers strictly rise into broader leadership positions within the Company. Throughout the quarter we continued to promote new restaurateurs, the elite managers who best demonstrate what our culture is all about. If you include field leaders who have come through The Restaurateur program, those who have been promoted to a prior team leader or team leader even team director positions, we have more than 525 of these extraordinary leaders now overseeing about 70% of all of our Chipotle restaurants.  During the quarter, we also saw some significant progress of Restaurateurs moving into field leadership positions. We promoted five field leaders to team director positions. Jason Oaks, Karen Grayhall, Ben Castillo, Peter Garllio [ph], Emily Amdares [ph]. And with these team director promotions, we also promoted nine leaders into present team leader positions. So all of us continue to build and strengthen our people culture. We\u2019re going to host our All Manager Conference in September and as we host every two years, to help educate and inspire our restaurant managers and field leaders of teams.   This year\u2019s All Managers Conference will include all of our GMs, restaurant stores, field leaders and many people from our support departments as well some key suppliers and partners. In all, there are around 2,500 people who will attend the conference to support our commitment to building culture of empowered top performance. The conference provides one of the best opportunities for our teams to learn more about how we plan achieve our mission to change the way people think about and eat fast food and how they can rise up to be the leaders that are going to take us there. This year\u2019s conference will feature members of our leadership team discussing our vision, the importance of our people culture and unit economic model. We also help our managers develop and strengthen their culinary capabilities, teach them to create Restaurateur cultures, teach them to recruit, hire and welcome only top performers and teach them more about why food integrity is so unique and important. We will also introduce them to the ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale restaurants. Finally we\u2019ve also added an award ceremony this year celebrating some of our team members who have made outstanding contributions to Chipotle\u2019s culture. These people continuously raise the bar in our performance and we are excited to allow their stories to be an inspiration to the rest of the audience of aspiring Restaurateurs.   If past conferences are any indication, I am certain that this will leave our more passionate about our vision, more knowledgeable about our business and more committed to developing the people around them and strengthening the culture in their own restaurant and with a stronger belief in what we can all accomplish as a team.  Over the years, I believe the All Managers Conference has been one of our best tools to educate and inspire our managers and to send all of our teams away with every new sense of purpose. While we continue to build better historical cultures in our restaurants, we are very encouraged by our teams arising to meet challenges.  One of the key operational advantages that we constantly seek to improve is our throughput. Good throughput is one way of providing great customer service and it\u2019s also well with our team to have top performers and power to achieve high standards. So it\u2019s a great sign that we were once again able to make substantial gains on this important measure of great customer service during the quarter. This quarter we posted increase of eight transactions during the peak lunch hour and eight additional transactions also during the peak dinner hour compared to last year.  What\u2019s truly impressive is that even though we have long line to both lunch and dinner, we are able to drive a 9.4% transaction comp during our peak lunch hour and a 13.3% transaction comp at our peak dinner hour through better throughout. These are the customers who might easily walk away from our long-lines to dine elsewhere except that they know that our excellent teams are geared up and ready to serve them a delicious meal quickly. Overall, we would not be able to achieve such phenomenal same store sales without these dramatic improvements in throughputs. We believe the improvements we are seeing in our throughput is a result of just a few key things. First, having more top performing managers and teams. We know from experience that top performance get more done in less time than low performers and hold themselves to a higher standard. Second, by focusing on the four pillars of great throughput, using a linebacker during peak hours, proper mise en place, having aces in their places and using a dedicated expert during peak times; and third by auditing and reporting our field leaders how well their teams are executing the four pillars and how they can improve. Of course great throughput does more than move people to our restaurants. It also translates into better customer service since the same thing that leads to great throughout also creates a very nice customer service and make our customers happy. Our performance for the quarter also benefitted from growth of our catering business. For the quarter, catering sales were 1.6% of revenue, compared with about 0.3% a year ago same quarter and catering sales benefited by around 50 basis points in the second quarter from the seasonal nature of the stronger sales we have in May and June for special events like graduation parties. In markets we're catering as an operator for at least a year, sales continue to build and averaged about 2% in the second quarter. We're encouraged to see catering continue to grow and that we\u2019re building greater customer awareness and customer loyalty over time. Finally I\u2019d like to provide a quick update on our development plans. We remain very much on track to deliver within our guidance to open a 180 to 195 new restaurants this year and we have a very solid pipeline of potential sites going forward. We expect that about 70% of our restaurants this year will be in proven markets, with about 15% in developing or established markets and another 15% in new markets, including locations in Duluth, Texarkana, Mobile and Charleston, West Virginia. Looking forward we have a strong pipeline of potential sites going into next year and beyond. Overall we\u2019re very pleased with the quarter and our performance year-to-date and believe that we have pieces in place both in terms of our food culture and our people culture to continue to deliver an exceptional value experience for our customers and strong results for our shareholders. With that I'll now turn the call over to Jack. Jack Hartung :  Thanks, Monty. We\u2019re pleased to report another quarter of very strong financial results. In fact our second quarter results represent one of our strongest sales comps as a public company, second only to the first quarter of 2006, our very first quarter as a public company. Back then had under 500 restaurants averaging about $1.5 million in sales and while the 19.7% comp back then was impressive, we\u2019re even more proud of the 17.3% comp this quarter, considering we now have nearly 1700 restaurants, averaging $2.3 million in sales. In fact on an annualized basis a 17.3% comp would result in adding an incremental sales layer that is nearly equal to our entire company sales back in 2005, the year before our IPO. But more importantly than the comp itself is that we achieved this result by continuing to focus on building a special food and people culture and a strong business model, which results in providing exceptional dining experience to our guests and creates shareholder value for our investors. Our comp of 17.3% in the second quarter helped to elevate our average sales volumes for restaurants opened for at least 12 months past $2.3 million for the first time, and the comp also helped push our sales above $1 billion in a quarter for the very first time. Overall sales for the quarter increased 28.6% to $1.05 billion, driven by the comp and from new restaurant openings. Year to date sales were $1.95 billion, an increase of 26.6%, including a comp for the year so far of 15.5%. The quarter comp was primarily driven by an increase in customer traffic, along with an increase in our average check, which includes a 2.5% benefit from our menu price increase rolled out during the quarter. Average check in the quarter was up about 5% from last year with half of this increase coming from the menu price increase and the rest of the check increase coming from catering, an increase in the group size per transaction along with additional sides such as Chips & Guac. Our total online catering and fax orders reached an all-time high of 6% of sales in the quarter with catering adding about 1.6% of sales. Seasonally the second quarter is now strongest for catering orders as Chipotle\u2019s been a big hit at the graduation parties this time of year. So while we\u2019re pleased to see catering rise to 1.6% of the quarter, it\u2019s likely that it will taper off in the next few quarters. Our objective in raising prices was to pass along some of the inflation we absorbed over the past three years while continuing to charge fair prices in order to remain accessible or affordable to our loyal customers. We thought a very thorough process and reviewed our menu prices on a market-by-market and item-by-item basis, compared ourselves to local competitors in each market and considered the amount of actual and expected inflation for each of our ingredients and other factors such as the cost of doing business in each market. Because we rolled the price increase throughout the quarter starting in late April and finishing in late June, the effective price increase of 2.5% in the quarter reflects only a partial impact. The actual average increase was about 6.25% to 6.5%, based on the assumption of little or no trade down or resistance. Though the average increase was 6.25% to 6.5%, the increase varied by market and by menu item. So for example, because of the significant recent inflation in beef and expectation that beef prices will remain elevated for the foreseeable price, steak prices were raised by about 9% on average, while chicken prices were only raised about 5%. We expected some customers would trade down from steak to chicken as a result of a higher steak premium and we have in fact seen some customers shift from steak to chicken. Aside from the slight shift from steak to chicken, our customers have generally responded well so far, but it is early and we\u2019ll continue to watch for resistance in terms of fewer customer visits as well as customers trading down. We\u2019re pleased to see our strong underlying sales momentum continue into July. The comparisons are tougher in the second half of the year as we compare two comps of 6.2% and 9.3% for the third and fourth quarters respectively. So we expect our underlying transaction comps be lower in the third quarter and fourth quarter because of these tougher comparisons. But assuming we experience little or no price resistance, we still expect comps well into the teens for the rest of this year. As a result, we\u2019re raising our comp guidance and now expect our sales comp to be in the mid-teens for the full year. We opened 45 new restaurants in the quarter and 89 for the year so far, which brings our total company wide restaurants to 1681 at the end of Q2. We still expect to open between a 180 and 195 restaurants for the full year as our development pipeline continues to look very solid and we continue to see an uptick in new construction with about 54% of our mix being in new construction in 2014 versus just 43% last year during 2013, and that\u2019s helping our real estate team to find attractive new locations. Our new restaurants continue to perform well very and as a result we now expect opening sales volumes in the $1.7 million to $1.8 million range, which is up from previous range of $1.6 million to $1.7 million. These new restaurants opening volumes along with our current count trends and strong margins allow us to strengthen our already industry leading unit economics and returns. Restaurant level margins for the quarter were 27.3% or a decrease of 30 basis points from last year, and year-to-date margins were 26.7%, which also decreased by 30 basis points. Higher food cost and higher marketing cost more than offset favorable sales leverage in labor and occupancy lines for both the quarter and for the year. Our food cost in the second quarter up 10 basis points sequentially from Q1 as the menu price increase had the effect of reducing our food cost by about 80 basis points in the quarter. Despite the menu price increase, our food cost were 150 basis points higher than Q2 of last year due to higher cost for our beef, avocados and dairy. Sale prices leveled off a day after peaking in April and May, but they remain at an elevated level compared to last year or 20% higher due to limited supply from some of the smallest herd sizes in over 60 years while demand for beef remains high. So we expect elevated steak and barbacoa price to continue for the foreseeable future. The net food cost for 34.5% which is up 150 basis points from last year. We expect underlying food cost before the benefit of the menu price increase to remain pretty stable over the next two quarters. But since the next two quarters will benefit from the entire menu price increase, food costs should be about 100 to 130 basis points lower than in Q2, depending on the effect of any product mix shifts. Labor costs were 21.8% of sales in the quarter, a decrease of 90 basis points from last year and year-to-date labor costs were down 80 basis points. Labor leverage was driven by higher sales volumes, partially offset by stronger management and crew staffing ratios, which contributed to some labor efficiencies along with normal wage inflation. Occupancy cost declined 50 basis points from last year for both the quarter and the year due to favorable sales leverage. Other operating costs increased 40 basis points from last year from higher marketing promo and fund raiser costs. Marketing cost increased to 2% of sales in the quarter, compared to about 1.5% last year, and combined promo and fund raiser costs were about 20 basis points.  We expect marketing to be about 1.6% overall for 2014 and will remain elected in the third quarter as we continue our better ingredients advertising campaign across the country in over 30 markets and 1000 restaurants. The campaign will wrap up in most markets by October and will help customers understand that the use of sustainably raised high quality ingredients, which are prepared with care result in a more wholesome and better tasting meal. Other marketing events will also include our Cultivate festivals that will be held in Minneapolis in August and Dallas in October. In the quarter, G&A was 7.1% of revenue, higher than last year by 90 basis points. The increase was primarily due to higher non-cash, non-economic stock based compensation expense and to a lesser extent from higher bonus cost. Stock comp was about $34 million which is up $15 million from last year, a small portion of which is in the labor line. The increase over last year is due mostly from higher stock price along with more of the senior management team qualifying for retirement, which accelerates the expense recognition. The second quarter also includes a catch-up for long-term incentive performance shares of about $1.6 million. These performance shares which were issued in 2013, by now expected to be fully realized during the earn-out period based up our strong financial performance to day and where we project to finish at the end of the three-year measurement period. As a perspective, our underlying G&A without the stock comp was relatively flat at 4.1% in Q2 of this year compared to 4% last year. G&A costs for the first six months of 2014 were 7.3% of revenue, an increase of 110 basis points, and again was primarily due to the higher non-cash, non-economic stock based compensation expense and to a lesser extent from higher bonus cost. Year-to-date non-cash stock comp was $62 million, which is up $27 million from last year, and again the increase over the last year was mostly due to a higher stock price and more of the senior management team qualifying for retirement. Stock comp is still expected to be around $98 million for the full year, which means it will decline significantly over the next two quarters. As a result, although G&A year-to-date is 7.3%, we expect to finish the full year under 7% of sales. The third quarter will include our biennial All Manager Conference event, which will cost about $9 million and will include around 2500 Chipotle employees, including all of our GMs and all of restaurateurs. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 39.1% for the full year and we expect the rate to also be around 39.1% and that compares to the 38.7% rate in 2013. This rate increase is the result of the expiration of the work opportunity tax credit and the R&D credit that benefited us in 2013 and is partially offset by a lower estimated state tax rate. Diluted EPS for the quarter was $3.50, an increase of 24.1% from last year, but our underlying economic earnings growth is stronger than implied in EPS growth as our net cash provided from operating activities grew by 35%. And of course of earnings growth potential is even greater considering we have absorbed three years of food cost inflation, while less than half of the recent menu price increase has flowed through in the current quarter. So we're pleased that our business model is stronger than it\u2019s even been and we continue to have the ability to add significant additional shareholder value in the future. During the quarter, we repurchased over $37 million of our stock or over 72,000 shares at an average share price $517. This is more than triple the number of shares purchased in the first quarter as we were opportunistic when the share price declined early in the quarter. At the end of the second quarter we had nearly a $140 million less than our share buyback program previously approved by our board. And over the past five years we\u2019ve invested over $650 million and purchase over 4.1 million shares at an overall average price at about $159 a share. We finished the second quarter with over $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents along with short and long term interest bearing investments and no debt on our balance sheet. We continue to believe that the best use of our cash is to invest in our high returning restaurants and we\u2019ll continue to develop additional growth options by planting seeds including ShopHouse, Pizzeria Locale and Chipotle outside of the U.S. and we expect each of these proceeds will provide attractive value enhancing growth investments in the future. In the meantime we\u2019ll continue to optimistically repurchase our stock to enhance shareholder value. Thanks for your time today and at this time we\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, please open the lines. Operator :  Absolutely. (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Joseph Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  I guess the question about the transaction can increase being so strong, I know a couple of quarters ago you spoke about new diagnostic tools to help the multi-year supervisors analyze restaurants and help the managers become restaurateurs faster. Is that kicking in in a significant way, or are there other factors that you'd point to when you look at the tremendous transaction growth? Steve Ells :  Thanks Jo. I\u2019d say it is kicking in, in the sense that when -- if you look at my opening comments, I talked about how a number of things are moving throughput and as we always say that the most powerful thing we\u2019re doing to move throughput along is just having more restaurateur teams and more teams of really top performing teams that were super-super empowered and so that\u2019s kind of number one. I would say that the restaurateur diagnostic tool that we rolled out is one of the very powerful tools that's helping our field leaders connect very directly with managers and helping those managers understand very clearly what they need to do in order to develop those teams with top performers that are very, very empowered. So the teams in our restaurants are getting stronger as a result of that tool and are much more aware of what the opportunities are for them and as they build stronger teams, that's the number one thing adds horsepower to our ability to generate great throughput. But on top of that, we continue also Jo to measure the incidents by which we\u2019re achieving the four pillars of throughput in our restaurants. So we have reports to go out to our field leadership that let them know how their batch of restaurants is doing in terms of achieving the four pillars. And that continuous measurement and awareness on the part of our field leadership has really helped them to continue to move the needle on transactions. So I would say those two things are the things that have helped us the most in continuing to improve and feed up in terms of that very important aspect of our customer service. Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Is your peak hour throughput at all-time record levels now? Steve Ells :  Yes, it is. We\u2019re the fastest we've ever been at lunch time and at dinner time but the average throughout the entire day are speeding up as well. So we always talk about lunch and dinner because that\u2019s the time that it\u2019s hardest to speed up but the reality is the percentage comp that we\u2019re getting at the other times of day that aren\u2019t peak lunch and aren\u2019t peak dinner are actually better. So during the shoulder hours, after lunch and so forth, we\u2019re actually getting a better comp than our comp during those periods of time, but we\u2019re very pleased that lunch and dinner are still moving on at a clip that's very near our overall comp. Operator :  We\u2019ll take our next question John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. John Ivankoe :  If the question was on advertising and promotion; firstly if you think you have the optimal spend or it might be a potential for you spend more money in the future -- it's hard to imagine but you get an even bigger sales lift than what you\u2019re currently getting. And that's a question not just in terms of the awareness of what makes Chipotle special differentiated to your existing customer but how big of a addressable customer market do you see out there that currently maybe hasn\u2019t experienced Chipotle, which presumably might do so under the influence of marketing. JPMorgan:  If the question was on advertising and promotion; firstly if you think you have the optimal spend or it might be a potential for you spend more money in the future -- it's hard to imagine but you get an even bigger sales lift than what you\u2019re currently getting. And that's a question not just in terms of the awareness of what makes Chipotle special differentiated to your existing customer but how big of a addressable customer market do you see out there that currently maybe hasn\u2019t experienced Chipotle, which presumably might do so under the influence of marketing. Steve Ells :  John, we have our Chief Marketing and Development Officer, Mark Crumpacker here today who can answer that question directly. Mark Crumpacker : Sure John. With regard to the marketing spend, I think it\u2019s pretty well optimized but our marketing doesn\u2019t rely on typical promotions and new menu items like most fast food restaurants do. So the type of advertising that we do is just top of mind awareness which we do at about 34 of our main markets around the country and that\u2019s done through billboards and radio ads and there's really only still much of that type advertising that\u2019s needed to raise the awareness to the level that we want. The real heart of our advertising lies in the other activities which are our local marketing program which are getting people into the restaurants through fund raisers and our cultivated better world marketing, which is where we\u2019re really connecting with people on a more emotional level that really creates long term brand value. So we really like the balance that we have between those things with regard to the spend. To answer the second part of your question, we think there is a big market of people that have not either been to Chipotle or don\u2019t come to Chipotle regularly. When we do our research, we find -- it always surprises us because the brand enjoys really high general awareness. We're always surprised at how few people really are regular customers and so there is a tremendous amount of upside for us but as I mentioned earlier our strongest marketing is the type that connects with people emotionally and so we're going to continue to invest in the type that we think is going to create word of mouth, so that one customer tells their friends and so on and so forth and that we really think is the best approach. Operator :  We will go next to Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo. Jeff Farmer \u2013 Wells Fargo :  Just following up on that theme there, I was curious if you guys could share with us how your demographic has changed over the last several years across age and many other relevant metric and just along the same lines, getting to John\u2019s question, I\u2019m just curious if you guys have an accurate read on our frequency trends from some of these core guests? Are they doubling down on their visitation? How should we think about again some of the heart of that traffic increase over the last couple of quarters? Steve Ells :  Well, with regards to our demographic, we haven\u2019t seen a large shift. At Chipotle of course, we have a very, very wide range of folks that come in to the restaurant. One thing that I have noticed in the research lately is that we've had an improvement in the team market across all different economic backgrounds. So we have strengthened and are actually according to our Piper Jaffray survey, the most popular brand with male teams, which is up from the same quarter a year ago. So of course we are really happy about that because those young kids become lifelong customers and they bring their kids and their parents and their friends and their parents to the restaurants as well. What was the second part of your question? Jeff Farmer \u2013 Wells Fargo : I am sorry, read on frequency in terms of core customer. What that's looked like over the last several years if you're seeing that number increase pretty materially? Steve Ells :  Actually we haven\u2019t seen a huge increase in frequency of our core customer. What we have seen is increase in the types of customers that are coming in as I mentioned earlier. We are doing better with the team market. And we think what\u2019s happening is we're actually just expanding our customer base overall and I can\u2019t contribute to significant increase in frequency from a core audience. Operator :  We take our next question from Jeffery Bernstein from Barclays. Jeffery Bernstein - Barclays:  Just a question as we think about the units and talking about the strong pipeline in \u201914, I think you said 70% of those units are going to be proven markets. Just wondering as you think out, now that we're more than halfway through \u201914, as you look to \u201915, it sounds like that pipeline continues. I\u2019m wondering whether as you look at it, what the limitation might be or if there is none at all? Obviously you want to maintain a steady pace but I\u2019m just wondering whether people or real estate that would be the gating factors just as you consider, the strong acceleration and traffic trends that we have seen? Steve Ells :  Well, yes. Those are both the gating factors and we actually talk about it more than you would imagine in terms of which might be the gating factor and I think that we feel really good about that type of real estate we're seeing out there. Like Jack said we were staying at 53% to 54% of our restaurants are now in new construction and that number has been ticking up over the last I would say prior eight to 12 quarters. And that enables us to find more real estate. And that being said, there is more competition for some of those new sites that are coming out and so that's something that we're always watching. But I think another thing that we keep finding is -- and we found this to our A model strategy but we find it now as well, is that Chipotle is welcome more places, in more locations than we ever would have though before and so we are able to take a little bit more risk in going into some trade areas that are a little bit off the beaten path. And so when we look in the outer years, I think we are at a higher confidence level than we have ever been in terms of Chipotle\u2019s ability to be successful in all of the markets throughout the country and beyond, even places where -- that just weren\u2019t on our radar screen a few years ago, some of which I mentioned in my opening comments as some of our new markets for the next year, excuse me, for this year and the next year. So, we are able to go further and further afield, and of course, that brings up the issue about how we're doing on the people pipeline and right now our ratios of field leaders to restaurants is lower than it's been before and what I mean is that each field leader has fewer restaurants they're overseeing. I think for a while our field leaders got stretched a little thin and now we've reversed that trend by promoting a lot of people from within and also hiring some others on to that team and so that\u2019s been I think a good move which is helping get more attention to the development of managers from crew positions who will be able to help carry us forward. So it\u2019s a constant struggle to make sure that we're pushing forward responsibly on the development of leadership which we're always doing as best we can and also sort of pushing to find the very best real estate we can, but not pushing so hard that we would compromise our standards in terms of the type of restaurants we like to open. But I think given the new unit volumes that Jack referenced in his opening comments, those new store opening volumes are very, very impressive, higher than they've ever been. And that gives us -- that along with the kind of teams we're seeing in our restaurants gives us confidence that we're developing Chipotle and opening new restaurants at a very responsible pace. So while we won\u2019t say what we're going to do in the outer years yet, we feel very optimistic about our chances of continuing to build growth in a very strong way. Operator :  We will take our next question from Sara Senatore from Sanford. Sara Senatore - Sanford:  I just have a couple of follow-ups. The first is on sort of thinking through the comps. You talked about some of the marketing and clearly I think the catering and also obviously throughput. So people are coming because the lines are shorter. But one of the things that I think we heard from Jack is this idea that it's compared to a tougher sales momentum. Adjusted for that we wouldn\u2019t expect transaction comps to be the same. I think we have kind of heard something similar in many of the recent quarters and I'm just trying to understand if it\u2019s kind of natural conservatism or if we should be thinking about a driver that is somehow different in the coming quarters versus what we have seen really accelerate traffic in recent quarters, be it marketing or may be the ability to just improve throughput, maybe it gets somewhat diminished. So, just trying to understand if you could drill down a little bit more into the transactions and how to think about them? Steve Ells :  Yes, I will start with the last part of your question where you said -- where you sort of made this assumption that the gains and throughput might diminish over time. I tell you, I don\u2019t accept that as being something that\u2019s going to be true in the near or even medium term, perhaps not even in the long term. And we've been able to continue to improve throughput now consistently and I think that as I said earlier in response to your question, the things that drive throughput the most are more restaurateur teams and better teams in the restaurant and also really measuring and teaching our field leadership about which aspect of the four pillars of throughput they might be missing out on. So, I think there is a lot of room to grow that and one thing that gives me confidence about that is when we measure our 15 minute transaction counts, that which we can achieve in our restaurants during a 15 minute period rather than a whole hour, that number is higher. If you multiply that times four to cover a whole hour it\u2019s much higher than our average throughput number is, which shows that every restaurant basically has a skill to deliver throughput at a much higher level than they are currently doing. And so the fact that our restaurants have that skill and the fact we continue to see those numbers increase makes me confident that throughput is something we can improve on for a long, long, long time but that\u2019s only one aspect of what makes up our comp and certainly an important one but you mentioned other things, catering, marketing. May be Jack can talk about the rest of your question. Jack Hartung :  So, I think the essence of your question is, is our comp forecast too conservative because we're saying that we would expect the underlying transaction to decline as we go up against tougher comparisons in the next two quarters. The challenge with predicting what our sales are going to be, what are transactions are going to in the future, is as Mark mentioned we don\u2019t have things like limited time only. We don\u2019t have special promotions. We don\u2019t have new products. So we don\u2019t have anything that we say okay, in the third quarter, in the fourth quarter, we're going to do something, some kind of a gimmick or some kind of marketing emphasis to try to get people in. So we would tell you that we'll continue the momentum. And we don\u2019t spend a ton of time, I will tell you, trying to predict what the sales are going to be. We spend most of our time trying to engage with our customers, trying build the strongest teams we can to create empowered cultures in our restaurants, so that when marketing encourages people to come in to restaurant, when a friend say hey, you ought to try Chipotle and when new customers show up at Chipotle, that they have an extraordinary experience and if that happens they are more likely to come back. Now, I hope that we end up talking a quarter or two from now and we look back and say, yes, it turns out it was conservative. But for us to say that we will continue momentum on top of the 6.2% in the third quarter, the 9 point something percent in the fourth quarter would be difficult to do at this time. But it\u2019s more of a math challenge because of the way we do our business than anything. Sara Senatore - Sanford: Okay, and just, what if I could throw in one question about ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale. Does the fact that your core Chipotle business is so strong and you are working so hard to get the right people in place, does that have any impact on your ability to grow those or if they can all be kind of grown at the appropriate pace at the same time? Steve Ells :  It really doesn\u2019t impact our ability to grow the teams at those restaurants. When we opened the first ShopHouse and subsequent ShopHouses, we did initially seed them with some of our very talented restaurateurs and crew from Chipotle. But really most of those people hired as brand new employees to ShopHouse other than a few of the top management people. The same is true with Pizzeria Locale. It\u2019s a group of people who, for the most part have never worked at Chipotle. And so these concepts like Chipotle Europe as well are all seeded initially with a few Chipotle people but really are growing it completely in an organic fashion, all striving towards that restaurateur culture and all trying to hire top performers who they believe can be the future of their restaurants. So, you can look at every single restaurant we opened. Each and every one is a potential sort of people thump to create leadership for the rest of the organization and so growing more restaurants really doesn\u2019t diminish the amount of leaders we have but gives yet another opportunity to increase the amount of leadership we can choose from. Operator :  We will take our next question from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer & Company. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Company:  Jack, you talked about the opportunity to accelerate EPS growth as the pricing, the full effect of the price increase rolls in starting in the third quarter. You\u2019ve got a bit less than half of the benefit from your pricing rollout this quarter. Obviously, you start getting the full benefit starting in the third quarter. And you talked a little bit about the food margin dynamic. I think you said 100 basis points or more benefit in the third quarter versus the second quarter. But can you just walk us through the other line items within the four walls? And as we think about the 27% restaurant margin you put up this quarter, maybe you can help us craft and understand how that changes as the full effect takes place starting this quarter? Jack Hartung : Yes, it depends Brian on if we see any resistance. So if we see any resistance in fewer customers coming or if we see customers trade down, where they're not buying as many sides, now buying as many drinks, not buying Chips & Guac. So far we're pleased with what we\u2019ve seen. We haven\u2019t seen much trade down. We\u2019ve seen -- in my prepared comments I talked about the fact that we\u2019re seeing some -- a slight shift from stake to chicken. But if that continues, we still have another -- I guess it\u2019s between 3.75% and 4% additional effects of the menu price increase. So if there is no more trade down and let\u2019s say at that 3.75%, you could see another 250 basis points, maybe 275 basis points in additional margin. So if you take all the rest of the line items, you could see some significant additional margin. I mentioned in just the food alone. But the rest of the P&L is leverageable as well as the rest of the menu price increase flows through. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Company: So not to be overly bullish here, but you do see an opportunity in the past to get to 30% restaurant margins, sometime in the second half, possibly by 2015? Jack Hartung : If all goes well. Right now our projection is that we\u2019re not going to see much more food inflation that we're not going to see much more in terms of trade down, either loss transactions or trade down because of the price increase. And so if we don\u2019t see anything unusual that happens over the next few quarters, yes, just the pure math of allowing that price increase flow through is going to push us up close to if not at 30%. That\u2019s definitely a distinct possibility. Operator : We will take our next question from David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird. David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird : My question is really about some of the commentary you made earlier on the unit growth and Monty, I think you mentioned that you are finding new places that you never considered going in the past that are working now. So I was wondering if you\u2019ve given any recent thought to what the long-term unit opportunity for the Chipotle in the U.S. is? I now you had stated some goals around the time of the IPO, but it sounds like you might be thinking something higher than that at this stage. Monty Moran : Yeah, David, afraid to bore you with my answer because you've heard it before. It really hasn\u2019t changed much and that is that given the numbers we came up with, just extrapolating from how we view the top 150 metropolitan statistical areas even at the time of the IPO, those numbers get pretty quickly up in that sort of 104,000 sort of restaurants. And we do believe that we can build a lot of restaurants in the market that weren\u2019t on that top 150 metropolitan statistical areas that we started to do so. But we don\u2019t spend a lot of time modelling exactly how many there could be because that number of 4,000 plus restaurants, that\u2019s a number we guided towards this year of 180 to 195. That's sort of 15 to 20 years out. So obviously there is a lot of room for growing at that pace before we\u2019d ever get near that number. But I would tell you that I have a level of confidence without having going out and done a study as to whether that number is another 500 or another 1,000 more than we used to think it was. I think we that we have a lot of confidence that as we approach -- as we get closer and closer to that number that will be a moving target because the acceptance of Chipotle\u2019s brand has exceeded all of our expectations and I would say that in terms of -- if you look at some of the markets that we used to call developing markets and in fact the markets that we even thought were failing markets to be quite honest like California some years ago, California went from a developing market to a never mind we won\u2019t build in California market and then overnight became a proven market and now is the state in which we have more stories than any others -- far more stores than any other state and it kind of feels like shooting fish in a barrel. We seem not to be able to miss in California.  So that surprise was wonderful. But we\u2019ve seen that same thing happen in a lot of other markets throughout the country that used to be relatively weak for us, markets like Indianapolis and some of the markets in Ohio that are now on fire that we used to think were mediocre and in Indianapolis where we now have better than average unit volume restaurants which was something that we used to think was not really working for us because among other things Qdoba had gotten there many years before us and had quite a few restaurants before we put our first. And so it's just every market that we\u2019ve been concerned about historically has with the passage of some time and often not much time become a market that not only aren\u2019t we concerned about but becomes market that becomes a huge development market for us and obviously Californian being the most powerful example but there are dozens of others. So rather than model exactly how many restaurants that can be, we derive huge confidence in going into these markets that used to be developing markets and just hitting the ball out the park and having great volumes markets, like Philadelphia I\u2019m just thinking, where we went in sort of a little nervous at first and now doing really, really, really well. So, yes we feel good about where we\u2019re going and we don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s anything in our way in terms of being able to grow at a sensible but also speedy pace over these next years and we\u2019re excited about what we can accomplish. Operator :  We\u2019ll take our next question from Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray. Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray :  I was hoping you could touch on the new formats or format that you have, the opportunity to open some equipment improvement you\u2019re making, lead certifications, things of that that nature. I\u2019m trying to understand if you view those as defensive maintenance like investments or if potentially there's a consumer facing nature to those investments and maybe that\u2019s also helping drive traffic. Can you help us think about that please? Jack Hartung :  Nicole, this is Jack. So when you say new formats, can you clarify what you mean by that? Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray :  For a while now you could have a smaller format, different configurations, upgrades, things of that nature. Jack Hartung :  You mean like a model? Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray :  Yes. Jack Hartung :  We\u2019re giving a lot of thought to that and I think one thing that\u2019s generated some of those thoughts is some of the higher occupancy costs that we see in Europe and how it may be prudent for us to try to take some much smaller pieces of real estate in France or England where the occupancy cost is super, super high. And we\u2019re looking at some sites right now in the United States as well where these stores would be really, really, really small and where we\u2019d very-very seating and I think that there\u2019s a number of reasons why we think that that is a good idea, one of which is that, whereas we used to be mostly a dine-in restaurant 14 years ago, and I'd say about eight years ago we were 50-50 dine-in, take-out, now we\u2019re about two thirds take out. So I think that the seating component of what we do has become a little less important as more people know who we are and also we\u2019re more comfortable with it now, now that the brand has been more established. So we aren\u2019t as worried about -- we aren\u2019t as concerned about someone coming in and not getting \u2018the full Chipotle dining experience\u2019 of being part of the restaurant atmosphere. So, we feel good about the idea of going out and building some really, really small scrappy restaurants and we will continue to experiment with that in the future and see how those might give us yet another way to grow sensibly and quickly in some of our markets where other real estate proves difficult to find. Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray :  And then just kind of as a follow up or a part B, maybe just to clarify the other part of my question is do you get credit; for example having a lead certification. I\u2019m just picking out one thing but much like food with integrity, do you see building with integrity as something that\u2019s influencing customers that you could point to and say we see this as something that they care in helping us drive trends. Is it something that shows up yet? Monty Moran :  Not really. I think that we do a lot of these things, from food with integrity to the way we think about -- the way we build our buildings and to the way we think about just doing the right thing by way of our people culture and the way we select our leaders for our company. All of these things are things we do because we know that they\u2019re the right thing to do. Food with integrity was something we put a lot of effort, a lot of investment, lot of passion into, way before there was any evidence that anyone cared about it -- or was it a majority of people cared about. And I think that to the extent we got research back from our marketing team, it still shows that there are a whole bunch of people, probably the majority of people who come to Chipotle who, while they might think it\u2019s nice to have, it\u2019s not central to their decision to eat with us. But this is why our marketing team has worked so hard I think to just start to celebrate some of these points of differentiation and start to generate more and more conversations about where Chipotle\u2019s going, and what we\u2019re doing differently than other companies. And so while we don\u2019t get credit on any given -- I don\u2019t think on any given day for all of a sudden, hey they\u2019re doing great with lead certification, they\u2019re building their buildings more carefully and even food with integrity. We think it\u2019s the right thing to do and we think as people get to know us in a deeper and deeper way and our marketing team\u2019s done a great job of accomplishing that, it\u2019ll be something that either causes more word of mouth about Chipotle, which will lead to additional visits or will just delight some of the people who have already loved Chipotle because it tastes good and they think it\u2019s a good deal. As they find out that we\u2019re doing things that are really special, it will just generate even more loyalty from them and even more excitement when they talk to other people who maybe haven\u2019t tried Chipotle before. So I would say we don\u2019t do any of those things because we think it drives immediate benefit to us in terms of sales. I think we do them because they\u2019re the right thing to do and I think we\u2019re getting better and better at having Chipotle and our core values understood more broadly and as that happens I think that we will see more and more people coming to us for that reason. Operator :  And we will take our final question from Jason Left with Deutsche Bank. Jason Left - Deutsche Bank :  Just a couple of cost related questions, first with some of the shifting of the beef supply overseas, can you talk about how that may affect your cost structure on the food side and there\u2019s more products that you\u2019re looking at to move to international markets and then secondly on the outlook for incentive comp, if we should be planning for that to be somewhat different next year in a way that\u2019s structured at maybe lot lower costs or is it too early to say on that? Monty Moran : No, I think what we're really doing on the beef side of things just trying to get the right beef into our restaurants that we feel good about from the Food With Integrity standpoint and the move that Steve discussed during his opening remarks with regard to getting an amount of Australian grass-fed beef as they move towards sustaining and increasing our ability to have beef that we\u2019re very, very proud of in light of not being able to enough that meets our protocol domestically. So it is not going to cost more at this point if there is not increase cost from that. So we would not suspect that'd be something that would give us pressure. Jack Hartung : And Jason on the comp for the next year, our comp, that\u2019s in hands of our comp committee. They have been meeting to consider the vote from last year and what they would like to do with that. So that\u2019s in their hands. So nothing to report at this time. Alex Spong : All right, thanks everyone. We have exceeded our time for the call but we appreciate and thank you for joining us and we look forward to speaking with you net quarter. Monty Moran : Thanks very much. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation.",

All participants are now in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Thank you.  I would now like introduce Chipotle\u2019s Director of Communications, Chris Arnold. You may begin your conference. Chris Arnold : Hello everyone and welcome to our call today. By now you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the third quarter 2014. It may also be found on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements about our business model and consumer trends and how those may influence our results in the future as well as projections of comp restaurant sales, the number of restaurants we intend to open, the impact of menu price increases, trends in food, labour, and G&A costs, effective tax rates, stock repurchases and shareholder returns, as well as other statements of our expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today and we are not assuming any obligation to update them. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated on our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks. I would like to remind everyone that we have adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period begins on the first day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the fourth quarter, it will begin December 1st and continue through our year-end release.  On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Monty Moran, Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Crumpacker, Chief Marketing and Development Officer. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve. Steve Ells : Thanks Chris. Well I am extremely pleased with our performance during the third quarter. We have continued the momentum we build through the first half of the year growing revenue to $1.08 billion for the quarter, an increase of 31.1% on same store sales growth of 19.8% and the opening of 43 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings per share of $4.15 for the quarter, an increase of 56%.  These results would be remarkable for any restaurant company but for Chipotle where we are now more than 21 years old with more than 1700 restaurants and average unit volumes of more than $2.4 million, we think they are extraordinary. While our performance has been particularly strong this year, our results have been solid throughout our history as a public company even through the depths of the recession and I am often asked how we continue to perform so well. The fact is there is no great mystery to it. Our ability to generate such strong sales growth is the result of our commitment to serving the best tasting food we can. Food that is made with ingredients from more sustainable sources and prepared using classic cooking techniques, and our commitment to having teams of top performers in our restaurants who are empowered to provide an extraordinary customer experience.  It is our focus on these two key areas that will allow us to achieve our vision to change the way people think about any fast food. This formula is unique in the world of traditional fast food in some very important ways. The traditional fast food sector has traded food quality and taste for low cost and ease of preparation. It has aggressively marketed low prices to entice customers to visit more often which has resulted in the need to reduce cost by cheapening ingredients and by compromising the overall dining experience. We have not made these compromises because our fundamental belief is that in order to provide an extraordinary customer experience you cannot take shortcuts. We have shown that we can spend more on ingredients not less and charge a fair price and at the same time, generate outstanding business results. That we can prepare food using classic cooking techniques in each and every one of our more than 1700 restaurants and have consistency. That we can provide great service and still be fast. That we can have teams of top performing managers and crews cooking in the restaurants and still maintain an efficient labor model. Rather than compromise any of the important variables involved in running restaurants, our decision is to deliver all of them and it allows us to create an extraordinary experience that is unique to Chipotle.  This formula has worked extremely well for us since the very beginning and others are starting to notice. A July survey of fast food customers asked more than 32,000 participants who reportedly ate at more than 96,000 fast food meals at 65 chains to rank restaurants based on the quality of the food and the experience. Chipotle topped the list, while traditional fast food restaurants where ranked near the bottom, with customer citing uninspiring food as the primary reason. Despite offering dollar menus and frequent discounts, many of these chains also scored poorly in terms of value. The bottom line customer wants delicious food, served quickly and in interactive format and they are increasingly unwilling to compromise.  Perhaps not surprisingly this survey found that younger consumers, the millennial, where more inclined to skip traditional fast food in favor of restaurants like Chipotle. Food industry research indicates that millennial are turning away from traditional fast food in favor of better food and a more enjoyable experience overall. They are more concerned with how food is raised and prepared than previous generations and are willing to seek out and pay a little more for, something they recognize as better, better tasting, better for the environment and better for their wellbeing.  Investment analyst research also shows similar results. Over the last decade there has been a noticeable shift among consumers away from traditional fast food and casual dining chains, to fast casual restaurants as customers are looking for better quality food, served in a convenient format. The companies that have lost the most customers over the last decade are traditional fast food chains, while the biggest gains go to fast casual restaurants. Chipotle tops the list of restaurant companies gaining customers during this time period. These trends are validated looking at the performance of Chipotle and other restaurant companies.  Our business is thriving posting the same-store sales increase of 19.8% for the quarter and 17% year-to-date. At the same time, traditional fast food companies are struggling to produce positive same-store sales growth at all. The gimmicks that have driven the fast food sectors for years, dollar menus, limited time offers, and merchandizing partnership are not producing results like they used to as consumers simply want better tasty nutritious food at a more compelling experience not gimmicks. In some cases, these other companies are looking to revamp their branding efforts to change their customer's perception but not the food. Fundamentally these are short sighted reactions that seem out of touch with what customers want, better food and a more compelling dining experience. This is exactly what we offer at Chipotle and we think its replicable with other kinds of cuisines. We are in the early stages of developing two new fantastic restaurants, what we call our growth feed concepts, ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen and Pizzeria Locale. Using the exact same model that has driven Chipotle's success, each of these concepts shares our commitment to using only the very best ingredients, the classical cooking techniques, and to building cultures of top performers who are empowered to achieve high standards.  During the quarter we opened another ShopHouse, the eighth one in the Washington DC area. ShopHouse very much reminds me of Chipotle when I opened the first one of the restaurants. It is food that is new to many of our customers but they love it and are thrilled to enjoy a meal that is flavorable, skillfully prepared, and served in a way that is accessible and affordable. At the beginning of this month we also opened a second Pizzeria Locale in Denver. Pizzeria Locale was developed by two extraordinary restaurateurs', Executive Chef Lachlan Patterson and Master Sommelier Bobby Stuckey and we have partnered with them to bring the Pizzeria Locale experience to more customers using the same format that has worked so well for Chipotle.  More than ever I believe this is the new fast food model. Increasingly consumers want what Chipotle is doing and they seem to be turning away from traditional fast food in favor of better food and a more compelling experience. That is what drives our business and continues to provide outstanding results for our shareholders and will continue to be our primary focus. I will now turn over -- turn the call over to Monty. Montgomery F. Moran: Thanks Steve. Now that our vision of changing the way people think about eating fast food, no other results we are producing would be possible without our teams top performers who are empowered to achieve high standards. We have totally changed the traditional fast food formula which depends on constantly lowering costs and simplifying the tasks in the restaurant to the point where they are essentially fool proof. Instead we are creating rewarding environments with skilled teams who do work that they are proud of.  We ask more of our people, not less and reward them with greater opportunities when they step up to meet the challenge. This is one of the many areas where Chipotle is unique within the industry and we are performing well because we have so many sharp performers who are committed to achieving our vision and to providing an extraordinary restaurant experience. At the end of the quarter we had our All Managers Conference in Las Vegas. This conference which we hold every two years is a powerful way for us to teach and inspire our restaurant managers and the teams that they are building to raise the bar and to share more of our vision, changing the way people think about eating fast food. The conference also allows us to introduce new tools that helps our managers up for success.  This year's conference focused on our vision and the importance of our food culture, people culture and unit economic model. Presentations to our managers highlighted many of our accomplishments. We discussed the importance of ingredients that are raised with respect to the environment, animals, and the farmers who produce them. We emphasize the importance of developing extraordinary leaders and how that is critical for our business. And we explained our strong unit economic model and why it is so important for our managers to remain focused and disciplined in protecting it and how they run their restaurants.  We also use the conference to introduce new tools that help better set our managers up for success. One promising development in this area is a new tablet based training system that we are just starting to roll out in our restaurants. This new tool allows us to compile all of our training materials including text and video in a single place that can be quickly and easily updated and accessed immediately in many of our restaurants or offices. We introduced this new system at our Managers conference and are just beginning to roll it out to restaurants now but are optimistic that this new system will improve upon our already successful training programs. Ultimately better training programs help us improve how we develop people and teach specific skills. In turn this will help us deliver a more consistent restaurant experience.  Finally we also used the conference as an opportunity to introduce our concepts, ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale to our employees. Each of the new concepts had exhibits at the conference that were designed to resemble the actual restaurants. The people running each concept first provided a thorough overview of each restaurant to all of our managers and guests and then served food allowing everyone to see and taste for themselves just how delicious these restaurants are. This was the first time most of our employees had tried either of these restaurants and they were very excited. While most of our growth will continue to be driven by opening and improving our Chipotle Restaurants, we felt it was a great time to introduce the opportunities that these concepts will provide to our teams as our operations teams will ultimately play the most important role in helping them expand.  While we believe the conference is enormously valuable to our managers, it is also incredibly inspiring and powerful to us. The conference provides a clear and strong picture of the movement we are creating. There were nearly 3000 inspired top performing employees as well as valued suppliers at the conference, each committed to helping us achieve our vision. Being part of that is a powerful experience for all of us.  During the quarter, our efforts to build and strengthen our cultures continue with the addition of 41 new restaurateurs. We also promoted 27 of our existing restaurateurs into our plus positions, and 15 restaurateurs into more senior field leadership positions including four new team directors. Because of the success that these extraordinary leaders have had developing the people around them we paid out nearly $700,000 in the quarter in people development offices and nearly $2 million year-to-date.  These bonuses are paid specifically when restaurateurs develop crew in the management positions. As the rank of restaurateurs continue to grow, so does their reach. These extraordinary leaders now oversee more than 70% of all of our restaurants. This is important and the restaurateurs and their crews delivered a compelling dining experience that keeps our customers coming back. Our unique people culture is an area where Chipotle excels and that has contributed significantly to our overall performance. One area in particular where we have seen tangible benefits in these special cultures is in the area of our throughput. Our teams are continuing to increase the speed of service we provide and by doing so are providing a better customer experience. During the quarter, throughput remained strong and actually got stronger with an increase of six transactions during the peak lunch hour and six transaction during the peak dinner hour compared to the same time last year. We would not be able to achieve such extraordinary same store sales increases without these continued improvements in throughput during our busiest hours. The improvements we are seeing in our throughput is a result of having more top performing managers and teams that can make sure that we have the four pillars of throughput in place. Using a line linebacker during our peak hours, having proper mise en place, ensuring there are only aces in their places and using a dedicated expedited during peak hours. We have proven that we focus on these four pillars, we can serve more customers and provide a better experience. So for this reason we measure our effectiveness in this key area as well as provide bonuses to our field teams in part based upon their ability to execute these four pillars. Finally I would like to provide an update on development. While we expect to end this year with total new restaurants openings at the high end of our guidance at 180 to 195 new restaurants. For the year about 70% of these locations will be in proven markets with 15% new markets and 15% in established or developing markets. Going forward we believe that we are well positioned to continue to find excellent real estate. While the market overall has become more competitive for the kind of sites we are looking for, Chipotle remains very desirable tenant with strong financials. Given the strength of our position, we expect to open between 190 to 205 new restaurants in 2015, which will include a small number of grocery (ph) restaurants. We expect to see some pressure on rents in major markets, but think that we can offset some of that, with a strong supply of new smaller retail strip centers. In many cases, we are able to find developers who are willing to build 2 or 3 tenant strip for our use and believe that there continues to be great opportunities ahead in some of the smaller, more remote markets that are bit underserved, places such as Corpus Christi, Texas or Greenville, North Carolina where you recently opened restaurants.  We have the right pieces in place, the right food culture, people culture and unit economic model to continue on our path to change food culture and we believe that our success in doing that, will allow us to generate outstanding returns for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Jack Hartung. John R. Hartung: Thanks, Monty. Our teams top performers continue to provide an incredible dining experience to our customers and our ongoing commitment to using the very best ingredients for our food has continued to bring more customers through our doors. We are very happy to announce another great quarter with strong financial results.  Last quarter we reported our second strongest sales comp as a public company and this quarter after 21 years in business we are delighted to report an even higher third quarter sales comp of 19.8% making it the strongest sales comp since becoming a public company in 2006. It's really quite an achievement and we are proud of these results, proud of our results, which are driven by our unique food, our unique people, and our strong business cultures. Our third quarter same store sales comp of 19.8% has helped to drive average sales volume for the restaurants that have been open for at least 12 months to an all-time high of $2.4 million. Overall sales for the quarter increased 31.1% to $1.08 billion driven by the comp of 19.8% which includes the full impact of the menu price increase along with new restaurant openings. Year-to-date sales were just over $3 billion, an increase of 28.2%.  The quarter and year-to-date comps sales increases are driven by increased customer visits along with a higher average check. Our average check in the quarter is up about 8.5%, driven primarily by an effective price increase of about 6.3% as well as from catering and a slightly larger group size. Although our menu prices increased, we continue to see very strong transaction growth and we are experiencing very little price resistance, just under 1% so far with very little menu trade down. We are delighted to see that the price increase we had to take after 3 years of absorbing food inflation had little or no effect on the strong customer loyalty we have worked so hard to build.  It confirmed our belief that our customers understand and appreciate our focus on sourcing high quality ingredients and that they see tremendous value in the dining experience, they enjoy at Chipotle. We will continue our focus on developing teams of top performers who are empowered to achieve high standards as we know these strong comps are not possible without them. Our teams freshly inspired by the themes presented at our All Managers Conference will help continue our success and achieve our mission of changing the way people think about and eat fast food. Though we will finish this year comparing to a higher comp of 9.3% in the fourth quarter of last year, we continue to expect comps for the full year of 2014 will be in the mid-teens. Of course 2015 will bring even tougher comparisons especially in the second half of the year. We expect full year comps in 2015 will be in the low to mid-single digit range and will decline beginning in the second quarter as the menu price increase begins to cycle off.  Our new restaurants continue to perform very well and we still expect strong opening sales volumes in the $1.7 million to $1.8 million range or higher. What we are most pleased with regarding our new restaurants is that we continue to staff them with terrific leaders and teams of empowered top performers delivering the same incredible dining experience that our customers have come to expect. This allows us to continue to grow while delivering industry leading unit economics and returns for both our existing and new restaurants.  Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $4.15, an increase of 56% from last year. We were able to grow EPS and nearly double our sales growth rate despite higher food costs as we delivered sales leverage on the labor and occupancy lines. Our operating margins were up 250 basis points to 19.1%. Our restaurant level margins were up 200 basis points compared to last year to 28.8% due to our strong transaction trends and the benefit of the recent menu price increase. Year-to-date diluted earnings per share was $10.29, an increase of 29.8% over last year. Restaurant level margins year-to-date was 27.4%, an increase of 50 basis points due to higher comps offset by higher food costs. Food costs are 34.3% in the quarter down only 30 basis points sequentially from Q2 and food costs were up 70 basis points over last year despite having the full benefit of the price increase in the quarter. Without the menu price impact, the food cost would have been around 200 basis points higher and this means underlying food inflation was around 8% over last year so our 6.3% price increase did not fully cover all of this inflation.  While expected food costs have stabilized in the second half of the year we saw costs for beef and avocados continue to rise in the quarter. Had ingredient cost primarily for beef and avocados stabilized as expected at the level we saw in Q2, our food costs would have been around 80 to 90 basis points lower and our restaurant level margins would have been approaching 30%. We expect these elevated food costs as a percentage of revenue to continue and even increase slightly in Q4 as continued inflation in beef and dairy is expected and will be offset by lower expected avocado costs.  As we look to 2015 we hope our costs will stabilize but we expect food cost inflation will be in the low single digits from where food costs were in Q3. Beef prices are expected to remain elevated through 2015 due to strong demand and the tight supply of livestock producers continue to rebuild their herds after two years of drought conditions. Avocado cost increased significantly this year due to light California crop though anticipate avocado cost will decline in Q4 as we source from Chile and Mexico. We don\u2019t expect much of any benefit from avocado prices next year due to rising demand and supply shortages caused by drought conditions in California and Chile.  We saw prices for cheese and sour cream increase to record highs in the quarter and we expect that dairy cost will remain high through the end of this year. But we do anticipate dairy price will come down in 2015 from these 2014 highs. Labor costs was 21.2% of sales in the quarter, decrease of 160 basis points from last year and year-to-date labor cost were down 100 basis points. Labor leverages driven by higher sales volumes partially offset by higher management, increased staffing ratios which contributed to slightly higher labor cost per store and by normal wage inflation. We expect labor cost as a percentage of sales to move higher in the fourth quarter due to seasonally lower sales.  While we have always offered a basic low cost health insurance plan to all of our hourly employees in the past, effective January 1, 2015 we will be offering coverage that qualifies under a portable caveat to eligible hourly employees. Currently we estimate over 10,000 of our hourly employees will have the opportunity to sign up for health insurance and while we can't predict how many will choose to enroll in this new plan we estimate that total cost will not exceed 1% of sales. We also will see minimal wage increases in a number of states and cities which we expect to have only a modest inflationary impact on labor because we pay above minimum wage.  Occupancy cost declined 70 basis points from last year for the quarter due to favorable sales leverage. Other operating costs were 10.2% in the quarter, decrease of 60 basis points versus last year and year-to-date they were 10.6% unchanged from last year. In the quarter other operating costs moved lower due to lower marketing and utility cost. Marketing was 1.3% in the quarter down 20 basis points from last year and is expected to increase to around 1.5% in the fourth quarter.  G&A 6.6% in the quarter, 20 basis points higher than last year and the increase was primarily driven by our Biannual Managers Conference held in September. The conference cost just over $10 million with nearly 3000 Chipotle employees and suppliers in attendance including all of our GMs and restaurateurs. In 2015 we will hold our Biannual Field Leadership Conference in the third quarter, which we expect will cost around $1 million. Non-cash stock comp was about $20 million in the quarter and year-to-date non-cash stock comp was about $83 million with a small portion of that in the labor line. We continue to expect non-cash stock comp for the full year will be around $98 million which is about $33 million higher than in 2013 due to this year options being issued at a much higher share price and as a result of much of the senior management team qualifying for retirement which accelerates the non-cash charges. As a perspective, G&A without the non-cash stock comp expense and without the cost on the All Manger Conference, G&A would have been down about 60 basis points compared to last year. G&A in the fourth quarter will be lower as a result of the reduce stock comp charge and not having the cost of the All Manger Conference which will be offset somewhat by a $1 million donation related to our annual burrito promotion and fund raising event benefitting Chipotle Cultivate Foundation along with normal G&A additions to support our growth. In 2015, we expect underlying G&A as a percentage of sales before non-cash stock comp charges will grow at a lesser rate than our sales growth. Effective tax rate for the third quarter was 37.2% which includes adjustments related to filing the 2013 tax return. We now expect our effective tax rate for 2014 to be around 38.5% and 2015 we expect the effective tax rate will be around 39.1%. The work opportunity tax credit and the R&D rate have not been renewed by Congress for 2014 or for 2015. If these credits are renewed, the state tax rate would benefit by about 50 basis points for each year. During the quarter we repurchased about $13 million of our stock or over 20,000 shares and the average annual share -- average share price was about $654. At the end of the third quarter we had about $127 million left on our share buyback program, previously approved by our Board. Overall we have invested $673 million to purchase nearly 4.2 million shares at an average price of $161 per share.  We finished the third quarter with over $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term interest bearing investment and no debt on our balance sheet. Although, we continue to believe the best use of our cash to invest in our high returning domestic restaurants, we plan to carefully nature groceries ShopHouse, Pizzeria Locale and Chipotle outside of the U.S. as we expect they will provide attractive value enhancing growth investments in the future. In the meantime we\u2019ll optimistically repurchase our stock to enhance shareholder value. Thanks for your time today and at this time we\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, please open the lines. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John Glass - Morgan Stanely : Thanks very much. First, Monty I just wanted to ask you about your thoughts on unit growth, are you beginning to hit a maximum number of stores you can open in a year given the real estate availability or own ability, human capital is this 200 plus or minus about where things level off, or how do you see it over the next I guess two to three years as you think about that? Montgomery F. Moran: Yeah John, thanks. Well, we don't really think in terms of maximums, in terms of maximizing our growth. What we do is, we continue to try to strike a balance and open restaurants when we -- at the speed with which we can find great real estate that we think will be performed well, plus the speed with which we can create or develop managers to really run those restaurants really effectively. So this month, we said, we will open 190 to 205 till next year. We talked to our real estate teams, that is where we struck the balance, that we believe we have got really strong people development throughout the country and certain markets being stronger than others. And our teams in the field feel very optimistic about this type of real estate they are finding and the prospects for those sites to do well. So, it's just a balancing act and we do think that this 190 to 205 is really a sensible growth rate. We are not talking yet about what we are going to do in 2016, 2017 but we suspect it will continue to strike that balance based on people and on how well our real estate performs. But if you look at our opening volume so far, like Jack said, our new stores opening about $1.7 million to $1.8 million on average and any other was trying not too far back where those were volumes that we hoped we would reach as a system. And now our brand new stores are opening at those volumes despite the fact that we are opening fewer tier one locations. So we are opening a lot more locations that in the past we might have walked by.  Also operations are the strongest they have ever been. Our throughput is the fastest it has ever been and there is a lot of reasons to believe that we can feel good about asking our field teams to pickup and run new restaurants and to be able to do it tremendously effectively. John Glass - Morgan Stanely : That's helpful and Jack just a clarification, the ACA cost you are talking about for 2015, you said not to exceed 1% of sales, what does that mean, is that an incremental 100 basis points of pressure versus 2014 or what do you mean by that 1%? John R. Hartung:  Yeah, it would be an incremental cost but we think it will not even reach 1%. We just don\u2019t know how to estimate it and so we just put kind of an upper range on it that we don\u2019t expect no matter how many. Even if more -- way more people than we think or that we estimate will elect for the new insurance that we are offering that it will still not be more than 1%. We think it is likely to be less than that. We just won't know until our people begin to enroll and that will happen here between now and the end of the year. John Glass - Morgan Stanely : Okay, thank you. Operator : And next question comes from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird. David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird: Hi, good afternoon and congratulations on great results. Jack, I wanted to ask a question about the comps momentum that you are having and could you talk specifically about potentially the trends exiting the quarter and entering Q4 and then maybe how would you frame up the outlook for Q4 given that the comparison does look maybe 300 basis points more difficult? John R. Hartung:  Yeah, David I would say that the trends through September and then into October so far have been very consistent. We are now comparing to a tougher quarter so last year we in the fourth quarter our comp was about 9.3% and it was like 6.1% or 6 point something percent in the third quarter. So a 300 basis point tougher comparison so I would expect for that you will see our comps decline by that tougher comparison. So from a dollar and transaction standpoint, the trends are holding well as we move from September to October. Yeah but the tougher comparison is going to have an impact for sure. David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird:  Great, very helpful and then maybe one on the cost side, the commodity environment seems to be getting worse and worse, so I was just wondering on what your thoughts were on if we can see continued pressure there, what your thoughts were on sort of another round of price increases, maybe not right away but as you move through 2015? John R. Hartung:  Yeah, David probably too early for us to consider a price increase. The way we think about the commodities right now, we are seeing pressure from three main areas from beef, from dairy, and from avocados. Avocados we think is more cyclical. It is caused by weather, it was caused by this year there was a shortage relative to the demand. While we think that is going to continue somewhat next year and so we won't get the break, and one time we thought we would get a break next year, we don\u2019t think we will get the break. We do expect that avocado cost will be relatively stable next year and we are hoping that this is going to be more of kind of upper limit for avocados but time will tell.  Beef is going to take a couple of years to grow out for to replenish the herd is going to take a couple of years. So we think that beef is probably going to remain at this elevated level, probably have additional pressure, hopefully not too severe a pressure going forward. Dairy we think will come back. We think that dairy has hit peaks and in fact just in last couple of weeks we have seen butter costs come down pretty dramatically, just in the last two weeks that effects the cost of our sour cream. And so if that holds we think that dairy is already starting to come back to where maybe a normal, kind of a normal sustained price could be.  So we knit it all together. It doesn\u2019t feel like extreme pressure David so it is too early for us to be even thinking about another price increase, so hopefully things will stay stable and we won't have to think about it until sometime after 2015. David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird:  Makes sense, thank you. John R. Hartung:  Thanks David. Operator : Our next question comes from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray :  Thank you and good afternoon. Great comps, I am wondering if you have some of your latest survey where it is talking about usage patterns, so if this more frequency from you mostly are gas or are there some new users in the next change of the course anything you can share on that front? Mark Crumpacker : Hi, Nicole, this is Mark Crumpacker, the Chief Marketing Officer. We don't right now have data that shows us which -- whether it's increased frequency from customers or new customers. It's our belief that it's a combination of both. We do have some feedbacks and research back on the advertising campaign we have done and we have seen increased awareness and increased purchase intent with all of our existing customers. So, that's leading us to believe that certainly a major factor, but given the level of the comps, we suspects there's got to be a large number of new customers in there as well. Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray : Okay. And you do want -- I don't know, if you do have your core guest, how many times they come and your most loyal, do you have anything on that as of late, how often they use you, on weekly basis, monthly or anything of that nature, probably? Mark Crumpacker : Well, that's actually not something that we track on a quarterly basis. We do that research regularly, we are doing it now, so we will have some feedback on that in the future but right now we don't. I can't tell you the increased frequency of the existing customers. Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray : Okay, great and then just back on the comp I think Jack last quarter you said, it was 2.5 price because there was only partial price, 2.5 mix and the rest was traffic, when you said 100 basis points of resistance I am not clear is that trade down in mix like the beef, the chicken conversation or is that meant to be a traffic resistant comment? John R. Hartung: Nicole, it looks like it's mostly traffic. We started to see some trade downs from steak to chicken like when we reported earnings in July, and we thought maybe that would increase but it really didn't. So the trade down effect, there is some from steak down to chicken was very modest. It didn't really continue to get worse and it levelled off quite a bit. So from what we can tell, it looks like maybe our comp but there is no resistance, should have been just a little over 20%, maybe 20.5% something like that. So we are looking at something less than 1% and it looks like it's driven on the transactions. Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray : Fantastic, thank you very much John R. Hartung: Thanks Nicole. Operator : And our next question comes from John Ivankoe, JP Morgan. Unidentified Analyst : Hi thanks, it is Gavin (ph) filling in. The first question is based on our estimates it appears you had a pretty extraordinary increase in year-over-year in unit volume and I know there were some concern back in 2012 when you might have been lapping over some very strong results in 2011. So, can you just help us maybe with, where you are opening units next year in terms of approving versus emerging new markets and how that compares to this year, if it is materially different in any way? John R. Hartung: Yeah, it's not going to be materially different. Next year we will -- I mean, this year we opened about 70% of our restaurants in proven markets, 15% in developing markets and 15% in new markets and next year will not be substantially different. It's a very similar strategy and just to carry over what we have done this year. Unidentified Analyst : Okay and then with the recent announcement of some restaurant partnerships with Apple Pay, can you just tell us maybe where you stand on mobile payment and whether the infrastructure is in place to roll that out now or you have to maybe make some additional technology investment behind POS or something else at the restaurant level? Steve Ells : Right now, we don't have imminent plants to roll out Apple Pay support. It's something that we are considering for 2015. There are considerable technological constraints implementing it, just based on the way payments are processed with our system. We are in the process of readying the launch of our new online app in November and when we do revel of that in the middle of next year, as our anticipated time, we might include Apple Pay. It's just a little bit too early for us to tell just given we haven't sorted out all of the backend issues. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And next will be Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital : Great, thank you very much. Just two questions, one on the comp side, as you now lap, as you look to 2015, it looks you are lapping what will be mid-teens comp growth in 2014. I mean wondering how you even think about what the right number should be, it looks like you guide low single digit to mid-single digit, just lapping such strong results, how do you even arrive at something like that, what kind of history do you use, how do you even comp with that on such a heroic lap that you have and then I had a follow up. Steve Ells : Well Jeff it's a great question and so we don't spend a lot of time trying to predict how we are going to over, to leap over that number. What we do is, we take our current sales trends and we literally just push them out over the next 14 months for the rest of this year and then for all of 2015. And if we don\u2019t increase our sales trends or if we don\u2019t decrease our sales trends we think we will be in this low to mid single digit comp range. This way we have always predicted the comps.  As you know we had 10 years of double digit comps before the recession that was interrupted during the recession, then we had almost two full years of double digit comps again after that. And so we really don\u2019t have a magic approach or a crystal ball to predict how you are going to exceed like a 19% comp for example. We are constantly working on improving our customer experience, we are constantly working on improving our people culture, we are constantly looking to upgrade the quality of our ingredients. Throughput, we are constantly working on throughput. So we are constantly working on the things that will enhance the dining experience and over the years it has paid off that when we do a good job, when we have great teams, when they do a good job of providing a great dining experience customers want to come back to Chipotle more often and hopefully it will happen again. And hopefully we will -- the comp guidance we have today will come back and say boy it looked conservative at the time. But there is no other way for us to predict it other than to take our current sales trend and then assume they don\u2019t change and then we back into a number which falls into that low to mid single digit range. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital : Understood and just a follow-up on the food inflation side, Jack I think in your remarks you said 2015 we should expect a low single digit basket increase but I know often times I think you said you were talking about relatively to 3Q, so I am just wondering you taking the 34.3% in the third quarter and we should assume low single digit off of that prior to pricing or may be if you could just tell us what the outlook is for 2015 either for the line item or what the overall basket is versus the full year 2014 or if there is any other way to look at it just to make sure we understand it correctly, the comparison you are making again? John R. Hartung:  What I would -- the way I would think about it Jeff is, we just finished a quarter with food cost in 34.3% range. Based on what we see today, we see hopefully relative stability with avocados. We won't get a break but hopefully it will be relatively stable. Dairy just hit a peak, just hit high, hopefully that will stabilize and maybe even come back. But beef there is going to be more pressure there and so when you net those three together and we assume everything else in what we buy is going to be relatively stable, we think there will slight pressure to next year from the 34.3%.  We don\u2019t know exactly what the pressure is going to be. We think it looks like it will be relatively modest barring unusual things like weather or supply shortages or things that we can't predict today. And so we think there is likely to be some modest pressure on the 34.3% that we are seeing in the third quarter today. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital : And that is even with the six plus percent pricing at least for the first part of next year but then assuming it is down for the rest of next year? John R. Hartung:  That is right. In my assumption about food cost pressure, I am assuming no price increase. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital : Got it, thank you. John R. Hartung:  Okay. Operator : And next will be Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Company:  Great, thank you. Another question on the 2015 comp guidance, I mean it seems like you are shifting off of the course or historically how you initially project the comps going into the next year. But the mathematics behind it that you just explained obviously, it seems like you are getting a lot of respect due to tougher comparison and just viably so, but it does seem like you build this time particularly this year be it throughput in a sustainable way and you really raised the base of the business and so when I think about 2015 can you talk through it a little bit more about what last could you on the throughput side of the world that has helped your comp so much this year and why maybe this time next year we could be surprised sitting here saying well that was a mid single digit comp projection was conservative? Montgomery F. Moran: Yeah, this is kind of two pieces to it, the throughput piece and then I will let Jack answer the balance of it. But when we look at throughput I mean, you can kind of look at two different directions. I mean, it is very hard to raise throughput without additional people wanting to eat at Chipotle. But we can, even if additional people don\u2019t want to -- we get the same amount of traffic. There still are opportunities to increase throughput just by moving our lines quickly especially at the peak lunch and peak dinner hours which we were able to do once again this quarter. But by the same token when you have a lot more people coming to us as has been the case recently, then throughput becomes even more important especially because of those peak lunch and peak dinner hour bottlenecks and our teams in the field are very focused on this and has been working really, really hard to drill the four pillars and to have everything going that are going to increase our throughput. And we have been measuring at the field entry level and all of our field leaders are aware of it and they know, where they stand versus their colleagues throughout the country in terms of their group of restaurants and their ability to deliver exclusively on the four pillars of throughput.  So, we have an opportunity we think to get much, much faster, because still our very fastest restaurants in the country at peak lunch hour are doing service 350 transactions an hour and sometimes even more than that on a very regular basis. So, we know it's possible to go very, very fast. Our average restaurant does something about one-third of that speed at peak lunch hours. So our ability to achieve higher throughput is enormous, but it depends on few things, obviously it depends on having plenty of customers coming through our doors, and it also depends on the type of customer and also depends whether its lunch or dinner. Because dinner people, there are going to be more children and more group orders which take longer to put through. And larger size transactions as well, which take longer to ring in.  So we have a huge amount of ability to increase throughput particularly if we keep seeing these increases in traffic. And so that increase in the throughput will help to drive the comp but also an increased comp can help to drive throughput. So it kind of goes both directions and now we feel really, really good about throughput because of having six more transactions coming through at lunch, six more transaction coming through at dinner than happened third quarter a year ago. Plus we put through an additional five transactions about, approximately five transactions for every single hour of business during the day. So there is not one time of the day, where we haven't managed to speed up and deliver better on the four pillars of throughput. So that gives us plenty of confidence that we can answer the call of any additional transaction that comes through the door. But that being said, I will let Jack answer the part about how we measure the comp. John R. Hartung: And I think your question about what else can happen, such that a year from now we look back and say boy that comp was conservative, is that the essence of the question? Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Company: I mean, I am just trying to think about how much respect you are giving the comparisons and really just build a bigger base, I guess more the question to Monty is like is there a percentage of the store base for instance, that doesn't have all four pillars, I am just trying to think about the run rate for comp growth from throughput even as you face tougher comparisons like this year? John R. Hartung: So, I think maybe the way to answer that, I think maybe the cause and effect and this is what I think the point Monty was making is, the cause and effect maybe different than what you are thinking. You are thinking that if we have great throughput that's what driving the comp, well we are getting our comp throughout every hour of the day and we need to be as fast as we possibly can during lunch and during dinner because we already have a heavy concentration of customer coming through at those times. We need to get faster because as more customers want to come to Chipotle if we don't get faster, we are going to be repelling them. We are not -- they are going to be walking off the back of our line, so the demand is happening and then throughput is necessary, absolute necessary to allow the demand that come in to our doors, go through the line and be satisfied customers. So, in terms of what's driving the comp, I think you have to back to Steve's comments that there is something going on in the industry. People are rejecting the traditional fast food model, they are, the Chipotle approach is resonating. I think what the marketing team have been doing is causing greater curiosity, especially with millenials where things like the Scarecrow and back to the start and Farmed and Dangerous, these are resonating with people that care about, where their food comes, how its raised, what's the impact on the environment, on their health, things like that. So there is a movement going on that is resonating. Chipotle is the only one that's doing what we are doing with food, with the people culture, where you feel like you are being treated to an authentic dining experience although it's affordable and it doesn\u2019t take that much time. And so, it's likely that these trends will continue. It's not likely that all the sudden people are going to stop worrying about where their food comes from. And stop appreciating the wonderful experience that they get by joining Chipotle. So it's likely that, that will continue. It is incumbent upon us and teams then to make sure throughput is there ready for the customers as they come in, so that we can expect them into our line. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Company: Okay that makes sense and as far as the GMO free menu goes, are we any closer to an announcement date on that? Steve Ells : Well, we don't have a specific announcement date, but we can tell you that, we are largely serving only ingredients that are free of GMOs. And so we have made a ton of progress on that, we recently rolled out all of our tortillas being GMO free and there is just no announcement date yet. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Company: Okay, thank you. Operator : And next will be Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo. Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo : Thanks, Jack can you share with us where chicken, beef, dairy, avocado, and whatever else matters where they stand as a percent of COGS and how should we think about the relationship between spot prices and what you are paying for lot of those higher quality inputs? John R. Hartung:  Yes Jeff, we don\u2019t talk about the individual ingredients and the percentage because that changes overtime like steak this year would be higher than last year but if you take beef, chicken, avocados, cheese, and beans those are our top five ingredients and those account for right around half of everything that we buy. Okay, so any one of those when you have a significant impact on COGS here up or down it is going to have a meaningful impact on our cost of goods sales. Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo : And then in terms of looking at spot as a proxy for any of those, is that still a directional sort of proxy? John R. Hartung:  It is directional, you just have to be careful of the source. Like for example if the source is the same beef that we would be using there is going to be an impact. Right now the pressure that is affecting beef is that there were these droughts and the drought affected all these naturally raised and commodity beef as well. So that is something that when you look at the source of why there is a shortage, something like weather is likely to affect both naturally raised as well as commodity. Years ago there were world factors that were affecting chicken, that were affecting like bird flu and things like that, they didn\u2019t affect us at all. So, Jeff you got to look to the source. Generally, when it is drought conditions, when it is general supply and demand, generally those things are at least directionally kind of impact commodity and actually raise ingredients as well and may not be on the exact same timing, may not be the exact same magnitude but everything I am telling you about dairy, about beef as well as with avocados you are seeing similar trends in the commodity markets as well. Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo :  Okay, and then you touched on it but as your brand awareness and unit volumes continue to grow, what's been the resulting impact on restaurants and the comparable store base. So are they entering sort of neutral tail end headwind and where does it sort of stand relative to where you were few years ago? John R. Hartung:  No, the new stores still out comp existing stores. The five year old existing stores still comp like in the double digits while in the double digits. So, when we do, when we see these kind of comps it is very broad based in terms of the layer of store openings, it is broad based in terms of markets. And when our new stores, even though our new restaurants are opening out way higher volumes than they ever had before, they still out comp the stores that are two years old or three years old, really every other stores. So, they come in stronger and then they comp stronger than every other layer as well. Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo :  Thank you. John R. Hartung:  Thanks Jeff. Operator : And moving on to Bryan Elliott with Raymond James. Bryan Elliott - Raymond James :  Good afternoon gentlemen. First couple of things, one maybe a little nit to pick, couldn\u2019t you have done something to push the comp over 20% for the quarter? Steve Ells : It is too organized. John R. Hartung: We will work on that for the next quarter. Bryan Elliott - Raymond James : No, seriously my question, I guess the clarification of that question, Jack just clarifying again this 1% traffic pressure or response to pricing that you mentioned. So, you are as I heard you, you said you were kind of looking at the traffic growth rate prior to the price increase and then subsequent to the price increase there was a 1% decline or point decline in the rate of traffic growth, is that what you were saying? John R. Hartung:  That's right Bryan. Bryan Elliott - Raymond James : Okay. John R. Hartung:  Now just with that in mind when you have 1% or something less than 1% there is a lot of noise in there too until we are going to continue to watch that. Bryan Elliott - Raymond James : Sure, I just wanted to make sure I understood what exactly the message was. My question, I would like to if I could drill down a little more into ACA commentary and understand I guess you have sorted some of the details. You talked about after an ACA compliance plan to all the eligible hourly, there may be 10,000 of them and can you help us with what exactly ACA compliance means with respect to the income. And so I think to the ACA compliance if I recall correctly and it has kind of dropped out of the news and all but the portion of the premium that you can ask the employee to cover has to be I believe at something like 9% or less of their total income and so A) is that right and B) I guess in thinking about that there is going to be -- it is going to be impossible to know until after the fact how many people at certain pay grades are going to be buying into the insurance and how much your portion is going to be versus their portion, I mean if you could flush out a little of that\u2026? John R. Hartung:  Bryan what you are talking about is to comply, you need to have a plan that's credible. Okay, so it meets the requirements, so it has got to be real insurance and there are guidelines for that, and our plan does meet that, and it has got to be affordable. And affordable, you are roughly right that it has got to be, what's tough about it, it has got to be based on household income. So we don\u2019t know whether there is other income earners in the family so we had to use some estimates. We feel pretty good though about the fact that everyone will be able to afford this plan. We have gone through a lot of different assumptions, a lot of different calculations. We know what our folks are making, what we don\u2019t know is how much are there other wage earners in the house are making. So we think that our plan is going to be affordable by most if not all the employees that are going to be offered insurance. It is more than 10,000 people Bryan, we don\u2019t have an exact number but I said a number more than 10. So it is for sure more than that, that are going to be eligible. And eligible means that you have worked here for a year and during this time you have averaged 30 hours or more. And what we are going to be doing throughout the year is each month as people hit their anniversary date, we are going to identify whether they qualify. So it is an estimate because each month we are going to be roughly calculating and kind of having reenrollment throughout the year to see if people, to see if our employees are eligible and if they choose to go ahead and enter the insurance roles. Bryan Elliott - Raymond James : And are we talking just about hourly because I assume that the management staff is already on a corporate type insurance program? John R. Hartung:  Salary of management and we have typically at least two salaried managers, a GM and Restaurateur and then an apprentice in each restaurant. They already qualify for health insurance today. So you are talking about our hourly crew and our hourly managers in a restaurant that will not qualify. Bryan Elliott - Raymond James : And of the total premium cost roughly what is the split between the employee and the employer? John R. Hartung:  We are paying the majority of it and we have to, to make it affordable. Bryan Elliott - Raymond James : Sure, I am just wondering is it like something that you are going to pay 75% or 80% of it or is it more like a little north of 50%? John R. Hartung:  No, it depends on whether it is family or not but it is for example, it will cost an average employee a couple of hundred bucks or so a month. And in terms of the premium that doesn\u2019t count deductibles and things like that. You know in the company on average we think it is going to cost us around $3000 a year. So we are paying more than half of it for sure. And we are doing everything we can to make it affordable, as affordable as possible. I have also read about some very, very high deductible. You know these high deductible plans are reasonable deductions. You know deductible plans kind of which is considered to be normal. I was reading the other day about deductible plans that have like a $5000 and $6000 deductible. So, it is what you consider to be a normal deductible, kind of a normal monthly premium, couple of hundred bucks principally and then Chipotle is paying over what we estimate to be over $3000 per employee per year. Bryan Elliott - Raymond James : Very helpful, thank you. John R. Hartung:  Thanks Bryan. Operator : And next will be Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. You mentioned catering contributing to the check, can you just give us an update on what percent of sales is catering and how big a portion are you making this holiday season on that business? John R. Hartung:  Joe, the catering we have mentioned, our catering was like 1.6% in the second quarter but seasonally with graduations we saw that as being seasonally our highest quarter. This quarter we are right around 1% catering so we did pull back a bit and I don\u2019t know if we do have anything special plan Monty. Montgomery F. Moran: We will be doing holiday promotions for it. It starts out as we put one of the things we have learned about Chipotle Catering is it actually is slightly more appealing to folks that are doing parties at home than it is to people that are doing things in the office. So we tend to put our marketing around events that happened at home like graduations, Super Bowl that sort of thing. I am sorry, just like we call it the big game. But keep in mind with catering too, right now we are just rolling out catering and we don\u2019t have online ordering for it. It is really just in its infancy so it has a -- there is a long way to go as we roll this out. Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Okay, thank you. And Monty just quickly because you mentioned online ordering, is that becoming a more significant part of your store business, I mean away from catering? John R. Hartung:  Joe if you take all of the online, like the iPhone, fax, online ordering and catering together it is somewhere around 5.5% to 6%. It was like 6% last quarter so it is caught between 5.5% and 6%. So it figure, I mean three to four years ago, five years ago it was 3.5% to 4%, so it has definitely moved up. But we know that there are companies out there that are doing 7%, 8% 9%, 10% of their sales. So we think there is still lot of room to move. Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Okay, thank you. John R. Hartung:  Thanks Joe. Operator : And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. Steve Ells : Thank you all for joining us this afternoon and we will look forward to speaking again next quarter. Operator *: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation today.",

All participants are now in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like introduce Chipotle\u2019s Director of Investor Relations, Mark Alexee. You may begin your conference. Mark Alexee : Good afternoon everyone and welcome to our call today. By now you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the fourth quarter and year end 2014. It may also be found on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include projections of a number of restaurants we intend to open, new restaurants that [indiscernible] and new restaurant volumes. Statements about potential shareholders or projections of comparable restaurant sales increases or comps, trends in food, labor and G&A costs, our expected effective tax rates, statements about stock repurchases as well as other statements of our expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today and we are not assuming any obligation to update them. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated on our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks. Our discussion today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation of which will be found on the presentation page of the Investor Relations section of our Web site. I would like to remind everyone that we have adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period begins on the first day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues over the next earnings conference call. For the first quarter, it will begin March 1st and will continue through our Q1 earnings release on April 21, 2015. On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Monty Moran, Co-Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Crumpacker, Chief Marketing and Development Officer. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve. Steve Ells : Thanks Mark. I am extremely pleased with our performance during the fourth quarter and throughout 2014. During the quarter we generated revenue of $1.1 billion, an increase of 26.7% on comparable restaurant sales growth of 16.1% and the opening of 16 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings per share of $3.84, an increase of 51.8%. For the full year we generated revenue of $4.1 billion on comparable restaurant sales growth of 16.8% and the opening of 192 new restaurants. While those results would be strong for a Company of any size I think they\u2019re particularly impressive considering how we now have nearly 1,800 restaurants averaging nearly $2.5 million each. Quite simply, I do not think that we would be able to deliver these results without such a compelling and broader vision we have made it our mission to change the way people think about any fast food and we have created an extraordinary food and people culture, and a very strong unit economic model that is allowing us to do that. Recently we\u2019ve seen strong evidence that our commitment to sourcing sustainably raised ingredients is resonating with many consumers. In January we decided to spend one of our pork suppliers after a routine audit reveal that they were not following all of our animal welfare protocols. Choosing to suspend the supplier meant that we would not be able to supply carnitas to about one third of our restaurants. While we could have chosen to replace this supply with pork from conventionally raised pigs, we decided not to because most conventionally raised pigs are subjected to conditions that we find unacceptable. Conventionally raised pigs are typically raised indoors with no outdoor or access to [indiscernible] and are typically given antibiotics non-therapeutically to simulate growth and to prevent illness from spreading due to harsh crowded living conditions. These conventional practices are unacceptable to us and we refuse to serve pork from animals raised in that manner. Since we made this decision the majority of sentiment from our customers has been very supportive in the email and web comments along with social media posts, customers are applauding our commitment to our vision, thanking us for standing on principal, commending us for taking action against the inhumane treatment of animals and congratulating us for standing by our business values. We certainly appreciate what we are hearing from our customers and are great full for their continued loyalty. We\u2019re also pleased to see this response that shows that our vision and our commitment to sourcing responsibly raise ingredients including respecting animal welfare are resonating with people in a very real and powerful way. People care about where their food comes from and how it is raised. And we are proud of the tremendous progress we have made over the years. Last year we served more than 165 million pounds of responsibly raised meat more than a 20% increase from 2013. All of our responsibly raised meat comes from animals that are raised in more humane ways and without the use antibiotics or added hormones. Meat from animal raised to these higher welfare standards still accounts for a small percentage of the total meat production in this country. Yet we continue find ways to increase our supply year-after-year. Because meat raised in this way is such a small portion of the overall supply system we will see disruptions from time-to-time. But these disruptions just reinforced and strengthen our commitment to continue to look for ways to increase the supply that is available to us whether from existing suppliers who can grow with us, exploring additional cuts to add to our supply well, enhancing the quality of flavor or finding new suppliers that meet our high standards. Our commitment to sourcing food that is raised responsibly is not limited to pork, chicken and beef. During the year we continued our use of [indiscernible] an organically grown beans and we eclipsed our 2014 goal of serving 20 million pounds of locally grown. In a food system that is so heavily dominated by relatively few large producers its extraordinary progress and our teams has encountered and overcome numerous hurdles to reach each of these milestones. I\u2019m certain that we will continue to face challenges in this area, that our commitment rate remains the strong as ever and we will find ways to keep making progress simply because we believe that serving food from these great ingredients is the right thing to do. While the customer response to how we handle our pork situation is encouraging it\u2019s not the only sign that more and more people are becoming more curious and more discerning about where their food comes from. For example our vision is really resonating with teens, millennials and generation x. According to industry research Chipotle is one of the most popular restaurant chains among teens and has been growing in popularity among this demographic. This report from 2014 ranks Chipotle as the third most popular brand among teens up from number eight 2013. Gen x consumers were 33% more likely than average to use Chipotle, with millennials Chipotle was even more popular with customers in this group 75% more likely been average to choose Chipotle over other restaurants. We believe that our popularity among these younger consumers is tied to our vision and the growing interest in issues related to food and how it is raised. Our own research shows that these issues are clearly becoming more relevant and important when customers choose where they will dine. Based on our ongoing tracking research 87% of fast casual diners say they prefer to eat foods that are grown locally up from 70% in 2011. 86% ingredients raised or grown in a more responsible way taste better, that\u2019s up from 76% in 2011. 73% feels it's important to buy organic for certain food items up from 61% in 2011. And 69% try to eat meat that has been raised responsibly and that\u2019s up 53% in 2011. From the very first Chipotle restaurant nearly 22 years ago we have chartered our own path for how a restaurant company should be run in every single way. We have shown that you can own and operate all of your restaurants rather than franchise and still grow at a rapid rate, that you can spend more on ingredients not less, still serve high quality food at reasonable prices and have industry leading margins and returns, that you can build teams of top performers and power them to deliver high standards while still maintaining an efficient labor model and that you can remain focused on doing just a few things extremely well rather than trying to be all things to all people or engaging in a kind of marketing gimmicks that it become the hallmarks of traditional fast food and still continue to attract new customers and profitably grow the business over the long-term.  We believe this is the new fast foot model. But this model is not limited to just burritos and tacos and as you know we are in the early stages of developing two new concepts ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen and Pizzeria Locale that embrace the principals that have made Chipotle successful over the years. We believe operating these cuisines following the Chipotle model is a great way to offer variety to our customers elevating the dining experience for pizza and Asian Cuisine just as we have done with Chipotle and we believe this is a much better way to create additional compelling shareholder value as compared to the traditional restaurant model of flooding the menu with so many items that is impossible to serve anything that is extraordinary. During the quarter we opened the newest shop house in Washington DC's Union Station, the ninth ShopHouse so far. And in January we finalized the deal to open the first Pizzeria Locale outside of Denver this one in Kansas City\u2019s Waldo neighborhood. While we are pursuing additional sites for each of these concepts I will remind you that most of our growth for the foreseeable future will continue to be driven by opening Chipotle Restaurants in the United States. Chipotle has created the new fast food model and it\u2019s the underlying principles of that model that continue to drive our financial success. Increasingly our vision of changing the way people think about any fast food is resonating with consumers many of whom want a better, more responsible alternative to traditional fast food. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Monty. Monty Moran : Thanks Steve. Our ongoing ability to deliver impressive financial results arises from a special culture that we\u2019ve built at Chipotle that has led to the development of strong leaders. These leaders are able to attract very talented people to our company and to develop those people to be at their best. Because of this we\u2019re able do things most of our competitors can\u2019t do. For instance other restaurants rely heavily on automated systems to reduce the amount of training and skill that is necessary to do their work in an effort to simplify training and make operations full proof. On the other hand at Chipotle we hire energetic and ambitious people who have a desire to learn classic cooking skills, how to be a successful leader in the business acumen necessary to run a highly successful business. But we ask even more of our people we ask them to elevate the people around them and we judge all of our leaders based on how positively they do that. By rewarding this behavior we elevate the dining experience our customers enjoy each time they visit which leads to excellent operations. One of the rewards of this kind of enlightened leadership is the rapid promotion of our talented leaders into positions within the restaurants where they can have a greater effect on more of our crew people. Over 90% of our general managers come from crew positions so people are really starting to understand the kind of opportunity that awaits them at Chipotle. The extraordinary culture that we have created with the restaurateur program as a cornerstone is one of the areas where we are unique within the restaurant industry. That\u2019s one of the key drivers of our business and this culture is growing stronger. We\u2019ve made important investments over the past year or so to further strengthen this culture and our ability to develop restaurant tourists at a faster rate and across more restaurants.  First we have reduced the field leadership ratios from a high of around 15 restaurants for a field leader just a few years ago to about eight restaurants per field leader today.  Secondly, we created the restaurateur diagnostic and plan tool which helps our field leaders properly diagnose inadequacies and weaknesses in the culture of each restaurant they supervise. Also this tool generates a clear and actionable plan which helps the GM address the underlying causes that are preventing that restaurant team from becoming a restaurateur. The combination of these two investments is just now beginning to pay off. While we promoted a similar number of restaurateurs during the past two year we\u2019re currently approaching the largest backlog of GMs ready to be interviewed to become restaurateurs that we\u2019ve ever had at one time. This gives me great confidence that 2015 will be a breakout year for us in terms of restaurateur development which means that even more of our restaurants will be better than they are today, with better throughput, better food and a better overall customer experience. I am confident about this because our restaurateur shows us time and time again that the special cultures they create lead to better restaurants in every way. Better field leadership ratios alone might not accelerate restaurateur development but with the development and plan tool in place and better ratios that allow our field leaders to dive deep into and better understand each restaurant\u2019s culture we feel that we\u2019re in a position to accelerate the proliferation of this powerful culture quickly into more restaurants. So I am excited to see the dividends from this combined investment payoff this year and in the coming years. One of the benefits of having great teams and great cultures is the ability to deliver superior throughput. When done well throughput isn\u2019t simply about moving people to the restaurant as quickly as possible instead it\u2019s about outstanding customer service with clear, authentic communication with customers as they efficiently move down our serving line. During the quarter we continued to make progress in terms of throughput on top of the outstanding throughput we drove in the fourth quarter of 2013. We increased our average peak lunch hour transactions by three and out of that average of five more transactions during the peak dinner hour. We attributed this to our continued emphasis on the four pillars and the effectiveness of our auditing of and reporting to our field teams who get frequency back on how well they\u2019re executing these four pillars. Since beginning of the four pillars reporting effort we\u2019ve seen significant improvement and we recently expanded our reporting to include peak dinner hours in addition to peak lunch hours. With this standard reporting we continue to better execute the four pillars of both and dinner which we expect will pay-off as we head into our busiest season in just a few months. Finally I\u2019d like to provide an update on development. During the quarter we opened 60 new restaurants bringing our total to 192 restaurants opened during the year coming in at the higher end of our guided range of 180 to 195. Nearly 80% of these new restaurants opened and proven for established markets while the remainder opened and developing are new markets. This makes allowed us to expand our footprint in markets where we have strong presence and strong teams while also introducing our unique dining experience to customers in new markets. For 2015 we expect to open 190 to 205 new restaurants with a similar distribution between proven, established, developing and new markets. And a small number of [indiscernible] restaurants as well. Overall we\u2019re seeing more competition per site given the relative health of the economy but Chipotle remains a very desirable tenant and so we continue to have success in obtaining great real estate locations. In 2014 our total average development cost including international, ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale locations was about $849,000 net of land reimbursements. The increase in our development cost this year was driven by opening more free standing restaurants along with higher cost locations in the northeast. And improving commercial real estate and construction market has also contributed to an increase in development cost. In 2015 we expect our average restaurant development cost to decrease based on opening more traditional in-cap and in-line restaurants which are generally easier to build and cost less in the free standing restaurants.  I\u2019m more confident now that we have the right pieces in place, a strong food culture, a strong and empowering people culture and an industry leading unit economic model to continue on our path to change the way people think about and eat fast food. I know that our success in doing that will allow us to generate outstanding returns for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to John. John Hartung : Thanks, Monty. We\u2019re proud of results we achieved during the fourth quarter and for the entire year of 2014 as our empowered restaurant teams continue to delight our customers with great service, while preparing and serving a delicious meal made from responsibly raised ingredients to each and every customer.  In the fourth quarter we compared against 2013's highest quarterly comp at 9.3% and we\u2019re delighted to be able to serve many more customers and delivery fourth quarter comp of 16.1% on top of that 9.3% comp in 2013. This 16.1% comp help to drive our total quarterly revenue to $1.1 billion, an increase of 26.7% and our full year revenue totaled $4.1 billion and increase of 27.8% on a full year comp of 16.8%. These increased sales are driven primarily by increase customer visits along with an average check increase of 8.3%, increase in average check was primarily driven by the menu price increase we took mid-year of 6.3% and to a lesser extent by continued growth in catering and in group size.  We\u2019re maintaining our full year 2015 same-store sales guidance in the low to mid-single digit range, while we\u2019re bullish about the sales trends and the growing consumer awareness and appreciation for our sustainably raised ingredients, in 2015 we will compare against the toughest comps we\u2019ve ever had as a public company. We expect our comps will be the highest in the first quarter and then become more difficult as we begin to [indiscernible] the menu increase starting in the second quarter and then begin to flatten out as we compared to the 19.8% comp in Q3 and the 16.1% in the fourth quarter. As a result of this strong comp our average sales volume for restaurant that have been opened for at least 12 months is now $2,472,000 the highest we\u2019ve ever achieved. This average volume along with our industry leading restaurant level margins help us deliver among the highest restaurant level returns in the industry and nearly double the very attractive returns we earned when we first became a public company. Our new restaurants also continue to perform exceptionally opening above our communicated sales range of $1.7 million to $1.8 million and in fact we now expect our new restaurants to open in the range of 1.8 million to 1.9 million and grow from this initial opening level. We opened 16 new restaurants in the quarter bringing our year-to-date openings to 192 which is at the high-end of our guidance range for 2014 and we ended the year with 1,783,000 restaurants including 17 Chipotle restaurants outside the U.S., nine ShopHouse and two Pizzeria Locales. As Monty mentioned earlier we plan to open between 190 to 205 new restaurants in 2015 which we expect will be reasonably level loaded throughout the year.  Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $3.84, an increase of 51.8%, restaurant level margins increased in the quarter by 100 basis points to 26.6%. Margins were impacted by strong transaction trends and the menu price increase from the middle of last year. Diluted EPS was $14.13 for the full year 2014 an increase of 35% over 2013. EPS growth outpaced our sales growth as the higher comps in food and menu increase allowed us to leverage labor and occupancy lines at the restaurant level. Margins for the year increased 60 basis points to 27.2% in 2014. The full year margin impact included underlying food inflation of about 7.5% and because we increased prices around mid-year our effective price increase for the full year was only about 3.8% which did not fully cover all of this food inflation. Food cost were 35% in the quarter up 110 basis points from 2013 and sequentially higher by 70 basis points from the third quarter. While avocado cost decline in the quarter as we shifted away from buying California avocados that benefit was more than offset by higher beef, and dairy cost during the quarter. Beef prices are expected to remain elevated throughout the year and into 2016 due to continued supply constraints and avocado prices are expected to be slightly higher in 2015 as increased demand is projected to exceed the higher yields we expect from California and Mexico during the year.  We expect dairy price to come down during Q1 from record highs for our cheese and sour cream from late 2014 and remain at normalized levels throughout the remainder of 2015. We also expect about a $2 million charge in the first quarter on our food line related to the suspension of one of our pork suppliers. As Steve mentioned decision to stop serving this pork was driven by commitment to principals underlying food with integrity including animal welfare protocols and the response from our loyal customers has been very supportive. So all things considered we expect our food cost in 2015 to remain at about the 35% level we saw in the fourth quarter as the continued pressure in the prices of beef and avocado will be roughly offset by lower prices for dairy with full year food cost remain in that 35% range. We don\u2019t have any plans for an across the board menu price increase in 2015 since we just increased prices and because we\u2019re currently earning at or near record margins and returns. In addition it's important to us that we remain accessible or affordable to our customers as this is the core to our ability to change the way people think about any fast food. But had we known earlier last year that beef prices would continue to rise we may have increased the prices for our Steak and Barbacoa more than we did. We did increase the price of these two items much higher than any other entr\u00e9e in an effort to charge the fair going price for our Steak and Barbacoa. And we expected to see some trade off from Steak and Barbacoa as a result of the higher relative price. But we saw virtually no trade down. The continued rise in beef prices has resulted in the up charge for these entr\u00e9es not covering the higher ingredient cost. So we\u2019re open to considering a targeted price increase later in 2015 on our Steak and perhaps Barbacoa to help cover the rising cost of beef. Because Steak and Barbacoa account for less than one third of the entr\u00e9es we sell we expect any increase we might consider to have a relatively modest impact on our overall results. But our Food With Integrity mission depends on our ability to charge a fair price for the ingredients we serve and we\u2019re not quite doing that with our beef right now, so while we\u2019re open at a possibility we\u2019ve not made a decision to raise beef prices at this time and we\u2019ll keep you updated if and when we decide to so. Labor costs were 22.2% of sales in the quarter a decrease of 80 basis points from 2013. And for the full year labor cost were down 100 basis points from 2013. These decreases were mainly due to leverage from the higher full year comp including the menu price increase partially offset by increased wage inflation and hire manager and crew staffing. While Chipotle has always offered a simple streamline health insurance option to all of our hourly employees on January 1, 2015 we began to offer medical coverage that qualifies under the Affordable Care Act to full time hourly employees, that is those employees working 30 or more hours per week and with at least 12 months of service. Over 10,000 hourly employees were eligible for this plan based on service length and actual hours work and more than 1,000 employees have enrolled so far. The enrollment number is likely to increase going forward as additional employees will qualify each month as they hit the full time status and as they hit their one year anniversary. And based on the over 1,000 enrolled so far our estimate of expected number and the estimate of expected additional enrollees going forward we expect the additional cost of this health insurance in 2015 to be in the $4 million to $8 million range and all of that will hit our labor line. Other operating costs were 10.5% for the quarter which is down 80 basis points from 2013 due to leverage from the higher comp in the quarter and slightly lower marketing cost. For the full year other operating costs were 10.6% or down 20 basis points from 2013. Marketing was 1% of sales for the quarter compared to 1.2% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our marketing expenses dropped sequentially by 30 basis points as our skillfully made advertising campaign ended for most markets in October. For the full year marketing was 1.4% of sales in 2014 in line with 2013 and we expect it to increase slightly to around 1.5% to 1.6% in 2015. G&A was 5.7% at quarter or 90 basis points lower than 2013 due primarily to the timing of the accrual for our annual bonus program and the increased acceleration of stock compensation expense in the first three quarters of the year as another one of our officers achieved retiree status.  For the full year G&A was 6.7% or 40 basis points higher than 2013 primarily driven by higher non-cash non-economic stock comp and from our biennial All Managers\u2019 conference held in September where nearly 3,000 Chipotle employee and suppliers were in attendance. The non-cash non-economic stock comp expense was $15 million in the quarter and $98 million for the full year which is about $33 million higher than in 2013 due to options granted in 2014 being issued at a much higher share price and as a result of more of the senior management team qualifying for retirement which accelerates the non-cash charges. These items accounted for about 50 basis points of the increase in G&A so without these items underlying G&A would have been lower for the full year 2014. In 2015, we will hold a biennial Field Leadership conference in the third quarter and we expect that will cost around $2 million. The compensation committee of our Board is actively evaluating our executive comp for 2015 and until that is finalized and approved we\u2019re unable to project and communicate the stock comp expense expected for 2015. Our comp committee expects to finalize the plan in the next week or so and we\u2019ll communicate the impact when we\u2019re able to. Our 2014 effective tax rate was 37.6% and this is lower than the rate projected at Q3 because of adjustment and our state tax rate due to a change in estimate of usable employer credits and the renewal of the work opportunity and R&D credits in the fourth quarter. Unfortunately the renewal was only approved for 2014 so without the state tax adjustment and without the work opportunity in R&D credit we expect our 2015 tax rate to return to about 39%. These federal credits are renewed the effective tax rate would benefit by about 40 basis points in 2015. During the quarter we purchased about $25 million worth of our stock for over 37,500 shares at an average share price of $650. For the year we purchased about $88 million worth of stock and over 153,000 shares at an average share price of $572. At the end of 2014, we still had about $102 million remaining and a previously announced share buyback program and we're announcing today that the board is authorizing additional share repurchase program of another $100 million. Overall since 2008 we've invested more than $700 million to purchase more than 4.2 million shares at an average price of $166 per share. Capital expenditures net of landlord reimbursements totaled about $240 million in 2014 primarily related to new restaurants along with continued reinvestment existing restaurant and other company initiatives including a significant upgrade of our restaurant network infrastructure. For 2015 we anticipate CapEx will be around 220 million, the majority of which relates to new restaurant construction. In 2014 we increased our total cash and investments by $362 million to $1.250 billion even after funding the opening of 192 restaurants and repurchasing $88 million of stock through our share buyback agreements and we still have no debt on our balance sheet. We continue to believe that investing in a high returning new restaurants remains the best use of our cash and we're confident that the growth options we're developing today including ShopHouse, Chipotle and International markets and Pizzeria Locale will provide value enhancing growth opportunities in the future and in the meantime we'll continue to invest in our high returning domestic restaurants and we'll optimistically repurchase our stock to enhance shareholder value. Thanks for your time today and at this time we'd be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, please open the lines. Operator : Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. John Glass : Thanks. First John, could you just clarify your comment around food cost particularly that you're not going to take pricing but you might take some pricing and that pricing is against targeted, when would you make that decision if not now, because it sounds like beef is going to stay elevated and maybe you can just frame if you did cover that cost increase what the implications for overall cost inflation might be in that scenario? Unidentified Company Representative : Yes John, I know that I can be that precise because we haven't made a decision but when we raised our prices in the middle of last year, we double the increase or the difference between our chicken burrito for example and our steak and Barbacoa burrito, historically we've had about $0.30 or $0.35 up-charge for that and we doubled that to about $0.70 and that at the time came closer or is in the ballpark of covering our additional ingredient cost for serving a steak burrito for example. We'll now get cost as an extra dollar or so to serve steak versus chicken and so, we're actually not covering that up-charge and so it's that situation that causes us to think that we're subsidizing steak and Barbacoa with other items on the menu and that doesn't make sense to us so recognizing that kind of shortfall, we're at least considering raising prices on right now our steak and our Barbacoa. We don't expect to do anything before midyear John, we don't want to have a second increase even though it would be just on a few menu items. We'd rather not do that within a 12 month period, we don't want to double up on price increases. We think in order for us to remain accessible, we want to hold off as long as we can so we'll look and see watch what happens to these prices throughout the next quarter or two and then around the middle of the year we'll decide whether it makes sense to go ahead and do some kind of a targeted price increase as I just described. In terms of the impact John, we did a $0.30 or $0.40 impact or increase that would be a roughly a 5% or so increase as the order of magnitude steak and Barbacoa and say they account for less than a third of our menu, that would be somewhere between maybe 100 to 150 basis point menu price increase across all of our menu. So, it's not a huge impact to our overall menu, not a huge impact to our margins but just kind of gets our individual margins for the entr\u00e9es that we serve a little bit more in line. John Glass : And just a follow up on the food question, you remove pork from about a third of your restaurants and you said the customers received it well, does that have an impact therefore on sales or no impact on sales and is that also in any way feeding into your view on food cost for '15. Unidentified Company Representative : John, at this point it seems to have mostly just -- people are just trading off for chicken or beef or in a few cases our other offerings and it doesn't seem to hit sales at all but certainly yet we'll have more time to analyze that. John Glass : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird. David Tarantino : Hi, good afternoon and congratulations on a great 2014. Jack, I was wondering if you could comment on how that comp trended throughout the quarter and while there are very strong in an absolute basis they did slow a little bit from Q3 on a one and two year basis so, just wondering what your thoughts are on that sort of modest slowdown that you saw there and then secondly if you could comment on what you're seeing so far in the first quarter that would be helpful. Thanks. Jack Hartung : Okay, David, during the quarter sales were lower, accounts were lower in November than they were in the other two months and as we can look back at the quarter and as we look back, our sales trends during November, whether was cold through much of number and I think a lot of restaurant companies all saw the same thing and so we think there might have been a temporary weather impact during November. Now we typically don\u2019t ever say that our comp was negatively affected by the weather because usually when the weather improves or returns to more normal weather our customers come back and it kind of makes up for it. So I don\u2019t know that there was a net impact of weather during the quarter but we did see that our comps did dip November and then rebounded back in December. And then into January so far we\u2019re seeing similar sales and transaction trends not necessarily the same comp, in fact not the same comp because as moved in the first quarter we\u2019re now comparing against 13.3 or 13.4. So obviously that comparison is a tougher comparison but in terms of just absolute transaction at dollar levels in January we\u2019re seeing similar trends to what we saw in the fourth quarter. Operator : (We'll go to) [ph] John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : Hi, great, thank you. Also a question on pricing and how you think about COGS. 35% in the history of Chipotle is the high number so I just wanted to get a sense of why you don\u2019t consider taking at price increase across the menu as opposed to just isolating that as B to I guess acknowledge the A, you could do in a six or nine months ago and didn\u2019t affect customer traffic at all and secondly just to expect what might be a new economic reality that pricing in general is going up across the economy weather because of commodities, because of labor what have you, and if you can just touch on the point that Steve made in his prepared remarks I think there was a comment about the number of Chipotle imitators that were coming into the market place. You\u2019re seeing any kind of competitive impact what so ever on a local basis I mean we certainly can\u2019t see it on a national basis in your comps that are giving you at least somewhat of a hesitation of the amount of pricing that the concept can handle. Unidentified Company Representative : John, I\u2019ll take the menu price concept first. First of all in terms of raising menu prices, we just don\u2019t put a very high importance on our food cost percent as a percent of sales what we\u2019ve always focused more on is what is our overall margin and when we apply that margin to our sales what is our unit economic return which at these sales and these margins and with the investment that we\u2019ve got we\u2019re talking about a 70% or so return on investment which is roughly double what other successful chains are delivering. And so we don\u2019t feel this urge with these margins and these returns to increase price just because our food cost happen to be higher.  [indiscernible] our food cost were going to be 40% but we generated 80% return. So our margins will be higher and our returns will be higher, will that be something that investors would expect, I think the answer would be yes. And so our focus is less on individual line items and more on our margins and our returns.  The second reason why we\u2019re not in a hurry and never been in hurry to raise prices is part of our vision is to remain accessible. So it\u2019s important that we\u2019ve got to source these high end premium ingredients, sustainably raise ingredient. But we want to be affordable. We want people to feel like they can come to Chipotle as often as they want once a week multiple times a week. And so we would rather err on the side of being more patient and not rushing to raise prices every time some of our ingredient costs move up so that as many people as possible can enjoy Chipotle and I think overtime that strategy has worked well for us.  And then some of the other one was on competitor impact. We generally don\u2019t see any sustained impact, when we have a competitor open up right next to us we might see a week, one week, maybe 10 days or something where we see sales will drop a little bit, there might be just curiosity where some of our customers may pick in and may grab meal at another fast casual competitor but those sales come right back, so we\u2019ve not ever seen any restaurant open at near us where they\u2019ve taken sales away from us on any kind of sustained basis. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays. Jeff Bernstein : Great, thank you very much. Two questions, one just Monty on the development side just kind of connecting the dots around what you said on the people side it seems like find the right people of what\u2019s the inhibitor and they talked about a large backlog and what not. So from a development standpoint is it really it would seem like real estate or like you said maybe increased competition to get those sites that\u2019s kind of the biggest constraint. Is that fair to say or should we assume similar to this year some of the \u201814 that you\u2019re able to upside on the unit growth or at what point maybe would we see an acceleration as the people side is well equipped. And then I had a follow up. Monty Moran : I guess I wouldn\u2019t say that real estate or people, I wouldn\u2019t really pick one of them as being the greater obstacle right now to continue growth. Our people, we feel very good about our people culture like I mentioned in my prepared remarks the ratio of the number of restaurants per field leader is much lower than its tenant in the last several years and we think that gives us a great opportunity to develop more restaurant tours and even where we\u2019re not developing restaurant tours we\u2019re developing a lot of our GMs to get much, much closer to that level. So we feel like there are (very strong) [ph] restaurants if you want to call them that are much, much better and they were getting a lot more they\u2019re getting close to that restaurant tour level. So we feel really good about that. But likewise in talking to our real estate gains they feel really good about what\u2019s out there in the real estate world granted some of the prices are going up because a lot of other concepts are also expanding and growing more quickly due to a better economy but also by the same token Chipotle is a really-really well-known name and landlords are excited to get us on their centers because they believe that we provided real boost to the excitement of their center. And so we find that we\u2019re able to get more than our fair share of deals. But in both the people side and on the real estate side we have very high standards and we want to make sure that we have loads of restaurants tours and excellent general managers and really good field leaders to open up new restaurants. And so we\u2019re always watching that carefully and not wanting to overstress the cultural side of what we do. But likewise on the real estate side we want to open aggressively but also in a measured way where we\u2019re being careful to make sure that we\u2019re selecting great-great real estate. And while we are able to go into more secondary sorts of locations than we were say 10, 11, 12, 13 years ago with much more success we still want to do that in a balanced way. So yes we agree we can over time grow faster but we don\u2019t find it super important to rush anything in that regard. What\u2019s most important to us is to continue to do a great job with our real estate and a great job with our managers and run terrific restaurants such that the demand for what we\u2019re doing continues to outstrip the supply such that when we open new restaurants we have this really great success with our new restaurant openings which I think you heard in Jack\u2019s remarks but now we\u2019re looking at sort of the 1.8 million to 1.9 million for those new restaurant openings and a great return pretty much out of the box which very quickly catches up over the next few years with these very high average unit volumes that we now have which are somewhere in the $2.47 million range per restaurant. So, by continuing to create demand we continue to have a huge opportunity out in front of us and that allows us to feel really good about our future and our growth. Jeff Bernstein : And then just to follow up on that as you mentioned kind of the increase in volumes you often talk about I guess around throughput you talk about maybe a second line that you sometimes are catering and online. Just wondering whether there is any potential or maybe in any markets you might offer two lines just some more traditional foot traffic that would seem like that would increase throughput meaningful during peak periods. I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s ever an option kind of like a (double enjoy) [ph] to for a drive through concept but the ability to just have a second line at least during certain hours of the day to really help the throughput? Is that a (brand) [ph] option? Monty Moran : Yes, Jeff I think the answer is it is an option and it\u2019s an idea that has occurred to us and we even experimented with it. But really what\u2019s most important for us is to continue to implement the four pillars of throughput because right now our average restaurant in the country does something about one third of the transactions during lunch as our fastest restaurant in the country does and so the number one opportunity for us along the main service line is that we can go much-much-much faster and we continue to -- and like I said in my remarks we have gotten quicker even though fourth quarter we\u2019re at a pace that while it\u2019s not as quick as our busiest season is close to and faster than our busiest season used to be at throughput. But we continue to make these throughput gains but we think that there is so much low hanging fruit still in terms of speeding up our restaurants in order to accommodate additional folks that adding a second line would be more disruptive to our operation and to the design of our restaurants than it would be helpful to the economic model at this point. That being said we do have to keep in mind in almost all of our restaurants a secondary client that we\u2019ve historically referred to as the fax line where we can serve catering orders out of store orders, iPhone orders and such that keeps those orders many of which are larger orders off our main service line.  Early in my comments just now I mentioned that we had tried the two line method. We have a restaurant in France at [indiscernible] which is a business center in [indiscernible] Paris where we do have -- its one really long line but people tend to go in two directions so it is two service lines with two separate areas, two separate cash registers and so forth. It works and it works just fine, like I said it\u2019s just not a strategy we need to implement right now and in that location we had a situation where we had a lot of additional square feet where we could put that in to place without losing other aspects of the operation. So, at this point we\u2019re going to continue to focus on the main service line implementing the four pillars of throughput and driving great throughput so that we can have a nice tiny efficient unit economic model. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray. Nicole Miller : Thanks. Good afternoon. Entr\u00e9e from a company or concept perspective why don\u2019t you just dictate something more structural and then you price practice that kind of systematically takes 1%, 2%, 3% a year and there is certainly patented statistical ways to do that that protects the value proposition? Also thinking about the stock perspective it seems to create a lot of volatility in the share price just from not always fully understanding or appreciating when you are or when you\u2019re not going to take price. So could you comment on it from both perspectives please? Jack Hartung : First of all, Nicole, none of our discussions about price and what we should charge and ingredients to source and what the going rates of that -- how should price additional food integrity initiatives what kind of price we should charge, none of that ever involves a discussion of the stock price. And so our belief has always been that we have the vision to change food culture the past food culture in this country and if we're successful at that we just believe that we can have lots and lots of value and we've done. We've done that I think even maybe more than a lot of people including ourselves thought were possible 8 years ago when we first went public and so we think that our vision is working or is becoming a reality. People more than ever care about where their food comes from. Recognize that Chipotle is offering something that many other restaurant companies don't or are unable to offer and so we've always been guided more by our vision than the stock price knowing that the stock price will take care of itself if we're successful.  Then back to why not choose to kind of an every year thing. It's not linear, food inflation is not linear and so we don't think our price increases should be linear and in addition to that even if you did have regular inflationary pressure, we're constantly investing in our food and so we might have significant investments that we want to make one year and in the early days when we were first introducing that for the rates needs to our market that would dictate the timing of when we will go ahead and raise prices. And so we don't think that the way our cost either because of food integrity or because of inflation is ever going to be kind of a linear one to 2% or 3% per year and so we don't think the pricing should be linear as well so that would be the way I would describe it. Nicole Miller : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Joe Buckley : Hi, thank you. Jack, did you mention a $2 million first quarter charge in connection to the pork issue and if so, could you explain? Jack Hartung : Yes, we had supplies of pork that were in various -- some of the supplies were in our restaurants, some was in our distribution centers and so the cost of removing all of that pork and disposing of it we were able to donate a lot of it, we're able to sell some of it but in that we've to take a loss Joe and so that loss will total about $2 million, we don't think it will be more than 2 million but we think it will cost about 2 million and that will here our food line during this the first quarter. Joe Buckley : Okay, is there any breach of contract this year that you should pursue? Jack Hartung : Possibly, we haven't done that yet, our first concern was what are we going to do? How are we going to make sure we don't serve this pork and we're now working with our supplier [indiscernible] what the next step is, so there is a possibility but as of right now Joe, we're going to take the hit and if there is any kind of -- the other thing is rather than go and make this a legal issue we'd like to do is we'd like to find a way to get this supplier to rise up to our protocol on a more consistent basis and so rather than this being a legal issue we'd rather look at this as how can we make sure that we can assured supply going forward and that would be more important. Joe Buckley : Okay, then maybe just one on development side Mark, I think you said you opened some lower -- the cost you decided to be a little bit lower in 2015 as you should shift away from free standing, away from the Northeast in '14 but the new store volumes are still expected to be higher. Does that again is that the message and could you just explain a little? Mark Alexee : Yes, I mean we didn't make a specific comment on where we think the new store opening levels are going to be but we're very confident in the pipeline of real estate that we have in front of us and our real estate people feel very good about it, so we have no reason to believe that we won't continue to open restaurants in that 1.8 million, 1.9 million sort of range.  The reason that we believe development costs are going to come down is people, one thing is that just in 2014 we had an unusually high number of free standards. Sometimes we sort of take what we can get that's not necessarily the result of a strategic objective to open more of them we just happen to find more of them in 2014 that met our screens and look like exciting pieces of real estate that we should build Chipotle restaurants in. In 2015 it's looking like a lot more of our mix is going to end [indiscernible] locations which tend to do wonderfully well but also tend to cost less to build, more of our bread and butter you might say. So, also we think we can get development cost down because we're working very hard from a design standpoint to implement some of our new better design methodologies but to do it in a more efficient way and to gain some economies of scale on what we're doing so we're approaching the development cost puzzle from a number of different directions but strategically we're not trying to eliminate free standards, we just understand that the [indiscernible] locations that we do very, very well with them and during 2015 it looks like more the pipeline is comprised of them than it was in 2014. Operator : We'll take our next question from Karen Houlthouse from Goldman Sachs. Karen Houlthouse : Hi, so the commentary on sequential trends and the quarter and end of January, are we to take that basically as if sales per week seasonally adjusted were flat and if so if there is still incremental opportunities on the throughput side why isn't that continuing to grow and I'm also curious it relates to sequential trends as well if you thought you were seeing any sort of benefit from the stronger low income consumer that's kind of become a buzz word across the restaurant industry given what I think is very legitimate possibility and value even to lower consumer compared to what you typically think of as a fast casual company. Jack Hartung : First of all on the sequential trends I think the answer is yes, but let me clarify that we\u2019re talking in the same language yes, for the first -- end of January for the first -- the next four and half weeks or so end of the quarter similar sales in more transactions seasonally adjusted that we saw in the fourth quarter, that would be at higher level than last year. So when you say flat yes flat sequentially but not flat compared to last year. In terms of higher throughput, higher throughput really comes in to play more or so as we move into the spring month. This is seasonally our lower average daily sales period and so throughput's important throughout the year but it becomes even more important as the weather gets nicer as more and more people are out and about and our lines tend to get a little bit longer and if our throughput is excellent at that time the lines actually won\u2019t get longer and so people will walk in a Chipotle, we serve quickly and so at that point we expect to see a benefit. In that sense Karen for us to change that trend line we\u2019re going to have to invite more customers in have faster throughput as I mentioned as we hit more of our seasonally higher sales month and hopefully we will see a trend change, very often we do see a trend change or two or three during a year was just happen to see one as we\u2019ve moved just a few weeks of the fourth quarter and into January so far.  And then in terms of the impact on the customer Chipotle has never really seen a lot of sensitivity in terms of when customers -- when the recession first hit. We weren\u2019t the first in fact we were one of the last ones to see any impact on our sales and when the recession was ending and we were coming out of recession we were one of the first ones to see a sales increase and we returned to double digit comps pretty quickly as the recession was ending. And so generally our customers come to Chipotle sure they say its great value when we do research our customers give us very, very high scores on the great value. But we have very loyal customers such that they don\u2019t stop coming to Chipotle when they have few less dollars in their pocket and then all of a sudden say, boy I\u2019m going to start going to Chipotle more often because I've got a few more bucks. I think the good news here is that people find ways to visit Chipotle and it\u2019s not necessarily affected by whether they\u2019ve got an extra bucks in their pocket. Our customer loyalty kind of overcomes these what I will call relatively minor changes in our customers' spending ability. Karen Houlthouse : And as a quick follow up, you really haven't seen sequentially trends sort of stabilized, what\u2019s the thought process around if not more explicitly addressing that with you on their spend of marketing versus the peer group, you are more explicitly addressing it in some of the -- nuts and bolts ways to get more people in the door. Jack Hartung : Well, geez, the comp was 16.1% so are you saying spend more money to get a higher than 16.1% comp? I\u2019m not sure I understand the question. Karen Houlthouse : Well sequentially things have stabilized week over week or month over month, there aren't more people coming in the door, you basically are just staring down or perpetually decelerating comp, why not be more proactive about putting things in place that will -- prevent that. Unidentified Company Representative : Well, for about -- I don't -- for over 20 years we\u2019ve been working very hard to improve every aspect of the customer experience. So for instance we've got roughly speaking the same menu we had 20 years ago. During all of those 20 years and particularly during the years since we\u2019ve been public we\u2019ve been hearing a crescendo of people wondering why we don\u2019t add additional menu items and change other aspects of what we do and yet we\u2019ve had the highest comps I think in the history of the restaurant business during that time and likewise we keep trying to improve the quality of our cultures so we have better people serving you. We\u2019ve been increasing -- improving the quality of our average raw ingredient, every ingredient we have has been under our scrutiny, in order to make sure the food test as good as it can take. Then we work on throughput to make sure that that aspect of the customer experience also improves and what we find is that by focusing on those things that we do really, really well but yet getting even better at them we\u2019ve been able to sustain a much stronger comp than any other restaurant company has done. So it may look like we\u2019re staring down the pike at sort of flattening sales and no increase in comps, it looks that way 10 years ago and nine years ago and eight years ago and seven, six, five, four three, two, one years ago I think even a year ago if you looked at what our guidance was for the year I believe at the very beginning of 2014 we said that there will be a low single digit comp I think are flat to low single digit comp and that looked like what it was going to be at the time. How did we get to a mid-to-high-teen comp doing that which we do even better and so it is possible of course that our comp will flatten out and there won\u2019t be sequential trend changes to the positive but we hope that our continued focus on trying to do everything we do better will work out just super. Operator : We\u2019ll go to next question from Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo. Jeff Farmer : Jack you touched on it but you increased your labor staffing ratios in early \u201814. I think you addressed largely the double digit transaction growth and some other things but as we\u2019re modeling the labor line in \u201815 how should we be thinking about staffing levels relative to what we saw last year, meaning you think there is another little bump in staffing levels? Are you going to hold tight with what you saw in \u201814? Jack Hartung : Jeff I wouldn\u2019t expect another bump, now we\u2019ll add people as we see more transactions so as our comps continue to be in the high single or low double digit we\u2019ll add people at kind of a normal level, I would expect that it would not be as much as we saw in the last year or so. We talk on other calls that we have some labor inefficiencies and so we have more staffing at restaurant level and I think we have just more approved that we can schedule. We have more managers, hourly or salary managers and hourly managers on our teams than ever before. And so the hours that were to appoint are higher than we think they normally should be even at these very high comps that we\u2019ve been delivering. But we\u2019ve also said we\u2019re not going to be in hurry to go shape those inefficiencies out of the restaurant. It\u2019s been an extraordinary year in terms of throughput, in terms of transaction, we\u2019ve moved to a whole another sales level here. And so the fact that we\u2019ve had some what I call relatively modest labor inefficiencies somewhere in the maybe 50, 60, 70 basis points kind of range. We\u2019re not going to be in a hurry to shape that loose. We\u2019re aware of it, our teams are aware it and so I wouldn\u2019t see additional inefficiencies creep in and at some point in the future I just wouldn\u2019t want to pinpoint when, we believe we will get this efficiency back but I wouldn\u2019t see a similar kind of step up for the reasons I just mentioned. I think you will see another layer of inefficiency creep in like you\u2019ve seen in the last year and half. Jeff Farmer : Just one quick follow up, so excluding stock-based comp, which means that clearly that we still need to figure out what that number potentially could be, so again excluding stock-based comp how should we be thinking about G&A dollar growth in \u201815 or even absolute sort of G&A dollars in \u201815? Jack Hartung : Yes, I would expect at this level Jeff, that our G&A excluding non-cash comp and excluding any kind of one-time things that might happen will be at a similar but hopefully slightly lower as a percentage of sales. There is not a ton of leverage but I would say there is slight leverage that hopefully we will get as I would expect the G&A as a percentage of sales anything stock comp should drift slightly lower over the coming years. Operator : And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mark Alexee for any additional or closing remarks. Mark Alexee : Thank you for joining us. We really appreciate it. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter for our first quarter financial results. Thanks. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Investor Relations Manager for Chipotle Mexican Grill, Mr. Mark Alexee. You may begin your conference. Mark Alexee : Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the first quarter 2015. It may also be found on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the Securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements about our potential business results, growth in shareholder returns, projections of a number of restaurants we intend to open and trends and development costs, estimates of future and comparable restaurant sales increases or comps, and supply chain and other trends affecting future comps, projections regarding trends in food, labor and general and administrative costs, our expected effective tax rate, statements about stock repurchases as well as other statements of our expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today and we are not assuming any obligation to update them. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated on our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks. I'd like to remind everyone that we have adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period begins on the first day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the second quarter, it will begin June 1 and continue through our Q2 earnings release in July 2015. On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Monty Moran, Co-Chief Executive Officer; Mark Crumpacker, Chief Creative and Development Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve. Steve Ells : Thank you, Mark. I'm pleased with our performance during the first quarter. 2014 was an extraordinary year for our business and we're off to a strong start in 2015. During the quarter, we generated revenue of nearly $1.1 billion, an increase of 20% on comparable restaurant sales growth of 10.4% and the opening of 49 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings of $2.88 per share, an increase of 47%. These results are particularly strong considering that we were up against 13.4% same-store sales growth in Q1 last year and faced with harsh winter conditions in much of the country, including many important Chipotle markets. We also saw some challenges related to our decision to stop serving carnitas in some of our restaurants. However, the strength of our business has weathered these challenges and emerged to set us up for a great year in 2015. Our performance is the direct result of our continued focus on the things that really drive our business, our unique food culture and our unique people culture. We have a strong history of establishing very high standards for food we serve. Standards that are very often hard to meet, given our requirements for the ingredients we use. We have encountered challenges from time-to-time, since we began our journey to find the very best ingredients we can, and we do not anticipate our recent pork supply issue to be our last one. But our track record of driving positive change in these areas is unprecedented, and we believe these higher quality ingredients taste better. In January, we suspended one of our pork suppliers after a supply chain audit found that they were not fully compliant with all of our standards. Our protocol requires that pigs are raised with access to the outdoors or deep bedding in barns and without the use of antibiotics. These differences are in stark contrast to the way conventional pigs are raised. In many cases they spend their whole lives indoors, on hard slatted floors with no bedding, which we think is inhumane. When we found that one of our suppliers was falling short on some of our requirements, we knew that removing this pork from our supply was the right thing to do. But our decision left us without enough pork, and the resulting outages affected more than one-third of our restaurants. While many of our customers were incredibly proud that we took a stand to do what was right, we also knew that there was risks involved, and that we would encounter challenges in replacing this supply. There is very little cushion today in the supply system for pork that meets our standards, and ultimately the solution requires increasing the number of pigs that are available. This does not happen quickly. Recognizing this near-term supply constraint, we have been looking hard to find more pork that meets our protocols. Our long-term suppliers have partnered with us to increase their output of responsibly raise pork. However, this alone will not be enough to remedy the situation, and our shortage will remain at more than one-third of our restaurants, as we enter the peak spring and summer periods. We have also looked at the possibility of adding new suppliers and have explored options to use other types of pork as a way to get more supply. Each of these potential solutions has their own unique complications. That said, we now believe that we have found a solution with a new supplier to help us fill our gap. Our team is conducting on-site visits to inspect all facets of the operation, and we're encouraged by what we have seen so far. At this point, we plan to begin introducing this new pork in some of our restaurants in the coming months. If all goes as planned, we believe that we will be steadily increasing our supply throughout the third quarter and back in full supply during the fourth quarter. While the commitments we make and the way we run our business can be difficult, they are also helping to differentiate Chipotle and enabling us to build stronger relationships with our customers, particularly younger customers. New research out during the quarter from investment firm shows that the fast-casual sector has surpassed casual dining in terms of frequency of visits, with 45% of consumers saying that they spend more money eating out in 2014, up from 37% in 2013, and pointing to gains in popularity amongst fast-casual restaurants. In this study Chipotle was named as the favorite restaurant more than any other, with twice as many mentions as the number two company on the list. Another study shows that millennials, key customers for Chipotle, are eating out at fast-casual restaurants more than generation X-ers or boomers, and that their dissatisfaction with traditional fast food is higher than other generations. We believe that the loyalty that we're building with key customer groups is very much a result of our commitment to doing what is right, in addition to the excellent customer service that we provide. As we move closer to resolving the supply issues that have left us short of carnitas, we believe the pieces are in place for us to deliver strong performance throughout the year, and to help us continue to change the way people think about any fast food. I'll now turn the call over to Monty. Montgomery Moran : Thank you, Steve. Our ability to continue to deliver excellent results depends on the continued success of the special people culture that we have created at Chipotle. This culture continues to provide an extraordinary restaurant experience, while simultaneously allowing us to develop the excellent leaders we will need to accommodate our future growth, and help us to maintain our strong unit economic model. During the quarter, we continue to strengthen our restaurant teams, adding 42 new restaurateur and promoting 11 in the field leadership roles, either Apprentice Team Leaders or Area Managers. These leaders are able to attract very talented people to our company and develop them to reach their full potential. By hiring only top-performing employees and developing them to be at their very best, we're able to do things in our restaurants that other restaurant companies simply can't do. Not only our team is running extraordinary restaurants, preparing delicious food using classic cooking techniques and providing exceptional customer service, we're also elevating the people around them. This approach to running our restaurants is what enables us to create such an extraordinary dining experience and to deliver such strong unit economics. The strength of our culture is evident in many ways, including through a growing number of individual success stories, as more and more of our people are climbing the ladder from crew to management and field leadership positions as well. In fact, last year alone, we promoted more than 10,500 people, who started as crew, into management positions. More than 78% of our restaurateur started with us as crew, many having never even worked in a restaurant before. During the quarter, one particular leader really captured our attention, [ph] Montel Milleage, who demonstrated his ability to assemble a team of all top performers, and then empower them to achieve high standards in his restaurant, became our youngest restaurateur ever at only 19 years old. Montel came to Chipotle two years ago, discouraged by his first job in a fast food restaurant. He wanted to work in an environment where the circumstances were encouraging and where he saw opportunities to advance, learn and grow. He came to our College Park restaurant in Maryland for interview and was hired on the spot. He had a group of very strong leaders such as [ph] Gabby Fertio who is now a restaurateur, and [ph] Patricia Aguila a restaurateur who has been promoted to field leader and is now actually a team leader at Chipotle. His team immediately recognized that despite not having significant experience, Montel embodied the 13 characteristics of a top performer and the drive to empower others around him. A year later he was a Service Manager working to develop his replacement, so he can move to the apprentice role. And in 19, he was promoted to General Manager at a new Chipotle restaurant, when we opened in Maryland City. From the beginning, Montel set his sight on developing a team of all top performers. He then shared his restaurateur vision with all of them and connected with each person on his team by getting to know them, sharing his own dreams and desires, and demonstrating to them how he could help them become leaders in their own right. Montel's story is just one of a number of truly inspiring stories of people who come to Chipotle, are motivated by our food culture and our people culture, and who share our vision and work hard to achieve it. These stories really illustrate the opportunities we're offering at Chipotle to top performers who are able to deliver a fantastic customer experience, and elevate the people around them to help them reach their potential. These opportunities are not only very rewarding to those who take advantage of them, they also provide the people that we will need to lead our continued growth at Chipotle. One of the greatest benefits of having such strong cultures in our restaurants is that it enables us to deliver excellent customer service, which among other things generates great throughput. Our teams understand that the qualities that makes a great throughput are exactly the same qualities that provide the very best customer service. Having everything ready in a restaurant before customers arrive, so we're prepared for service, particularly in our busiest times, and clear authentic communication with customers to keep our lines moving quickly without making people feel rushed. We continue to increase our average transactions throughout the day, including our peak lunch and peak dinner hours. During the quarter we increased average transactions by 21 across the entire day, a tremendous accomplishment. This continued improvement is the product of our outstanding restaurant teams and their ongoing attention to providing better service, but also our continued emphasis on the four pillars of throughput, which are using a linebacker and dedicated expo at peak times, proper mise en place, and having the very best person in each position on the line during our busiest times. Since we started reporting on the progress, our restaurants are making and implementing these four pillars. We've seen continued improvement and throughput, which we believe will become increasingly important now, as we head into our busiest months of the year. Finally, on the development front, we are well on track to meet our initial guidance to open 190 to 205 new restaurants during this year. During the quarter, we opened 49 new restaurants, including one new ShopHouse, bringing our total number of restaurants to 1,831, including 10 ShopHouses and two Pizzeria Locales. We continue to have a very strong real estate pipeline and are increasing our mix of new construction deals. Building restaurants in newly constructed centers is less costly for us. So this increase in new development should help offset some of the higher development cost that we saw in 2014. We're continuing to evaluate new market opportunities or proceeds and anticipate entering new markets for both ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale this year. We previously announced our plans to introduce Pizzeria Locale in Kansas City and also expect to open in the third market Cincinnati, later this year. We're pleased with our results for the quarter and our start to 2015. The strong food culture, unique and empowering people culture and industry-leading unit economics, we're well-positioned to change the way people think about and eat fast food and to deliver outstanding results for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Crumpacker : Thanks, Monty. The marketing we do at Chipotle is unlike that of any other fast food brand. The reason for this is simple, very early on we decided to spend more on our ingredients and less on our marketing. It's always been our belief that better quality food prepared by hand and served by excellent teams would be the most powerful marketing of all. In fact, we were serving better ingredients, including pasteurized dairy, local produce and meats without antibiotics or hormones long before there was even significant customer demand for such things. Over time, this has created powerful differentiation between Chipotle and other fast food brands. This approach has served us well and our ongoing marketing research makes us confident that this is the case. Chipotle has become quite buzz-worthy with awareness coming from social medial, public relations, advertising and our local and event marketing programs. But with less reliance on traditional advertising than many of our [technical difficulty] strength of our programs in areas other than advertising, generates considerable attention and awareness and as does the breakthrough nature of our content programs, which have reached well beyond what we would get through traditional advertising. We are also seeing greater interest among customers who are looking to eat healthier and defining healthy around such characteristics as natural and minimally processed ingredients, exactly the same kind of ingredients we use to make our food. And we are also seeing that a majority of customers, about 60%, are willing to pay more for better food, food that is made without artificial ingredients. All of these findings really support the way we run our business and our marketing, and all the trades that are reflected in various aspects of our marketing. The vast majority of fast food brands use limited time offers, new menu items and price promotions as their core marketing strategy. These new menu items and offers rarely build long-term loyal customers, instead only provides a spike in sales during their advertising window. In order to maintain traffic, most fast food brands need to add a steady stream of new menu items throughout the year, resulting in bloated menus filled with hundreds of menu items. Not only is this marketing approach incredibly expensive, the cluttered menus can be confusing to customers and difficult for the restaurant crews to execute. But the most significant downside to this approach is that these new menu items are often made from cheap artificial ingredients and are highly processed. These menus of highly processed items are proving problematic, as customers are increasingly concerned with a long list of artificial ingredients found in foods today. There are more than 800 artificial ingredients, preservatives and processing aids used in processed foods. In fact, there are 85 ingredients in a single fast food burrito served by one of our competitors. For years our marketing has touted the superiority of our ingredients, including our use of local produce, pasteurize dairy and meats without antibiotics and added hormones. But more recently we have begun to expand our marketing messages to highlight the small number of whole unprocessed ingredients used in our food. In fact, there are only 68 ingredients used to prepare all of the food we serve at Chipotle, the vast majority of which are simple ingredients you could buy at the local market. Only our tortillas contain any preservatives or other additives, and we are diligently working to eliminate those. The fact that Chipotle uses better quality ingredients is well-known, but the fact that our food contains virtually none of these artificial ingredients and other fast food contains literally hundreds of them will further differentiate Chipotle from the competition. That's why we have developed a new marketing platform called, collective beauty, which is our internal designation for the program that highlights the simple beauty of the minimal number of whole unprocessed ingredients in our food. The campaign include several phases and will be rolled out over the coming years. Currently, the campaign is running in print, outdoor and radio across 30 of our top markets. Additionally, we are running more national advertising than ever before, leveraging print, streaming radio, search and social. The campaign runs in two flights, one this spring and another this fall. During the summer break between advertising flights, we'll be launching a large online initiative for collective beauty. Beyond this expansion of our marketing strategy, strengthening our ecommerce program is a top priority for us this year. Over the last year we worked on a project to incorporate mobile payment into Chipotle ordering apps. We had hoped that this capability would have been available in the updated app released in December 2014, but we were not happy with how it was working, particularly in light of the continually evolving landscape of mobile payment. Our commitment to support mobile payments is not changed, but our approach has. We are broadening our view of mobile payment to include more than simply paying for in-restaurant transactions using our app. Our near-term priorities with regard to mobile include the launch of an ordering app for Apple Watch, which will be available April 24, and the exploration of new systems for mobile payment, including the use of Apple Pay in our restaurants and our iOS app and potentially Google Wallet capability within our Android app. We are making progress with all of these initiatives and we'll keep you apprised, as these programs evolve. Last, we also relaunched our chipotle.com website with better accessibility and functionality for mobile users. Additionally, we have begun delivery of online and mobile orders for individual and small groups in 67 cities using the Postmates delivery app. We selected Postmates as our official delivery partner in March, and now they are currently delivering Chipotle orders in all of the markets where they operate. Finally, with regard to our catering programs, we will begin advertising catering in a number of markets, as we get close to graduation season, historically a busy season for catering packages. And expect to see continued momentum in this area during that peak time. With that, I'll turn it over to Jack. John Hartung : Thanks Mark. We're very proud of our results for the quarter, as we grew our revenue to nearly $1.1 billion or 20% increase as compared to last year and EPS was up 47% in the quarter. Our average restaurant volumes have surpassed the $2.5 million mark for the first time, and we sit to little more than three years ago that our average volumes passed $2 million for the first time, meaning that we've been able to increase our average volumes by more than $500,000 per restaurant, while adding more than 600 new restaurants during the past three years. This obviously has had a significant positive affect on our unit economics, and it means we're serving more Chipotle to more and more people in new and existing restaurants, as we pursue our vision to change the way people think about any fast food. As you know, this year we faced the most difficult comp comparisons we've ever had as a public company, including lapping the menu price increase from Q2 of last year. We're pleased with the 10.4% comp in the quarter, on top of the 13.4% comp from last year. And we believe the comp was affected by weather, especially in parts of the Mid-Atlantic, the North East and regions in the south, and by the pork shortage, which Steve talked about. It's difficult to put a precise impact on the combined effect of weather and the pork shortage during the quarter, but we believe the comp could have been as much as 100 basis points to 200 basis points higher with normalized weather, and had we've been able to serve carnitas in all of our restaurants. And it's not possible to separate the weather impact from the effect of the pork shortage, since they happened at roughly the same time. We normally talk about weather not having a net impact on our sales, because our sales typically come roaring back after big snowstorm, offsetting the lower sales caused by the storm. But the weather impact this year lasted for many weeks in most markets, so any sales bounce back could not offset the full effect of the bad weather. Our comps were highest in January and lowest in March, similar to some macro retail trends, and consistent with the premise that the weather was likely a factor in February, March. Until so far, in April, are trending slightly higher than March, which tells us that weather was at least partially a factor in the first quarter. So what does all that mean for our sales trend going forward? Well, comps in April so far appear on track to be in the high-single digits, and we think our pork shortage is currently impacting our sales by as much as 200 basis points. We have not seen immediate impact on sales when market first ran out of pork, but a research in our sales analysis suggest that our carnitas customers really love our pork, and they appear to be visiting less often or not at all, until they know we have carnita skin in their market. Now, this is not surprising, as the vast majority of our customers tend to find their favorite burrito or favorite bowl combination, and then they order that favorite meal every single time they visit. We had hope that the shortage would encourage our carnitas customers to try another menu option, and some did, but many have decided to hold out until carnitas returns to their market. And as a reminder, we rotated markets without pork about every six weeks, and so every one of our markets has been affected at some time or another. We found that when we rotated supply back to a particular market, it can take weeks before our carnitas product mix returns to previous product mix levels. As a result of our carnitas loving customers not realize we were back in supply of carnitas, until they visited less often. In other words, this rolling blackout has caused confusion among our customers about where and when we were out of carnitas, and this has worsened the sales impact. Because of this phenomenon, we're going to stop the rolling blackout and continuously serve carnitas in our markets, where the carnitas product mix tends to be the highest, starting later this month. Based on actual April trends and factoring in a tougher comparisons in May and June, including the lapping of last year's menu price increase, Q2 comps overall are likely to be in the low-to-mid single digits. So that comp assumes that we continue to see as much as 200 basis points negative impact from the pork shortage. As Steve mentioned, we expect additional pork to be returning to our restaurants beginning in the third quarter, with a full return of carnitas during the fourth quarter. It also assumes no incremental menu price increase in Q2 related to the elevated beef prices, which I'll talk about in a few minutes. And also as before any potential sales lift we might get from our marketing campaign that Mark talked about or from other impact such as faster throughput. By the way, of the 10.4% comp in the quarter, about 6.1% relates to the price increase from last year, and most of the rest is due to higher traffic with a small increase in average check due to positive mix, including greater group size and catering. Of course, we're as disappointed as our carnitas loving customers that we have not been able to satisfy their craving, and we don't love the fact that are sales have been impacted by the shortage. But we remain committed to our food integrity mission, and we are as confident as ever that we made the right decision to suspend a pork supplier based on our animal welfare protocols. And we're optimistic that the new pork supplier Steve talked about will help us at least reduce the impact of this shortage on our customers and on our sales soon. Overall, for the year, we continue to expect comps in a low-to-mid single digit, which is consistent with the outlook we initially provided for the year. And again, this does not factor in any menu price increases related to beef or any sales recovery from eliminating the pork shortage. We're pleased to finally see some relief on our food cost line, with food cost declining from 35% in the fourth quarter to 33.9% in Q1. The main contributors to the decrease were from relief in dairy cost and favorable pricing for avocados. Dairy pricing had largely been expected to be realized with a broader commodity market increased supply during the fourth quarter of 2014, and the trend was relatively stable throughout the quarter. With avocado pricing, we have observed a slight increase in supply, and that temporarily helped to keep the prices reasonable through the early months of 2015. However, we anticipate that normal seasonal shifts will pressure the avocado market in Q2 and Q3, as we buy more avocados from California growers. Beef prices remain at historically high levels, although beef inflation was largely contained during the quarter. We currently believe that the pricing for beef will remain at these elevated levels well into 2016 and perhaps even into 2017. As a result of this increased inflation, we expect to raise prices on steak and barbacoa this year, most likely by the end of the third quarter. And while we're still carefully reviewing our options, we anticipate an average increase of around 4% to 6%, which would have a net effect of about 150 basis points based on the current product mix of our steak and barbacoa. And as you'll recall, our intent last year was to cover the inflationary cost pressures of beef, but we undershot this level in hindsight, as beef cost continued to rise. And while it's important to our vision that we remain accessible or affordable to our customers, we also want to charge our customers the going rate for the ingredients that we use. And as a reminder, we saw virtually no trade down from steak and barbacoa last year, when we increased prices for these entrees more than other menu items. One final note related to food cost in the quarter. We included a one-time write-off to the cost of sales associated with the carnitas inventory of $1.7 million. We chose to donate rather than serve the pork which did not meet our protocols. This write-off was offset by a small change in the classification of miscellaneous kitchen supplies, which shifted from the food cost line to the other operating cost during the quarter. Labor costs for the first quarter were 22.4% of sales, a decrease of 60 basis points from last year. Leverage for the quarter was largely driven by higher sales volumes, which include the benefit of the higher menu prices and that was slightly offset by wage inflation. Occupancy costs were 5.8% of sales, a decrease of 30 basis points from last year. And other operating costs were 10.4% of sales or 10 basis points lower than last year. Marketing expenses during the quarter were 0.9% of sales compared to 1.3% in the prior year, and that's in line with expectations and lower than our full year outlook, as we will ramp up additional marketing costs during Q2 and Q3 related to the campaign that Mark discussed. Restaurant level margins increased 160 basis points to 27.5% benefiting from strong revenue growth compared to last year. G&A was 5.8% of sales in the quarter, down from 7.4% last year and was driven by the lower non-cash stock comp. For the full year 2015, we expect non-cash stock comp expense to be about $80 million, which is down $18 million from last year. Executive comp was restructured resulting in an estimated $33 million reduction, and exec comp for the full year, while additional grants to restaurant management and staff are expected to offset the non-cash stock comp by about $15 million. Total stock comp in the first quarter was about $16.6 million compared to about $27.6 million last year. As Mark mentioned earlier, we are refocusing our ecommerce program to build a mobile platform that moves beyond simply incorporating mobile payment into our ordering app. We incurred a loss on disposal of assets, about $2.8 million associated with some of the prior development work. Effective tax rate during the quarter was 38.4% and for the full year we estimate our effective tax rate will be 38.7% compared to 37.6% for the full year in 2014. 2014 benefited from our estimated usable federal and state credits and from the work opportunity and R&D federal tax credit, which have not been renewed for 2015. If those federal credits are extended to 2015, we estimate our tax rate would benefit by about 30 basis points. We finished the quarter with 1,831 restaurants and our average unit volumes have helped push our return on investment up to nearly 80%, an economic return that we're very proud to achieve. As of March 31, we held cash and investments of about $1.4 billion including short and long-term interest bearing investments and we continue to have no debt on our balance sheet. During the quarter, we repurchased $23 million of our stock on average share price of $675 and we currently have $179 million remaining on our share buyback program, which was previously approved by our Board. We continue to believe that reinvesting into the growth of our business remains the best use of our cash, although we'll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock to enhance shareholder value. Thanks for your time today and we'd be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And at this time, we'll take a question from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Co. Brian Bittner : So a question on comps, and I'm just trying to understand the way you are thinking about it. Over the next two quarters, you're facing very similar traffic comparisons that you faced in the first quarter. So are you assuming that over the next couple of quarters, you see very similar traffic growth that you saw in this first quarter, which I'm assuming is in the low-singles, and then you're just rolling in the loss of the pricing as it falls off? Is that kind of how you're thinking about comps going forward? John Hartung : No, I think the comparisons get tougher, and so I would expect that the transaction comps are not going to hold up at the same level as the first quarter. The way I would think about it is, in April so far we're seeing comps in the high single-digit range, and that includes menu pricing of about 6.1%. That menu pricing will fall off over the next few quarters. And so as that 6.1% falls off, you're going to see transactions that are going to be moving down into the low single-digits. And then we continue to compare it to tougher comparisons as the year rolls out. So I would not expect to see the same transaction growth as you saw in the first quarter continue as we move to the rest of the year. Brian Bittner : And then, second and last question. How much is your online orders as a percent of your sales mix today? And as you focus on it, what really are the benefits and where could it go in your mind as a percent of the business? John Hartung : What I include as kind of all online and catering and burritos by the box, they're all kind of non-traditional orders. That was about 6.6% during the quarter. That's at or near an all-time peak. That number will vary quarter-by-quarter, because catering has seasonality. Mark mentioned in his comments that we're approaching our peak catering season. And so I would expect that catering would move up in Q2, and I would expect that 6.6% to increase along with the higher catering expected in the next quarter. We don't know where it can go, but we do know some competitors talk about their total catering in the 8%, 9%, 10% range. And so we think we've got a lot of room to grow. Catering is very young. We still think that our mobile ordering as Mark talked about, we could do a lot more with the ordering, with the payment, with the way that we accommodate those orders in restaurants. So we think we have a lot of room to do a better job with all that. In terms of where it can go, we don't know. We just know others when they're in high single-digits, low double-digits, that gives us optimism that we can move that number up from the 6.6% today. Mark Crumpacker : And just to add on to that, with regard to catering, keep in mind that catering currently does not have online ordering or delivery or online payment. So it's in its very early stages. So if we add those things, we expect to see catering become more popular. With regard to online orders, I can't give you one statistic with regard to the Postmates delivery service that we're using. We're seeing a 30% month-over-month growth on those orders, and we have not publicized this. So there is a tremendous amount of potential for individual orders, but it's a little bit too early for us to predict what long-term impact that will have. Operator : At this time, we'll take a question from Joseph Buckley with Bank of America. Joseph Buckley : Can I just ask you to clarify the last discussion, so the 6.6% is the percent of online orders, but if I understand correctly, that does not include catering? Is that correct? John Hartung : Joe, that does include catering. So catering is a little over 1%, so of that 6.6% catering is about 1.1% or so. But we didn't cater in the second quarter, it could increase by as much as 50%, so it could be in a 1.5% or 1.6% range or so, but the 6.6% does include catering. Joseph Buckley : And then just a question on the food costs, which you are commenting remarkably good for the quarter, given the recent run rate. Was there some unusual letup on the pressure from beef during the first quarter or was that simply dairy and avocado and some other things coming in more favorable than you expected? John Hartung : Joe it was all dairy and avocados. Beef just kind of held constant. We pickup about two-thirds of the benefit from dairy, and about a-third of the benefit from avocados, and then we just had no other surprises. We've been kind of snake bit in the last several quarters just by surprising continued increase, whether it was beef or some other ingredients. And this quarter everything remain calm, and we got the benefit that we hoped we would get from avocados and dairy, so nothing else out of the ordinary. Joseph Buckley : Is there any unusual split between advertising expense for the balance of the year? I know, you said, it was down as a percent of sales in the first quarter? John Hartung : Yes, Joe, I would expect Q2 and Q3 to probably be at the peak. This quarter was closer to 1%, just under 1%. Q2 and Q3 will be closer to 2%. And then a overall for the year, fourth quarter will dropdown to something maybe closer to 1%. Overall for the year, we'll probably be in the 1.6% range or so. Operator : At this time, we'll go to Jason West with Credit Suisse. Jason West : Just one, I guess, going back on the delivery rollout. You said that's going to be delivery to individuals as well. Is that something you guys have offered? I mean, I'm guessing you can do it on like seamless and places like that, but is that sort of a new initiative and how widespread will that delivery be? Is that a nationwide opportunity? Mark Crumpacker : Yes, it is relatively new -- let me put it this way. There have been a lot of people that have been delivering Chipotle through various services over the years. And we've tried to in a lot of cases shut them down, because we weren't sure whether the quality was going to be sufficient or whether they were following our rules. This is different because we've made an official deal with Postmates and they have been delivering Chipotle for a quite a while too. So we have them as our official partner, and they will be delivering Chipotle, they are delivering Chipotle in all of their markets which are -- its 64 cities and about 24 big metropolitan areas. So it is nationwide. Jason West : And I guess going back to the comp question. The underlying, I guess, trends, do you guys assume the two year is going to deteriorate for any reason, particularly looking at maybe the traffic specifically on that? And I guess, around that question, is there anything you're seeing outside of the weather and the pork issues that suggest there to be any reason for a deceleration in the underlying trend of the business? John Hartung : Well, I don't know that I will look at a two-year trend. I think when you combine years you have to combine years that make up the full trend that we're seeing. And in our case, I go back to the current trend we're in. We're in a third-year of a trend that started in early 2013. If you remember our comp in 2013 was 1% and the year before that we were on a kind of deceleration as we were finishing up a three-year trend that started in 2010. And so if you go back to 2013 and you look we grew comps from 1% and 5% and 6% and 9% and we went to double-digits and now we're comparing against those strong double digits. And I think if you combine those three years together, you will see a three-year trend that for the first quarter with 2015 being the third year, the comp was about 24.8%. Now, we know that was affected by weather and pork and so it was depressed a little bit. But if you make an adjustment for weather and pork, I think for the rest of the year, you can think in terms of a three year combine sales comp and that would put you in kind of 25%, 26% range or so. And I think that's the better way to think about it. So in those terms I think that we should stay in that same kind of ballpark. And again that doesn't take into account anything we do with menu prices on beef and it doesn't take into account the replenishment of supply with the pork that Steve talked about later in the year. Operator : At this time, we'll hear from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird. David Tarantino : Just maybe a follow-up on that question, Jack. I guess, if you think about the trends on a multi-year basis and apply that logic, would you expect this year's traffic or the one year traffic number to turn negative at any point during the year? I guess, does that imply sort of a flattening out of the traffic or a turning of the traffic to negative territory? John Hartung : I don't think, David, it will turn negative, but when we compare against the third quarter that's going to be our toughest comparison. And it's going to be low-single digits. So I don't think it will turn negative. I hope that we see a balance from things like creating greater awareness with the campaign that Mark talked about, and just general increase in awareness that we from time-to-time get with Chipotle. It's amazing to me that some people still have never visited Chipotle. I just met one over the weekend. I just can't believe it that somebody has never been to Chipotle. And so the third quarter will be the toughest test, but I would say right now I don't expect it to turn negative. David Tarantino : And then, I guess, getting back to your point there that you just made, in the past I think this is pretty similar to how you've given guidance yet in the past. Chipotle, time and time again has found a way to drive more traffic into the business through, whether it's marketing or just initiatives around food or throughput. So I guess this year, it sounds like maybe you're less optimistic about your ability to drive more traffic or maybe I'm reading it the wrong way, but what are your overall thoughts on the ability to continue driving this up and kind of hurdle over the great trends you had last year with positive momentum? John Hartung : David, it's very hard to predict quarter-by-quarter. I look at this as a very substantial three-year trend where we now have 1,800 restaurants; we're now $2.5 million. In fact, that we've had a $500,000 in volume, while adding the 600 restaurants I talked about, over the last three years I think is pretty substantial. If you go back to the three years before that that was a three-year trend as well that had a start and a stop. And it was pretty clean. 2010, 2011, and 2012, during that three-year period, and you see where it started, you can see where it ended and that was about 27% or 28% or 29% increase. And so we seem to have these waves. And if you go back even as we were private company, these waves where people figure out that Chipotle exist, they will like it, that they come back more often. And so we have this kind of surge and then we have a leveling off, then a surge and a leveling off, very tough to predict. Will we have another surge? When will we have it? What will the magnitude of that surge be? But we continue to believe that there's a great appreciation and a growing appreciation for what we do at Chipotle. We do think millennials in particular are very appreciative of what we do. We think this campaign that's designed to reinforce the idea that not only do we source sustainable raised ingredients, but we do really cooking with real whole ingredients. And we largely don't use things like preservatives and stabilizers and things like that. So we believe that that is not something that is short-lived, that's over. We think that we'll probably benefit from that, but in terms of then breaking that down into exactly what that's going to do for next two or three quarters, it's tougher to predict and the comparisons are tough, but over the longer term, we're optimistic about where we can go from here. Operator : And then we'll take a question from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John Glass : Jack, just first on the food cost outlook for the full year, just to be clear, is the $33.9 million -- I know there's lots of pushes and pulls, but is that a good number? Doesn't that also include the write-off of the pork, so was that even better or is that a loss on this asset or something? John Hartung : Well, the write-off of the pork is offset by re-class. And so I would look at those as largely a loss. So I would think of it, John, as we're going to see pressure in the next two quarters from avocados, and so I think they will be in that pressure. Hopefully that pressure will be relieved in the fourth quarter. So I would say generally, we will probably be up a little bit from this first quarter, but hopefully not too significant. John Glass : So still below, say, the 35% that you're running at the end of last year, is that a fair way to think about -- ? John Hartung : We expect to see below the 35%, yes. John Glass : And then are your restaurant set up now that take mobile payments? Do you have to invest more in the POS systems or different POS systems? How do you envision this new mobile payment system working with your existing systems? Mark Crumpacker : The restaurants currently are not set up to accept mobile pay, although with Apple Pay, in particular, the investment on the hardware side is relatively minimal. So that's not a significant barrier. The main challenge there is making the POS software compliant with Apple Pay. So we're working on that. And that's the type of payment that's of most interest to us, so people being able to pay at the POS with their phone. We're also of course pursuing putting Apply Pay in our mobile app as well as Google Wallet in our Android app. But the priority is going to be mobile payment at the POS. But it's not as if the POS hardware has to change, there's just an additional piece of equipment. John Glass : And do you envision that being available this year? Mark Crumpacker : That's our hope to have that implemented by the end of the year. Operator : And this time we'll move to Andrew Charles with Cowen and Company. Andrew Charles : Monty, with the combined power of increased field leadership oversight in diagnostic tool, do you see the 21 transaction gain sustainable for the remainder of 2015? Montgomery Moran : Do I see the, what transactions? Andrew Charles : The 21 transactions you gained from the throughput initiatives. Do you see that's sustainable with the tools you're putting in place? Montgomery Moran : Yes, in fact, I would like to see us actually improve on that over the next two quarters. That's a nice result especially during the first quarter, which from a transaction standpoint is one of our slowest two quarters. And over the second and third quarter we usually see a significant pick up in our business seasonally. And it's during those seasons that we really make sure to emphasize with all of our teams, the importance of having those four pillars in place. And in fact, at this time we've just started a national sort of throughput contest just to sort of make it top of mind with our restaurant teams, have some fun with it and bring awareness to those who are doing the best job just like we did with the reporting at nationwide from team director to team director, but this way we're actually having a little bit of a contest for bragging, right. And we'll see if we can keep pushing the needle, but I think it's going to get stronger over the next two quarters in terms of throughput. Now, of course, our ability to put through more people depends on having more people come to our doors as well. So throughput will not in and of itself drive transactions, it's just that when you have transactions come in, if you don't have the throughput, you are stifling your ability to allow those additional transactions to come in the door. But yes, we're excited about hopefully continuing to improve on our execution of the four pillars and our execution of throughput. Andrew Charles : And Mark, with the new digital initiatives what can we expect from one-to-one marketing efforts? And how can Chipotle build efforts to strengthen this form of marketing? Mark Crumpacker : I missed out the second part of the question. Andrew Charles : Yes, sure, just kind of curious about how Chipotle can build efforts to strengthen the one-to-one marketing? Mark Crumpacker : Well, I mean, we've been doing that actually for a couple of years. We've significantly improved our one-to-one marketing through mobile. What we're doing now is doing more marketing campaigns that enable people to participate by opting in either through email or via text. As I mentioned in my comments earlier, we just relaunched chipotle.com yesterday, which makes it mobile-friendly, much easier for people to opt into our emails and follow us on our social media accounts. We're also, as Jeff mentioned, I think on the last earnings call, doing a large data project at Chipotle, which will give us even more capability in terms of reaching out to these folks, but we have seen a shift in our marketing toward more one-to-one marketing in terms of what we're spending anyway. So I think we're already underway in that regard. Andrew Charles : But it seems like the digital initiative will give you more firepower behind that. Mark Crumpacker : Well, anything that we do that's digital has the potential for people to share it them by themselves, so it adds a viral element. And at Chipolata, we're very judicious with our offers. And when we combine our mobile initiative with an offer of some kind, we see a tremendous amount of viral pickup of that. And so, yes, these digital initiatives have given us more leverage for our dollars than traditional advertising do or does. We use them always in conjunction with one another, but you're right digital gives us more leverage because of the potential for it to be shared. Operator : At this time, we'll take a question from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : I had a question about the supply chain and obviously with carnitas, it's had a little bit about a bump more recently. But given the size of the company and the growth path, can you talk about maybe the potential or the partner with larger entities to ensure the supply chain going forward? It just seems like you'll be a very attractive partner and maybe you already are doing that, and it's just not obvious to us on the outside is try to ensure the consistency of the supply. Steve Ells : Well, our suppliers are some of the larger suppliers in the country. Our suppliers are also very small independent family farms that are sometimes part of larger cooperatives. But we buy from some of the very, very bigger suppliers. With the bigger suppliers we've encouraged them to adopt our protocols, and some of them have, and some have chose not to do so. But we know in order to continue to ensure a supply of our top quality ingredients that are more sustainably raised, we're going to have to use all different sizes of farmers and ranches out there, and we have been doing that for years. Operator : At this time, we'll take from David Palmer with RBC. David Palmer : A quick follow-up and then another question. With regard to pricing, Jack, you mentioned that you think the traffic will remain positive. If traffic were approaching negative territory, does that change your resolve to raise pricing or do you think of this independent of what your traffic is doing? John Hartung : Well, trends don't change. We're likely going to increase prices, if something happened in the economy or something happen with our trends, we might differ it. I mentioned that we'd probably get it done by the end of the third quarter. So if we saw something unusual happen, we might differ it, just so that we don't exasperate the challenge. But if the trends stay as they are, we're underpriced on steak right now. We're just not charging to going to rate. We actually lose money anytime somebody comes in thinking about getting chicken and instead gets steak for example. So we'd like to fix that. But if we decided, if there were some trends that we were little concerned about, we might decide to fix that a quarter or two later. But right now, unless things change, I think we're going to get this done by the third quarter. David Palmer : And then just a follow-up to your previous comments about the cycle, this three year ebb and flow that you seem to see. Looking back at the last slowdown, we came to see or at least we did, that there was perhaps some throughput constraints and then the throughput focus, and also that the marketing efforts that were breakthrough perhaps made a better case for this acceleration than you might have had otherwise. You're talking about a new campaign, but is there a little bit of an introspection, where you're seeing perhaps that whole campaign has perhaps lost its energy, and that's going to be a big part of your hope going forward. And then you're talking about this competition with throughput, is there a sense that perhaps some of the throughput metrics are perhaps not improving the way that they were? John Hartung : I think the throughput is improving very nicely, and we're really proud of what our teams are doing. Like I said, we think we can continue to go faster as the pressure of a busy second and third quarter comes to us. Over the last couple of years, even three years now sort of in a row, we've consistently set a new high watermark on throughput during our second and third quarters particularly each year. So we're getting faster and faster, and we think that we're not sort of close to being at the point where we can't get faster. That is to say, there is a long sort of a lot of runway on our ability to get faster. But I just want to sort of caution on the throughput thing, that you know throughput is something that's very important, when a lot of people come through our doors. It's always important, because it's part of good customer service. And it's always important, because when our throughput is fast, our food taste better, because our burritos are rolled and assembled and served to customers, while they're still hot. But throughput doesn't happen in a vacuum. When we have more pressure on our teams, longer lines, more customers, then it is a time when you're going to see our throughput numbers get better. That being said, throughput doesn't -- if we don't have people come through our doors, there is opportunities on throughput in some stores. If we're not going fast enough, we're not going to see as much of an ability to ramp up throughput. So great throughput over time will cause, I think, more customers to enjoy Chipotle, because they're going to trust that we can get them to more quickly, and that is more of a convenient experience. But great throughput doesn't sort of -- it will not add any comp in a vacuum during any given quarter. You have to have the transactions coming through your door. Mark Crumpacker : And with regard to your question regarding marketing, we have had a series of successful advertising campaigns, but I wouldn't look at it as if those campaigns or for example, I wouldn't look at it in a way to suggest that this current campaign can't achieve those same goals. If you look at what we're doing now -- in the past we've touted what we call our hero ingredients. We talked a lot about naturally raised or responsibly raised meats, local produce, pasteurized dairy, that kind of thing. But there are a number of other competitors who are trying to say similar things. The approach we're taking now is to expand that platform to include essentially what's not in our food. These 800 or so chemical additives, which are used to make processed food that is sold at most fast food, and the fact that Chipotle only have 65 ingredients in our entire, or 67 ingredients in our entire company, is really remarkable. So the new campaign is designed to prove that to people to show that to them in a very interesting compelling way. That will further differentiate Chipotle in a way that frankly the competitors can't mimic. I mean, you keep can't take all of this junk out of these other processed menu items in other fast food companies. They just can't do it. While they can mimic some of our past marketing, I think it would be very difficult for them to do this. So I expect this new approach to have potentially even greater impact than the ones previously. Operator : At this time, we'll move to Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Sara Senatore : I just have a couple of follow-up questions if I may. I guess, one is, I doesn't believe with the comp issue, but Jack, I guess the two-year trend actually or the three-year trend you're talking about, I don't know if you're adjusting for kind of the 1Q calendar shift in 2013, but the implication would be in fact negative. The process is certainly traffic. So I guess I'm just trying to reconcile some of the commentary. And the other piece I had about marketing is, so I think in the first half of last year, you had a pretty big increase in marketing dollars and it seems to have helped, along with your good initiatives that saw the lines really shorten through 2013. Is that something that you think about in terms of marketing spend is down between brand building and traffic driving? John Hartung : Sara, I'll take the comp issues first. When I look at the first quarter, you're right that in 2013, there was we lost a day. So that 1% comp is really like a 2% comp, so you can make that adjustment. There is also an adjustment to be made and I'm suggesting it's 100, 200 basis points in the first quarter and that's an estimate. It's our best estimate right now. And so the three year comp if you make those adjustments you're talking about something in 26%, 27% or so range. And if you do that and if you look out at the rest of the year, and listen, we do things like we adjust for trading day and things like that, I think the third quarter and the fourth quarter will be tough comparisons. I don't think the traffic will turn negative, but it will get close. So the margin for error is very, very small, but right now I wouldn't expect it to be a negative comp, but it's going to be close. So we're hoping for the best. Mark Crumpacker : And with regard the marketing spend, you need to be careful when looking at when the dollars are spent. We typically do the same type of marketing each year. That is to say, we do traditional advertising, outdoor print radio that sort of thing in the spring and the fall. That's what we did last year. And we're doing it at the same time this year. We're actually spending more than ever this year. You can see lumps in the spend because of how we developed the brand building content, like the short films or the television series, you can see that impact to marketing budgets in ways that make it look as if we're spending more at that moment when we're not. So I don't think there is a meaningful correlation between the spent of marketing and what we're seeing right now. What we're doing with marketing is pretty exactly what we did last year. Sara Senatore : And so one last thing, did I miss, did you give the mix for this quarter -- mix contribution? John Hartung : Yes, it was like 6.1% was menu price. That most of the rest of the transactions, it was a small piece, Sara, that wasn't transaction, but even that was greater group size than catering, which even now they're like transactions, because you're serving more people. There wasn't anything in terms of the people buying different items on a menu that caused the check to go up, so menu price is the biggest piece, 6.1%. Most of the rest of the transaction and a small piece related to group size and catering. Operator : It's all the time we have for questions. At this time, I'll turn things back over to Mark Alexee for closing remarks. End of Q&A Mark Alexee : Thank you again for joining our call today. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thanks. Operator : And again, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation.",

The quiet period begins on the first day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the third quarter, it will begin September 1 and continue through our Q3 earnings release planned for October 20, 2015. On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Monty Moran, Co-Chief Executive Officer; Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Crumpacker, Chief Creative and Development Officer. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve. Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer : Thanks Mark. I'm pleased with our performance during the second quarter and first half of 2015. On the heels of what was arguably our best year ever as a public company in 2014, we have continued to post strong results. During the quarter, we generated revenue of $1.2 billion, an increase of 14.1% on comparable restaurant sales growth of 4.3% and the opening of 48 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings of $4.45 per share, an increase of 27.1%. These results are particularly strong considering the very difficult comparisons we face and keep us on pace with the guidance we provided for 2015. The strength of our business is the result of our focus on our unique food and people cultures, and in an increasingly crowded and competitive industry, these unique and compelling attributes continue to differentiate Chipotle and drive our success. During the quarter, we took a significant step to improve the food we serve when we completed our transition to using only non-GMO ingredients to make all the food we serve in our restaurants. We began this effort two years ago when we made the decision to voluntarily disclose the GMOs in our ingredients. Following that move, we worked to eliminate the limited number of GMO ingredients we were using to make our food, which included soybean oil and some ingredients in our tortillas. Today, all of the food we serve at Chipotle restaurants is made with non-GMO ingredients. While that decision was made with some criticism, most of which was tied to the notion that GM foods do not present any health risks to people who consume them, the majority of the response to our decision was overwhelmingly positive, and we believe it was the right thing to do for a number of reasons. First, we believe that a few GMO ingredients that were on our menu were not making our food any better in any way; second, that there was considerable debate about long-term impacts associated with GMO farming systems; and third, that more research is necessary to fully understand the impacts of GMO foods, particularly studies that are long-term and independent in nature. Our position on GMOs very much aligns with consumer sentiment on this issue, and quite simply, Chipotle is the only national chain where consumers can eat anything on the menu without worry about eating GMOs. This direction is not new for us, and the decision is very consistent with our overall culture of serving food with integrity. There are a number of ingredients that have been declared safe to eat, including artificial flavorings and colorings for example, that are also not in our food. Simply because something is deemed safe doesn't mean that it's necessary or that it makes our food better in any way. With our food now made entirely from non-GMO ingredients, we have set our sights on making better tortillas. These artisanal tortillas are made using only five ingredients : flour, water, starter, vegetable oil, and salt. And when you consider that the starter, which is the leavening agent, is made from flour and water, it's really just four ingredients. While this might sound like a relatively simple undertaking, it's actually quite a challenge because one has to account for a number of variables : moisture in the flour, temperature and humidity in the bakery, strength of the starter, et cetera. And many of the chemical additives in commercial tortillas are designed to mitigate these variabilities. So, while our tortillas necessitate the keen eye and hand of our bakers, we know that skilled bakers can make better tasting tortillas, more similar to homemade tortillas than we currently get at commercial scale. Tortillas made commercially generally contain artificial additives, including preservatives to extend their shelf life and dough conditioners to give them strength and the ability to stretch in order to eliminate the need for natural fermentation process of the dough. The new tortillas we are working to develop through a partnership with Washington State University's Bread Lab would have no artificial ingredients, but rather will have only a few real whole ingredients that have traditionally been used to make tortillas. Returning to this fresher, simpler tortilla essentially requires that we reinvent the way tortillas are made on a large scale, and that's exactly what we're doing. While we're in the very early stages of this project, the tortillas that we're making are delicious and perform very well. Later this fall, we'll be scaling the project up for continued testing. This is consistent with our overall Food With Integrity mission, one that respects the environment, farmers, the bakers, our customers' health, and ultimately their taste buds. We have also made significant progress to resolve our pork shortage which began in January. As you'll likely recall, we suspended one of our primary pork suppliers when a routine audit found that the supplier was not adhering to all facets of our animal welfare protocol. We have found the new supplier, Karro Food Group of the UK, and have begun serving pork from Karro in most of our Florida restaurants, a little over 100 restaurants in total. While it has always been our preference to source meats domestically, the quantity of pork that meets our standards is simply not available right now from domestic suppliers as the vast majority of pork raised in the United States, more than 95% based on our estimates, is not raised to our standards. The pork we are getting from Karro Foods meets or exceeds all of our animal welfare standards including that this pork comes from pigs that are born on pasture and raised in deeply bedded barns. However, Karro adheres to a different antibiotic protocol. Under Karro's program, pigs can be given antibiotics under veterinary supervision and can remain in supply. What is important to note is that antibiotics cannot be used sub-therapeutically to promote growth at Karro. This program is common in the UK and has been endorsed by a number of animal welfare, scientific and veterinary organizations in the United States. During the coming months, we'll be sourcing more pork from Karro and returning carnitas to the restaurants around the country on a market-by-market basis until we're fully supplied again, which we expect to happen before the end of the year. We knew when we made the decision to suspend the pork supplier that it would leave us without enough pork for all of our restaurants and that our decision could impact customers' perceptions of Chipotle and have an impact on our sales. We're extremely pleased by the reaction from our customers, many of whom applauded us for taking this principled stand. As we continue to ramp up our pork supply, we expect to regain any lost sales tied to this outage. We're making these changes to improve our ingredients as we continue on our Food With Integrity journey. For more than 15 years, we've been working hard to change the way people think about and eat fast food. In recent months, a number of food companies have made pledges to remove some artificial ingredients from their food, primarily things like artificial colors and preservatives. This reality, however, is that these ingredients make up only a portion of the thousands of additives used in processed foods. Aside from our tortillas, none of our foods include any of these additives. With competitors making vague pledges, we're strengthening our marketing message to continue to show the contrast between what Chipotle has always done and the changes others are pledging. We've always and will continue to make our food with the very best ingredients we can find. And once our tortilla project is complete, we will not rely on any of the artificial ingredients that are so prevalent in processed foods. To highlight this differentiation, today we launched a new program called Friends or Faux, which is an integrated campaign that includes an interactive digital game that invites customers to learn about the difference between Chipotle's ingredients and those commonly used to make fast food and processed/packaged foods. To play the game, consumers choose a Chipotle menu item and a representative traditional fast food item, and they compare and match the ingredients, identifying which items contain which ingredients. The online game will include a limited-time BOGO promotion for participants, while encouraging customers to learn more about Food With Integrity mission. In addition to the game, the campaign is also supported by extensive online advertising, which begins today. Constantly working to improve the quality and taste of the food we serve is embedded in our culture and our track record to improve our food is unmatched in the industry. With the strength of our food culture and a unique and compelling people culture that further separates Chipotle from other restaurant companies, we believe we have the pieces in place to continue to change the way people think about and eat fast food and to deliver outstanding results for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Monty. Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director: Thank you, Steve. Our excellent results are possible because of the strength of our very special people culture. By hiring teams of top performers, empowering them to achieve high standards and developing them to be leaders for our company, we are providing a consistently extraordinary restaurant experience, while also running our restaurants in a way that helps us maintain a strong unique economic model. Having the best teams requires that we provide extraordinary opportunities for our people. The most unique benefit that we provide is the opportunity for our people to develop into the most effective leaders they can be with the most rewarding career possible, and this is at the core of our culture. But we also invest in benefits and compensation packages that match the talent of our teams. During the quarter, a number of up and coming leaders took advantage of new opportunities, as we promoted 39 managers into restaurateur positions and also promoted 16 new field leaders including nine apprentice team leaders, three team leaders, and two team directors. These promotions are what we've come to expect at Chipotle. Currently, more than 90% of our restaurant managers come from within the ranks of our crew and we've promoted 5,900 people who started as crew into management positions just this year, on top of the 10,500 people who started as crew and were promoted into management positions last year. With our strong ability to develop our leaders from within and the importance of establishing restaurateur cultures in all of our restaurants, our people culture continues to be a primary asset leading to our growth and also gives us great optimism that we will continue to experience strong growth going forward. The leaders we are developing are able to attract other talented people to our company and are deeply committed to having these new people reach their full potential. By hiring only top performing employees and developing them to be at their very best, we are able to do things that other restaurant companies simply can't do. Not only do our teams run extraordinary restaurants, preparing delicious food using classic cooking techniques and providing exceptional customer service, they also elevate the people around them. This approach to running our restaurants is what enables us to create such an outstanding dining experience and to deliver such strong unit economics. To help perpetuate our culture and the development of our top performers, we held a meeting during the quarter with field leaders, some of them new to the company and others with long careers here, to discuss and clarify the role of all field leaders at Chipotle. We were pleased at how committed our leaders are to the concept of achieving success by making others better. Our field leaders see more clearly now than ever that their success depends on the success of the people they lead. There's no ambiguity as to the priorities we have for our leaders at Chipotle. They know that their job is to develop restaurateurs and they have a very clear understanding as to how to do that. We've told our field leaders that we define their success by looking at three things : first, that each general manager that they lead must know exactly why they're not a restaurateur; second, each of their general managers must be able to clearly state exactly what their plan is to become a restaurateur and what their priorities are in order to do so; third, the general managers must be actually developing into restaurateurs. The most important tool field leaders have to help them succeed in this task is the Restaurateur diagnosis and plan tool. Using this tool allows our field leaders to uncover the positive and negative themes that may exist in each restaurant and to make a specific plan for how to best eliminate those negative themes. With the tool now well established, field leaders are using it as the basis for each visit to a restaurant, and with the proper progress updates, it is allowing our field leaders to chart the development path for restaurateur cultures, with each visit and each revision to the plan serving as a new chapter in the development story for the general manager. Of course all of these stories should have the same ending, another team establishing a restaurateur culture and adding to our group of elite leaders who are changing the way people think about and eat fast food. During the quarter, we took some important steps to strengthen our compensation and benefits programs, particularly at the crew level. We completed the first installment of our twice-annual merit increases for crew and made a one-time compensation adjustment for our kitchen managers and service managers to ensure compensation for those positions is consistent with the very high expectations that these roles carry. We also made improvements to the benefits we offer hourly crew by increasing paid vacation and adding paid sick days, and by expanding our tuition reimbursement program to include hourly employees in addition to the salary managers to whom this benefit was already available. One of the greatest benefits of having such strong cultures in our restaurants is that it enables us to deliver excellent customer service, which generates great throughput. Our teams understand the qualities that make for great throughput are the same qualities that provide the very best customer service, having everything ready in the restaurant before customers arrive so that we're prepared for service, particularly at our busiest times, as well as clear authentic communication with customers to keep our lines moving quickly without making people feel rushed. During the quarter, we held a national throughput competition to emphasize the importance of the four pillars in our restaurants. We achieved a number of new one-hour throughput records by reiterating the fundamentals of throughput and we continue to increase the number of restaurants that are implementing the four pillars during our peak dinner periods. As a result, we were able to largely maintain the substantial gains we made during 2014 to our throughput during our peak lunch and dinner hours. This is significant because last year was a tremendous year in which we delivered double-digit transaction comps that created the very tough comparison for this year. Our restaurateurs continue to find opportunities to improve our standards and increase throughput, and we know that we're in a stronger position today as we're better prepared to utilize the four pillars to provide a more favorable customer experience. Finally, on the development front, we are well on track throughout the first half of the year towards our guidance of opening 190 to 205 new restaurants. Actually the pace of openings during the first half of the year gives us confidence that we'll finish 2015 at or above the high end of our guidance range for the full year. During the second quarter, we opened 48 new restaurants. That's a total of 97 so far for the year, bringing our total number of restaurants to 1,878. After the end of the quarter, we also opened one new restaurant in London where Chipotle continues to build a strong customer base. With the first week of opening of our seventh restaurant in the UK, our team has already beat the existing UK throughput record with 229 transactions during its peak lunch hour, which is very encouraging. And finally, Canada's performance has been so successful that we no longer consider it to be a growth seed, but rather a growth strategy. This means we now view Canada as a proven market and will look to accelerate our pace of development in Canadian markets over the next year. We also just completed the second of our three Cultivate Festivals for the year as the most recent festival concluded in Kansas City last weekend. This year's event in Kansas City was a terrific success and consumers were able to try out Pizzeria Locale at the festival ahead of our new restaurant opening tomorrow in Kansas City. We continued to further develop our growth seeds with a Pizzeria Locale opening in Cincinnati and a new ShopHouse to open in Chicago. So heading into the third quarter, we're in a great position from a development perspective and we continue to have a very strong real estate pipeline. We're excited about our results for the quarter and for the first half of 2015. With a strong food culture, a unique and empowering people culture and the best unit economics in the industry, we are changing the way people think about and eat fast food and we're delivering outstanding results for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Jack. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Monty. We're proud of our performance through the first half of 2015 in which we continue to have positive comp sales on annual restaurant volumes that now average more than $2.5 million each. While our comparisons this year are the toughest we've faced as a public company, I'm confident that our top-performing teams will continue to attract more customers as they prepare and serve delicious food made from high quality, sustainably-raised ingredients. I've been very active since our last earnings call, visiting five of our eight regions and spending time with our field leadership and restaurant teams and promoting 17 new restaurateurs during that time, which gives me great confidence that we have a strong bench of up and coming future leaders to support our growth. Our sales increased 14.1% in the quarter to $1.2 billion driven by new restaurant openings and a sales comp of 4.3%, which is right in line with the Q2 guidance of low-to-mid single digits we provided in April. The comp was driven mainly by our price increase from last year, which contributed 4% to the comp. We've now fully lapped the price increase taken in the second quarter of 2014, so the 4% pricing benefit we enjoyed in Q2 is gone. Comp sales transaction counts in July so far remain in positive territory in the low-single digits. We're still without pork in about 40% of our restaurants today, but July sales are benefiting slightly by about 60 basis points from a targeted price increase on steak and barbacoa. As we discussed during prior earnings calls, we decided to take this targeted menu price increase in steak and barbacoa as beef pricing remains at historically high levels and our menu price gap between steak and barbacoa versus other entrees did not cover this higher cost. The average increase was just about 4% or about $0.30 per entree. We've not yet increased beef prices in about 40% of our restaurants, which have not been resupplied with carnitas. We held off in those markets because we want to avoid the unintended consequence of having customers trade from carnitas to steak or barbacoa and then be forced to pay more for their meal. Our intention is to raise beef prices in these markets once carnitas is back in supply. The price increase was effective earlier this month and while it's still early we have not seen any resistance so far. For the full year we continue to expect comps to be in the low to mid-single digits, including the targeted price increase on beef I just discussed. This assumes our comps will remain in the low-single digits for the rest of this year. As Steve mentioned, we recently added a new pork supplier and we hope to be back in full supply of carnitas in all markets by early in Q4. In April we estimated a pork shortage may have impacted our comp by as much as 200 basis points and we believe the net impact for Q2 was in line with this estimate. And while we're optimistic that bringing pork back to all markets will help our comp, we have not included any bounce back related to carnitas in our guidance. Restaurant level margins increased 70 basis points to 28%, among our highest margins as a public company, despite being a less than stellar quarter for our labor execution. The higher margins were driven by our lower food cost at 33.1% which were 150 basis points better than last year and 80 basis points better than the first quarter. The lower food costs are tied to our menu price increase from last year along with lower pricing for dairy and avocados as lower dairy was driven by continued strong production and a strengthening U.S. dollar, and the avocado supply has benefited from an increased harvest of Mexican avocados. Beef costs held relatively stable in the quarter, but remain substantially elevated from historical levels and added nearly 100 basis points to our food costs compared to last year. We hope our food costs can remain at about this level through the back half of the year, but we do expect some pressure from avocados as we purchased more from the California growers and perhaps also from beef, which has been difficult to predict and could remain volatile. Labor costs were 22.6% of sales during the quarter, an increase of 80 basis points compared to last year. While labor rates are increasing at a faster rate than they have in a very long time, which I'll talk about a little later, the majority of this higher labor relates to ineffective labor scheduling and execution. We were hampered during the quarter by an interruption in our labor management reporting as a result of implementing a new workforce enterprise system. Our investment in our operational systems are a long-term investment that will allow for more effective scheduling in the future but is not without some short-term hurdles that can be typical of these integration efforts. This has caused us to temporarily lose some oversight of our labor scheduling. We've now reestablished most of the management reporting now. And so far in July we recaptured about half of the opportunity or about 40 basis points and we expect to capture the rest of the opportunity during the third quarter. So the third quarter will still have somewhat elevated labor as we're recapturing the lost labor efficiency throughout this quarter, but we expect to be back to normal for all of Q4. We believe this labor challenge has negatively impacted EPS during the second quarter by about $0.16. While we're disappointed with our labor execution, our field teams are committed to bring our labor back in line quickly and they're going well beyond that to ensure that all of our restaurant managers and our field leaders become experts at writing and executing great schedules, so our labor deployment will be great with or without the availability of oversight reporting in the future. So I'm confident we will fully recapture this opportunity. Hourly labor rates including our hourly managers increased 4.2% in the quarter, the fastest we have seen in many years. There has been a general increase in wage rates in many of our markets and because we desire and expect to attract and reward only top performers, very important for us to stay ahead of the curve and pay attractive starting wages. We also continually monitor the pay of our top performers already in our restaurants as they progress through the manager ranks to ensure we're paying fair wages in light of their significant contributions and so this is also a contributing factor to the increase in the quarter. As Monty mentioned, we also enhanced the benefits off to our crew by adding a tuition reimbursement program and by paying for sick time and increasing the vacation pay. By far the greatest benefit we offer to our people is a significant opportunity to advance into leadership positions within Chipotle, but these enhancements represent important investments to ensure we are attracting, retaining, and elevating the very best people into these leadership positions. We know that our special people culture with the restauranteur as a centerpiece leads to a better dining experience for our customers, better tasting food, faster throughput, the development of extraordinary future leaders, better business results, and ultimately the creation of significant shareholder value. So it's important to note that improving our special people culture occurs through great leadership and having a restauranteur vision and cannot simply be bought by throwing additional dollars at our team, but a key component of our people culture is to attract and retain great people. So we make these investments knowing it will make our company stronger. We expect the incremental costs of these investments to be about $2.5 million incrementally on a quarterly basis beginning in the third quarter. We typically pay above minimum wage in all of our markets, so a normal increase in local wages usually has little effect on us. But in some local markets the minimum wage has been or soon will be pushed well above our national average rate. In the San Francisco Bay Area for example, the minimum wage was recently increased to over $12 an hour. This increase coupled with higher occupancy and other operating costs excluding food costs contribute to an overall cost of doing business of 30% or more compared to 30% or more higher than our average Chipotle. But our menu prices in the San Francisco area were until recently only about 4% above the typical Chipotle and were lower than most competitors in the area. So as a result of looking at all of these factors, we decided we were underpriced in San Francisco and we recently increased prices by 10% in the 10 restaurants within San Francisco and by 7% for the 74 restaurants outside San Francisco in the Bay Area. These relatively modest increases effectively pass along only some of the higher cost of doing business in that area. Because only 84 restaurants were affected, the impact on the overall company will be about 30 basis points on an annual basis. We'll take a similar approach when the overall costs of doing business in a market are escalating on a case-by-case basis, whether these higher costs are driven by legislative changes or by market forces. As an example, although the minimum wage in Maryland recently increased to over $10 an hour, our overall cost of doing business are reasonable there. And so we do not plan to increase our pricing in those restaurants. Our objective will always be to keep our menu accessible to our customers while being able to recruit the best people we can with competitive wages in each market and also while considering the overall cost of doing business and competitive prices in the area. Occupancy cost for the quarter were 5.4% of sales, flat compared to last year. Other operating costs were 10.9% during the quarter, down 10 basis points from 2014. Marketing was 1.8% during the quarter, slightly lower than the second quarter of last year, and we continue to expect our marketing expense to be around 1.7% of sales overall for the year. G&A was 5.9% in the quarter, down 120 basis points from the prior year due to lower non-cash stock comp expense. Full year non-cash stock comp is expected to be slightly below the $80 million we previously forecasted. And this expense will be more evenly weighted throughout the year. Our effective tax rate during the quarter was 38.8% and we estimate our effective tax rate for the full year will be about 38.7% and that compares to 37.6% for the full year 2014. Last year benefited from an increase in the estimated useable state credits and from the work opportunity and R&D federal tax credits which have not been renewed for 2015. If those federal credits are extended to 2015, we estimate our tax rate would benefit by about 30 basis points. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $4.45, an increase of 27.1%. We finished the second quarter with nearly $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, including short-term and long-term interest bearing investments and no debt on our balance sheet. Since our last earnings call on April 21 and through yesterday, we invested more than $100 million to repurchase nearly 164,000 shares of our stock at an average share price of $621. This is more than four times the dollar amount invested during the first quarter and nearly five times the number of shares purchased during Q1 when the average purchase price was $675. And this is a good example of what we mean by being opportunistic with the timing and the magnitude of our share buybacks. While we continue to believe investing in our high-returning restaurants remains the best use of our cash, we'll also continue to invest opportunistically in repurchasing our stock. And today we announced that our board has authorized the investment of an additional $100 million to repurchase our stock, which brings our current unused authorization as of yesterday to $170 million. Thanks for your time today, and we'll be happy to open the lines for any questions. Operator : And we'll go first to David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Jack, I just wanted to follow up on some of the commentary about recent sales trends. I think you said July had stayed positive on comps. Could you confirm that that also implies that traffic is trending positively or at least flat so far this quarter? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Yes, David, both sales and transactions are positive in July. They're in the low-single digits, but they're both positive. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you. And then my other question is around the carnitas issue, and I was just wondering if you could share what you've learned so far about the customer reaction to that in terms of the traffic trends. And then I think you've brought that back in at least one market recently, Manhattan. So could you talk about how long it takes for customers to respond to that coming back and your confidence level that you'll be able to win that business back when you get the full chain rolled out on pork? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Yes, David, it's really early to know what the exact response is going to be based on this new supply that Steve talked about from Karro in the UK. But when we saw other markets, you remember since January when we first ran out, we had this rolling blackout. So every several weeks we would have one market run out of carnitas, and then we would replenish the supply in another market. And what you saw, that it took several weeks to get the full product mix back. And I would say that's anywhere between three weeks at the low side up to five or six weeks on the high side. So we're optimistic that we'll start to see some of that recovery as we continue to roll markets, but we're going to roll markets with this new supply of carnitas from now throughout the summer and then into early in the fourth quarter. And so hopefully what we'll see market by market is that the product mix will recover over several weeks and that we'll start to see sales comps recover as well. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And we'll now go to our next question from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Thank you very much. I had a couple of questions actually, more about on the mobile side. I know you've been making some investments there. I was wondering if you could talk about that. Is the progress a potential comp driver, and related to that, maybe anything you've done on loyalty. It occurs to me that that's probably a rich source of data on your customers. And particularly now when the carnitas has been in shortage, you could communicate with customers directly and you would know who is or who isn't buying carnitas at your stores. It just feels like an untapped data pool that maybe you could use. So just an update on mobile, Apple Pay, loyalty, that whole kind of ecosystem, please. Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative and Development Officer : Sure, Sara. This is Mark Crumpacker talking. Yes, in fact we've been investing in mobile on an ongoing basis for quite a while. We're still in the process of evaluating the level of effort that's going to be required to implement Apple Pay in particular. And we certainly see that as being a significant benefit to us once we can get that enabled, especially if it in any way speeds throughput at our restaurants. But we're also on a continuing basis updating our mobile ordering app to be more efficient. In fact, we did an update just a couple of months ago and we have another one coming up which make the ordering more accurate, which we're looking at having a significant impact. And one thing I'll direct you to that's not necessarily related to mobile that is also our efforts around catering, which currently cannot be ordered online, nor can it be paid for online. That's another initiative that we're working on which we expect will have an impact. With regard to loyalty, that's a tricky subject. We've studied this in-depth, and we don't believe the general supposition that loyalty will make less frequent customers more frequent. We've studied that and just simply don't believe that to be true. However, what you said is true, in that you learn a tremendous amount of information about your customers. And so we're planning on doing that, but not through a traditional loyalty program but rather through mobile payment. So we will provide our customers at some time various options through which they can pay for their food and we will capture data from them, whether that's through a third party or through the ability to use our own gift cards. And that will give us a tremendous amount of data about those customers. So, I can't tell you right now when those things are going to be complete, but we're investigating and pursuing all of them. Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : And we'll now take a question from David Palmer with RBC. David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Just building on that, I just did that Friend or Faux quiz online, which I guess was kicked off today or recently, and at the end it included a BOGO coupon which could be texted to me and then it also signed me up to get text updates four times a month. What will be the nature of those texts that we'll be getting? Are those going to be also value-oriented deals? Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative and Development Officer : Well, I mean, we've actually had a text database of a number of our customers for quite a long time, and we send them a variety of different communications. They sometimes are promotion based and it really depends obviously on what we're trying to accomplish. Other times we'll send them information about upcoming events like our Cultivate events, if it's in their city. For most of our text database subscribers, we know where they are, so we can localize those messages. But we are constantly trying to expand our mobile database. It's a very effective way for us to efficiently reach our customers. In fact, the Friend or Faux game that you mentioned, just since it launched today, more than 0.5 million people have already played the game. So it's really got extraordinary power. So, yes, there will be offers in those, but certainly not every one of the communications will be an offer. David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Thanks. Good afternoon. I just wanted to better understand what comps you need to offset inflation. I hate to call or ask in a \"normal\" environment, but can you help us gauge the second half store level margin in what is presumably a low-single digit comp environment, given that in Q2 you still did concentrate (36:51) leverage on store level margin? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Yes, Nicole, food cost will not change based on our comps. So food costs will either change or remain stable just based on commodity pricing, the pricing of the ingredients that we buy. And as I mentioned in my comments, we're hoping that those will remain stable and stay at about the level we just saw in the second quarter. So the rest of the P&L has some variable and some fixed costs in there. From a labor standpoint, we typically need kind of a mid-single digit comp in order to just hold our labor as a percentage of sales, so it's somewhere in that 4% to 6% range. So low-single digit comps would imply that we're going to delever on the labor line. The rest of the P&L, a low-single digit comp, it depends on whether it's a 1% or a 3%. If it's in the 2% or 3% range, unless there is something unusual with energy costs or something unusual which would affect utilities, we should be okay. We should be able to about hold the rest of the costs on our P&L as a percentage of sales. So it really comes down to labor. Now keep in mind we did announce all these benefits. And so regardless of the comp, we are going to see an incremental $2.5 million added to both the third quarter and fourth quarter, and that will continue as an additional cost of providing the benefits. And so that will cause some slight delevering as well. Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Nicole. Operator : Our next question will come from Jason West with Credit Suisse. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yes, thanks. Just wanted to come back to the pricing outlook. Jack, you talked about a couple different pieces with San Francisco and then some of the beef cost pressures. But then some of that's going to get delayed as you wait for carnitas to roll out. So could you help us out with maybe what the aggregate price increase is going to look like over the next few quarters with these different timing issues? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Yes, as we roll carnitas, there's about 40% of our restaurants don't have carnitas today. And so that's going to be a price increase that will be in the ballpark of this 4%. And our beef, our steak and barbacoa is somewhere in the 30% range in terms of product mix. So we're right now running about 60 basis points of incremental comp because of raising prices on beef. When we roll the rest of the 40% that will get us somewhere in the 100, 110 basis points or something like that. And then any other things that we do related to local cost of doing business, I would expect to be relatively modest. The example I gave you was San Francisco and the Bay Area. That adds an additional 30 basis points. There's not much else going on really between now and the end of the year. So I would say we're going to be between the \u2013 if you take the 60 basis points on the higher cost of steak and barbacoa, add the 30 basis points from San Francisco, that's 90 basis points. There might be another 30 basis points or 40 basis points or so that will roll in over the next several months. And that would be about it for this year. There are some additional structural costs, higher costs of doing business that we will look at next year like we did in San Francisco. But just because minimum wage is increasing in a market doesn't mean we're going to raise prices. The example that I gave in Maryland is a great example. Another one is in Chicago. Chicago just recently implemented higher minimum wage, and we don't expect to raise prices there in the near future, probably not at all this year. And so we'll look at it market by market and there might be some cases where when you look at all of our higher cost of doing business that we might deem that it's necessary to take a price increase in those markets. But I wouldn't expect that to be a significant add-on to our comp or a significant add-on to the menu price increases. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks. That's really helpful, by the way. On the labor side, the incremental $2.5 million per quarter, is that inclusive of some of the wage inflation that you're talking about that stepped up lately, and I think you've raised wages for certain positions, or is that separate from the wage inflation that we're seeing? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : It's inclusive of the stuff that Monty talked about where we looked at our kitchen managers and service managers, where we took a look at all of our folks that are already on board. Some of that hit in the second quarter and then incrementally adding $2.5 million onto the third and fourth quarter will cover all of that. What it doesn't necessarily include is if there is just general market forces. In a market where wages are increasing faster than expected, that isn't necessarily included in that, and that would be dealt with case by case. But the $2.5 million will consider all of the adjustments that we've done from a benefit standpoint and from a wage standpoint to all of our internal folks. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, Jack. Just want to follow up on the San Francisco example. I mean, what has the consumer reaction told you in San Francisco so far about the ability to take that kind of targeted price increase, if it makes sense given the pressures in the market? And then secondarily, on the pork from England, is that a similar margin profile to what you get in the U.S.? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Okay. So on San Francisco, Sharon, I was just out in San Francisco a few weeks ago, visited a bunch of our restaurants, talked to our teams there, talked to some customers as well. No reaction whatsoever from what I can tell. We don't see it in any of the sales trends. We don't see it with any of the anecdotal feedback we're getting. Frankly, I think we've got lots more room to increase prices if we need to. The costs of doing business are so extraordinary in that whole market that I think we're underpriced, and we could increase prices more. As you know, we've never wanted to be too aggressive at any one time, but there's more room to do that. And so if the cost of business continue to remain elevated or if they increase further, we've got more room. I wouldn't expect us to do anything inside of 12 months. I don't think we would do two within a year, but I think we've got lots more room. And then the margin on pork very similar to our margin for the domestic pork. Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Sharon. Operator : And we'll go next to Karen Short from Deutsche Bank. Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Just a question to follow up on the loyalty philosophy. I guess I don't know that I necessarily understand your philosophy on being reluctant or unwilling to introduce some form of loyalty or affinity program, because I guess the way I see it is you incur costs associated with the BOGOs or the Friend or Faux free burritos and things like that, so you could recoup costs if you are introducing some kind of affinity program that does involve some free giveaways, but then you get the benefit of having that much more robust data and analytics, I guess. So maybe just some color there. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : I'll take a shot at part of this and then I think Mark will want to add something in. Karen, we have done a very thorough analysis of kind of the traditional loyalty programs and the problem is Chipotle already has so many loyal customers that the fixed costs of implementing an ongoing loyalty program were so extraordinary that you had to get a pretty big incremental comp just to cover those costs and then you had to get a comp on top of that and then maintain it for it to be profitable at all. What we've found is we've been able to build loyalty through more organic methods by encouraging people to learn more about Chipotle, by piquing their interest about how food is raised, by having them come into Chipotle and be treated to an extraordinary dining experience. And so we've seen our loyalty go up over the years, and we think that's a better way to do it than putting in a structural framework that we didn't think was going to be profitable at all and or maybe it would be a breakeven or you'd have to go to an (45:27) extraordinary comp to make it pay off. Now having said that, the customer data is valuable, and so, I don't know, Mark, if you wanted to make a comment about that. We definitely treasure that information. Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative and Development Officer : Yeah, with regard to our traditional loyalty program, in the past the thinking there is that if you can take an infrequent or lapsed customer and make them come to your restaurant just one more time, you would pay for the program. Our research has indicated that there are virtually no loyalty programs that actually achieve that. What they do is they reward your most loyal customers, and so we figured out other ways to do that. You know, we have ongoing ways to give our most valuable customers ways to interact with Chipotle where they learn a little bit more and we give them some free food in exchange. But on the data side, you're absolutely right. That's what we want and we believe that we can achieve perhaps not the same level of granularity in the information, but enough information through a payment system that will give us what we want essentially without the downsides that's sort of the ongoing way of the loyalty program. So it's not quite as much data that you get in a loyalty program, but it's enough the way we envision it that it will do the trick. Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative and Development Officer : Sure. Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer : Thanks Karen. Operator : Thank you. And we'll now go to John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Just first a detailed question. Jack, can you just be explicit about the traffic and the mix in the second quarter? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, so they're very small numbers, John. You know, the comp was 4.3%, menu pricing was 4%. Of the 0.3%, it was a very slight negative traffic, 0.3% negative traffic, and that was offset by 60 basis points or 70 basis points of mix. And the mix improvement was generated a little bit by catering, a little bit by sides, and a little bit by kid's meals. We reformatted the kid's meals and we're now serving a few more of them and the pricing structure happens to be a little bit higher, especially the ones that our customers are choosing. They're choosing to build your own more frequently and that's a little bit more expensive, so those are the pieces, but they're all very, very small numbers. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's helpful. The bigger question is on the newer concepts; if I recall correctly the history of Chipotle, you got a real first mover advantage in many markets by entering before your key competitors, and when you did so, you did better and when you were second you did less well. Maybe eventually did better, but maybe initially not as well. When you look at the newer concepts in particularly pizza, you're now badly lagging behind several chains that are in that category. Why isn't that incentive to be more urgency to develop faster? Is there other concerns you have about the concept and you're not ready to do that? Do you think it's going to be different for pizza than it was perhaps for your core concept, or is this first mover advantage maybe an overblown advantage? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Well, it's interesting. You know, we used to pay a lot of attention to the first mover advantage theory. When we were partnered with McDonald's, they were telling us how important it was in their development. Although, if you look at our history and our sales trends when we come into markets and we're not the first mover, we definitely pass them, I mean, California is the best example where we had two big competitors, and we severely lagged behind them. Over time though, through great execution and through a great people culture and sharing with our customers what makes Chipotle food special, we quickly took the lead. I think the best, the most important thing we can do is to have concepts that really resonate with customers. And we have spent a lot of time refining the Pizzeria Locale concept. We've gone through a couple of iterations of dough, and we think we have perfected it now. It's really excellent, and that's been in the restaurants now for a couple of months. And we feel confident that as we start with this dough in two new markets, in Kansas City and in Cincinnati, Kansas City just in a couple of days on Wednesday, actually tomorrow, and then Cincinnati in the fall, that we're going to prove to customers that our pizza, our dough, our method of this new way to serve pizza is superior to the competition out there. How long it takes to lap their sales volumes? I don't know. But if history is any indication, sticking to the things that really matter, like putting teams of top performers who are really empowered to achieve extraordinary things and giving them leadership opportunities sets the foundation, so they can deliver an excellent dining experience. And that's exactly what we're doing. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : We'll now go to Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. I have two questions. First is on just the cash. It looks like you have almost $600 million on the balance sheet today, and you're on track to do over $500 million in free cash flow. And I definitely appreciate the share repurchases that you've done and announced, but with that much cash, why not be more aggressive with repurchases rather than be opportunistic? And why not do that rather than have it sit on the balance sheet? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Well, Brian, I think the answer is that we do want to buy our stock back, but we don't want to just buy it back at any price at any time. We're much happier and we think it's a better boost to shareholder value to be patient. Our stock has always been volatile. It's always had run-ups. It's always had corrections. And we think the best thing to do is buy in the corrections. And I think the example that we just shared, where over the last three months when the stock had corrected for a period of time, we bought $100 million worth. So it's many multiple times what we bought in the first quarter. Now, had we just decided to buy $100 million in the first quarter, it would have just not gone as far. And so we think it's a better way to do it. We will get more aggressive as the price does drop. We do have more cash than we need. We know that the best way to add to shareholder value is to ready these growth seeds to be promoted to growth strategies, just like Canada was. We know that as we open up more Chipotles, we're opening the Chipotles at extraordinary returns and on cash returns in the 70% to 80% range. We know that's the best way to capture shareholder value. With the cash that we have, we'll buy back, but I think we'll continue to buy opportunistically. And we think that's a better way to build shareholder value over time. Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And my second question is on the comps, again. You've clearly seen an acceleration in traffic. Obviously on a one-year but even on a two-year basis, it appears as though you've seen an acceleration in traffic. When you look at things internally, which you can do and we can't, what do you think has really driven that improvement in the trends? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Well, if you're looking at \u2013 the trends that I would encourage you to look at are a three-year trend. And I talked about this on the last call, so I won't go into it again. But this current trend that we're in is kind of the third year of a three-year trend that started in 2013. If you look at the three-year trends, the three-year stack for the second quarter is more than 200 basis points better than the three-year stack for the first quarter. I think that that's more weather driven. So I would say right now we're not necessarily seeing an acceleration other than in respect to the worse weather in the first quarter. We still think we're being hampered by not having carnitas and we think that could be as much as a couple hundred basis points. And so we look at it as more the year is unfolding the way we thought it was. We thought that we would do 4% in the quarter. Our guidance was exactly that. We were predicting internally about 4% during the second quarter, and that's what it's doing. We'd also predicted that in the third quarter, while it's early, that we would be in the low single-digits, that it wouldn't be negative, that it would be close. And so things are, I would say, more playing out as we expect. Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Brian. Operator : We'll now go to Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Actually, just following up on that question with regard to the three-year trends, which I know you gave us a lot of color last quarter, I know the idea being the goal to reaccelerate those trends, presumably going into 2016 perhaps and maybe start a new cycle. I'm just wondering if you're any closer to considering or how you would prioritize the opportunity, whether it's \u2013 I know there's talk about a new protein like chorizo or a new daypart like breakfast or a greater push on catering. I'm just wondering how you prioritize those different opportunities to maybe just set the next path for a re-acceleration in the comp? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : So, Jeff, most of our focus and the vast majority of our attention is to have the best teams we can, developing the best leaders in the restaurants, hiring and developing top performers in every restaurant, because we know that there's a dramatic difference between experience, the quality of food, taste of the food, just the throughput, the business controls, everything when we have great leaders, restauranteur leaders that have all top performers, where there's a culture of empowerment, and these teams can deliver high standards in every single way. And so that's still and always will be the vast majority of where our attention goes. We are testing chorizo in a market right now in Kansas City. It's early, we've only had it in market for several weeks right now. We just this week, Mark, I think started advertising. If that's something that looks like it's either attracting new customers, or it's encouraging existing customers to visit more often, that might move up in the priority list. If all chorizo does is take our existing customers and split them among additional menu items, that will be less appealing to us because that just means we have more menu items serving the same customers and that makes it more complicated and more difficult to serve all this delicious food. So I come back to, in terms of priority, the difference between a great running restauranteur restaurant with an amazing team, compared to one that has a lot of themes that \u2013 Monty talked about the DPT \u2013 a restaurant that has a lot of themes, and they have some low performers on the team and empowerment is not great, the difference in the quality and taste of the food, the difference in how clean that restaurant is, just the difference in when you walk in, you feel like you're welcomed by a team of people that know you and are glad you're there, the difference when you compare that experience to a restaurant that doesn't have all top performers, and doesn't have the culture of empowerment is dramatic. And we believe that that's the single biggest thing we can do to build our sales over time. The other thing with marketing is we still believe that \u2013 or we still know that there's lots of people that have never been to Chipotle, something like 35% or 40% of people have never been to Chipotle. We know that when we study our existing customers, that there is like 55% of our customers only come a couple times a year. And so the more we can educate and entertain and things like this, this BOGO where if we can entice customers that don't come very often, once or twice a year, to learn more about our ingredients versus competitors, traditional fast food, and get a BOGO to entice them to come in, and that caused them to say, oh my God, I mean I haven't been in six months, this food is delicious, and I didn't know all this information about the ingredients. If we can convert that person into coming three times a year or four times a year, we think that's a big opportunity as well. So the vast majority of our attention goes on doing what we do, but do it better than ever. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understood. Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : And we'll now take a question from Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Andrew M. Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Just curious what you're attributing the traffic bounce back to? I mean obviously during the quarter it was slightly negative, but you just picked up so far in July. What do you think is driving that? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Other than comparisons, it's really hard to tell. Because it feels like we're still at a disadvantage by not having pork. So it still feels like we're being held back a bit. But I can't point to any specific reasons why we were slightly negative in the second quarter compared to so far in July. We're happy with the results, but there's nothing specific I can point to. Andrew M. Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And, Monty, just I know traffic obviously was a little bit of an issue, but did you see any improvement or any work or anything to call out on the throughput initiatives this quarter in terms of how many incremental customers you got through the line? Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director: In terms of incremental what? Andrew M. Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC: In terms of incremental customers you got through the line. Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director: The improvements we saw in this quarter were spotty throughout the country as certain teams responded really, really well to our throughput contest. But company-wide and overall, like I said in my opening comments, basically I think we were glad to hang on to the significant gains we made during 2014 when we had very significant increases in throughput. But we didn't see an increase in overall throughput company-wide during the quarter, which it's always disappointing not to see that. But I think like Jack said, with even slightly negative comps what happens I think with our teams is, it's more difficult for them to break throughput records and it becomes a little less top of mind for them as they start to focus on other aspects of the business waiting for that traffic to increase. So it certainly is a lot more fun to go out and set throughput records when they're shattering them on a daily basis, and when there is a slight falloff in traffic even if it's just a flattening of traffic even for a short time, I think that sometimes our eye is not on the ball to the degree it could be. So we do see improvements in a lot of our four pillars execution which is great. We see some really good 15-minute transaction numbers and records in areas. But overall, I think that I would be eager to see our teams push harder on the throughput such as to deliver even incremental increases in the third quarter. So we'll keep working on that. Andrew M. Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director: Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Alexee, at this time I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Mark Alexee - Manager, Investor Relations : Great. Thanks for participating in the call today. We appreciate your time. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

All participants are now in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to introduce Investor Relations Manager for Chipotle Mexican Grill, Mr. Mark Alexee. You may begin your conference. Mark Alexee - Manager, Investor Relations : Thank you. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the third quarter 2015, it may also be found on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements about potential business improvements, and shareholder returns, projections of the number of restaurants we intend to open and trends and development costs and new restaurant returns, estimates of future comparable restaurant sales increases or comps, and supply chain and other trends affecting future comps, projections regarding food, labor, marketing, occupancy and G&A costs, and our expected effective tax rate, statements about stock repurchases as well as other statements of our expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today and we are not assuming any obligation to update them. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as updated on our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of these risks. I'd like to remind everyone that we have adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period begins on the first day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the fourth quarter, it will begin December 1 and continue through our fourth quarter and year-end earnings release planned for late January 2016. On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Monty Moran, Co-Chief Executive Officer; Mark Crumpacker, Chief Creative and Development Officer and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve. Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Mark. I'm pleased with our performance during the third quarter and throughout the full year. With very difficult comparisons against the record year we had in 2014, we have continued to grow our business in a competitive environment while maintaining some of the best margins in the industry. During the quarter, we generated revenue of $1.2 billion, an increase of 12%, on comparable restaurant sales growth of 2.6% and the opening of 53 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings of $4.59 per share, an increase of 11%. With year-to-date revenue of $3.5 billion, comp sales growth of 5.5%, and earnings per share growth of 26%, we are well on track to deliver another strong year. More than that, I am proud of the fact that we continued to deliver such strong results by maintaining true to our vision to change the way people think about any fast food. We're realizing this vision through constant attention to our unique food and people cultures and by innovating to improve upon these key drivers of our business even in the face of challenges. During the quarter, we made significant strides to overcome a major obstacle tied to our ability to obtain pork that meets all of our animal welfare standards. Earlier this month, we announced that we have returned carnitas to 90% of our restaurants nationwide. As discussed on the last earnings call, we have begun to source pork from Karro Foods in the UK. It is raised in a way that meets or exceeds all of our animal welfare standards. Just like our current protocols, Karro does not use antibiotics non-therapeutically to promote growth in healthy animals. Karro follows European standards that allows antibiotics to be administered under veterinary supervision when necessary. We have been very happy with the quality of the pork they've been providing and the care and respect with which Karro is treating their animals. Since beginning our relationship with Karro, we have also secured an additional pork supplier and we expect to have enough pork to return carnitas to all of our restaurants by the end of November. We know that many of our customers love our carnitas, and we are disappointed we had to stop serving it in a number of our restaurants around the country. To all of our customers who have been inconvenienced by our carnitas shortage, I'd like to personally thank you for your patience and your support. We knew this issue would be difficult for our customers and our restaurants, but we also knew that suspending sales of carnitas in some of our restaurants rather than serving commodity pork was the right thing to do. And we are thrilled to see that so many of our loyal customers agreed with our decision. After highlighting this issue, we have begun discussions with a number of additional suppliers across the country that are interested in working with us to improve animal welfare conditions and meet the standards we require for our pork. I am so excited about this encouraging change, particularly when compared to the reaction we received when starting our Food With Integrity program a little more than 15 years ago. At that time, there was very little pork available that met our requirements. But today, some of the largest agricultural producers are taking a much closer look at the way they raise their animals, and they're starting to see that we have what we have always believed, that food grown and raised with respect for animals, the environment, farmers and customers simply taste better. We are excited to be close to returning to carnitas to 100% of our restaurants. And to let our customers know that carnitas is back, we have been promoting its return in our restaurants through social media and with PR, so customers who have been awaiting this return know where it is available. Of course, changing the way people think about and eat fast food requires more than overcoming supply chain challenges. We focus a lot of our marketing effort on educating customers through entertaining and creative approaches, which Mark will talk about a little bit later. And we're delighted that we continue to see evidence of Chipotle's impact on food issues. Most recently, the state of California passed SB 27, making it the first state in the country to pass legislation to limit antibiotic use in healthy livestock and to ban the routine use of antibiotics to promote growth. We began serving meat from animals raised without the use of antibiotics in 1999 when we started serving pork from Niman Ranch. Today, we serve more meat from animals raised without antibiotics than any other restaurant company. While we have been encouraged by even small steps made by other restaurant companies to reduce antibiotic use in farming and moves from some of the largest meat producers to embrace antibiotic-free practices or reduce antibiotic protocols. The California bill is important as it is the first to mandate more responsible antibiotic use in livestock. This is an important step forward in the evolution of animal agriculture, and we hope that others will take similar steps in the foreseeable future. During the quarter, we opened our seventh restaurant in London, a small five-day-per-week location in the financial district, which is intensely lunch-driven, like our first stores inside the Loop in Chicago. It is off to a solid start and has been breaking peak hour throughput records in the UK. Additionally, just last week, we opened our fourth restaurant in Paris, entering a new neighborhood for us. Our growth seeds in Europe continue to build brand recognition and are at the frontend of developing a loyal customer base. Our growth seeds here in the U.S. continue to show promise, and we have continued to expand ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale. ShopHouse recently opened its fourth location in Los Angeles, bringing the total number of ShopHouse restaurants to 11. And we plan to open two ShopHouse restaurants in Chicago before yearend. Pizzeria Locale expanded to its second market during the most recent quarter, opening its first restaurant in Kansas City and we plan to open two Pizzerias in Cincinnati in the coming months, very exciting to apply our strong food culture and our unique and empowering people culture to these growth seeds. We are changing the way people think about and eat fast food and our commitment to that vision is the best way to deliver outstanding results for our shareholders. Last, we recently hired our first-ever Chief Information Officer. Curt Garner will be joining Chipotle on November 23 and comes from Starbucks where he held the same position. In his 18 years at Starbucks, Curt helped build the technology infrastructure that began with fewer than 2,000 stores to one that now supports a global business. We believe that Curt's background and expertise will be a great asset to Chipotle as we continue to seek ways to accelerate our use of technology to help strengthen our business. We are very excited for Curt to join us and look forward to the value he will bring to Chipotle. I will now turn the call over to Monty. Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director: Thank you, Steve. Our excellent results are possible because of the strength of our special people culture. By hiring teams of top performers, empowering them to achieve high standards and developing them to be leaders for our company, we're setting ourselves up to be able to provide a consistently extraordinary restaurant experience, while also maintaining a strong unit economic model. Like our food culture, building the right people culture is an ongoing journey and is one that requires us to constantly push ourselves to find ways to get better and to raise the bar on the quality of the experience we provide. During the quarter, we hosted our biennial field leadership conference to bring together all of our field leaders and support departments to talk about how we can strengthen our culture. It was a wonderful and inspirational two days focused on how our field leaders can make a bigger impact in their restaurants and help our teams on the road to Restaurateur. We discussed the importance of instilling an inspiring vision, creating encouraging circumstances, and how to best utilize our diagnosis and plan tools to identify negative themes that are standing in the way of a restaurant achieving Restaurateur status. Our unique people culture also continues to gain traction within our growth seeds. As Steve mentioned, during the third quarter, we opened our seventh restaurant in London and I recently visited the fantastic team there and was pleased to be able to sign them off as Restaurateur. Our European operations team, which is led by Jacob Sumner, a team leader and Restaurateur, has been building outstanding teams to ensure the customer experience we are providing in these new markets meets our high standards and he continues to develop Restaurateur cultures in these restaurants quickly. To help us better plan for future growth, we recently hired Jerome Tafani as our Head of European Business Development. Jerome has decades of restaurant industry experience in Europe and is spearheading our planning process, including navigating the nuances of operating a new restaurant brand across several countries and identifying lower-cost real state options in markets that are very expensive. As European customers continue to discover and turn into repeat customers at Chipotle, we are excited for the leadership and insight that Jacob and Jerome bring and we look forward to great things to come from this team. As of the end of the quarter, we are proud to have a strong roster of nearly 500 Restaurateurs with an additional 30 restaurants ready to be signed off by an officer. Our past investment in field leadership is beginning to bear fruit and we're confident those improved restaurant cultures will lead to better service and a more compelling experience for our customers. Beyond our efforts to strengthen our restaurant leadership, we recently took a very visible step towards bolstering the bench strength in our restaurants as we held our first-ever National Career Day in September. We set ambitious goals to interview more than 30,000 candidates for this, and through the event and surrounding publicity, we ended up hiring 4,977 incremental crew members. Not only are we excited about our new hires, but this event also created a significant opportunity for us to showcase our people culture and the unique career opportunities we provide. Although, the overall labor market continues to show signs of tightening, we have found that top performers are consistently attracted to the challenging work environment and growth potential offered at Chipotle. One of the leadership roles within our restaurants is the reliance on what we refer to as a take-out specialist, whose job it is to take care of our out-of-store orders, which are a growing part of our business. As you may know, virtually every one of our restaurants is equipped with a second make line, which is an abbreviated version of the front line where we serve our regular customers. Fortunately, those second make lines are gradually getting more used and we're now averaging nearly $500 a day in sales per restaurant on the second make-line company-wide. In some of our high-volume restaurants, the sales in the second make line are much, much higher; such that it is virtually a second restaurant within the restaurant, which is a phenomenal way for us to leverage our existing kitchens. When we receive online fax or catering orders, the take-out specialist is managing the timing of orders, food production, and all other aspects of the guest experience and preparing the orders to be picked up. Not only is the sales channel exciting, but it offers the additional benefit of improving throughput as the more people who use the second make line, the better the customer experience is for the rest of our customers who can more quickly receive and enjoy their meal. During the third quarter, our teams increased throughput during our peak dinner hour by one transaction while non-peak throughput counts increased by nine transactions. Unfortunately, we declined by one transaction during our peak lunch hour and our teams will be working on instilling a sense of urgency to continue to improve this important aspect of customer service during the peak lunch hour. We know that as our volumes continue to grow, our teams need to continue to achieve incremental throughput gains to improve the overall customer experience. Better throughput is one key driver that helps us improve our unit economic model and over the years has contributed to some of our best cash-on-cash returns. Another component for a terrific return on investment is the great job that our development team has done in identifying locations for new restaurants while maintaining reasonable capital investment costs. We've built a fantastic development program as our real estate, design, and construction teams are finding favorable new restaurant sites and negotiating some of our best lease terms. During the quarter, we opened up 53 new restaurants for a total of 150 restaurants through the first nine months of this year. This is the fastest that we've ever added new stores and we're not done yet. Our teams have been working diligently and we are increasing our guidance for the full year 2015 to a range of 215 to 225 new Chipotles. What's even more encouraging is that we're able to complete these restaurants in what is arguably one of the most competitive real estate markets we've seen in recent years. Our teams have given us feedback that the competition for new site locations remains high and the demand for talented contractors, subcontractors, and crews is intense as many developers are taking advantage of the current low interest rate environment. Despite these pressures, we continue to focus on identifying an optimal mix of endcap and inline restaurants that have actually allowed us to lower our average investment cost. Also, Chipotle remains a preferred tenant for many landlords, and that places us in a strong position to negotiate favorable lease and tenant improvement terms. It also helps us get into properties even where demand is very high. As we think about 2016 new unit development, we expect to open new restaurants at an even faster pace and are currently projecting a range of 220 to 235 new restaurants for next year. I will now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative and Development Officer : Thank you, Monty. During the quarter we continued our efforts to educate consumers about issues in food and our unique food culture through innovative marketing programs. In our promotion we called Friend or Faux, we challenged consumers to identify real friendly ingredients that align with our Food With Integrity vision and foe ingredients, artificial flavors, preservatives and additives by comparing our food to a representative set of food meals, such as burgers, sub sandwiches, and pizzas that are often manufactured with highly processed ingredients. People who played the game could win a buy one get one offer at Chipotle simply by comparing what's in our food against what's in traditional fast food. The idea for this promotion was to show the simplicity of Chipotle's food, all of which is classically prepared from just 68 ingredients across our entire menu compared to typical fast food where a single menu item can have upwards of 100 ingredients, many of which are chemical additives. The program launched in July and consumer participation exceeded our expectations with more than 750,000 people playing the game within the first 24 hours. In total, the program generated an average of 180,000 page views a day, totaling 7.5 million views over the duration of the program. The campaign message was clear with a large majority of respondents in a follow-up survey saying that they understood the intent a Friend or Faux, and that already positive views of Chipotle were strengthened by the program with three-quarters of respondents saying that it made them more interested in eating at Chipotle. And although sales did increase with these promotions in July, our long-term goal remains to engage our customers and educate them about the quality and simplicity of our food. We also introduced a retro style video game called Taste Invaders as another entertaining way to point out to customers some of the artificial ingredients found in typical fast food. The game, which is referred to as a galactic battle against artificial ingredients, has been played more than 2 million times and provides another creative path to learn more about the food Chipotle serves compared to the vast majority of other chain restaurants. We also continued to advertise nationwide throughout the summer months using traditional online, radio and outdoor media. Our goal to educate customers about where our food comes from and the simplicity of our ingredients is also being carried over to our annual burrito promotion and fundraiser this month. Because we've always believed that artificial ingredients simply aren't necessary for delicious flavorful food, we are asking our customers to add something unnecessary to their costumes October 31 in order to qualify for a $3 burrito. Burrito has become a favorite promotion for our customers and we expect will contribute $1 million to benefit the Chipotle Cultivate Foundation. Increasingly, our customers are ordering using their iPhone and Android devices or visiting our website to order online, and we continue to make improvements to enhance and simplify those user experiences. Our mobile and online sales continued to grow for the seventh consecutive quarter and currently represent more than 5% of topline sales, up more than 40% over last year. As we move forward, further investments in those platforms will be made with an eye toward developing tools and technologies to help our restaurant teams better manage and execute our out of store orders. Over the next year, we will also continue to improve and simplify our customers' ability to order their meals online. These investments are still at an early stage, but we believe that they will help us increase the quality of the experience for our guests ordering out of store and will help us grow this promising piece of our business. We've also added a new delivery partnership for customers who prefer that convenience. Ahead of the fall semester at colleges and universities across the country, we entered into a delivery partnership with Tapingo, a delivery service that targets college campuses and that is already well-liked and widely used. We are now delivering to 40 major campuses across the country through this partnership. Because it's so tailored to students, Tapingo service includes additional conveniences such as the ability to partner with university payment programs and deliver to dorm rooms and school buildings. Tapingo marks our third delivery partnership and collectively these valued delivery partners enable us to offer a delivery service throughout much of the country. Customers also continued to discover our catering. As of tomorrow, it will be two years since we rolled out catering options on a national level, which is available everywhere with the exception of New York City. And while we continue to gain traction in catering, we know there is still work to be done. Part of that work is to test and ultimately roll out an online platform that will allow customers to order and pay for their catering in advance and ultimately to have those orders delivered. Setting up delivery for catering is not a simple task, however, particularly when you consider that many of our catering orders are intended to serve up to 200 people. That's a lot of food to be delivered hot, fresh, and delicious in a way that meets our high standards and reflects positively on our brand. So we're going to need a partner that has the scale, reach, and capability to deliver those large orders. And so we'll be carefully pursuing potential partners and hope to have trials complete in late 2016. I'll now turn the call over to Jack. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Mark. Overall, we're pleased with the continued strength of our business during the third quarter despite lapping historically high same-store sales comparisons in 2014. We continue to grow our comps this quarter by 2.6%, which is on top of last year's comp of 19.8%, our highest as a public company. We're able to continue to grow even as our restaurants are now achieving volumes of more than $2.5 million on average, all of which can only be accomplished by having top-performing crews and management teams in place that are driven to create an exceptional dining experience for our customers. Overall sales for the quarter were up 12% to $1.2 billion driven by new restaurant openings and a 2.6% comp. Year-to-date sales were $3.5 billion, an increase of 15% over 2014. Our comp increase during the quarter was driven by a 1.9% increase in customer visits, which accelerated from the second quarter. Increasingly, more customers are connecting with our vision and they appreciate the real food made from wholesome, delicious ingredients using classic cooking techniques, and they appreciate that all of that just tastes better. Our sales comps were highest in July when our Friend or Faux campaign was in full force, but were lower in August and September. We were happy with the customer response and engagement with Friend or Faux during July as our customers who played the game learned about our simple wholesome ingredients and were treated to a BOGO for playing. During the third quarter, we also began implementing a targeted menu price increase on steak and barbacoa due to the sustained beef inflation and we will continue to roll this increase out across the remaining markets during the fourth quarter. This price increase is expected to contribute about 130 basis points when fully rolled out, and for the third quarter, this targeted menu price increase contributed about 70 basis points to the comp. Traffic trends during the first few weeks of October so far have been pretty choppy but overall, they're averaging about the same as what we saw during August and September, so slightly lower than the overall 2.6% comp in Q3. With the recent return of carnitas to 90% in our restaurants and expectation of getting that to 100% soon, we would expect Q4 comps will be similar to what we saw in Q3. For the full year, we continue to expect our overall comp will be in a low to mid-single-digits, and as we look to 2016, we expect the comps will remain in the low single digits. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $4.59, an increase of 11%, and year-to-date earnings per share was $12.92, a 26% increase over 2014. With 2,000 restaurants on the horizon and our restaurants currently achieving record volumes, we are very confident about what lies ahead as we continue toward our vision to change what people think about and eat fast food. Restaurant level margins during the quarter were 28.3%, a decrease of 50 basis points as higher labor and marketing costs were partially offset by lower food costs. Food costs were 33% in the quarter, down 10 basis point sequentially from Q2 and down 130 basis points compared to 2014. The decrease from the prior year was largely driven by lower costs for avocados and dairy, offset by sustained inflation for beef. We saw minimal inflation for the rest of our food during the quarter and we expect our food costs to stay in line with recent results through the end of the year. Our pricing for avocados has benefited this year as robust supply from Mexico has helped to keep prices down, while dairy prices remained low due to strong production and increased domestic supplies, a strong U.S. dollar has reduced dairy exports. For 2016, we expect food cost inflation will be relatively flat, and our food cost could decrease slightly depending on what happens to our beef costs. U.S. herd count for beef cattle continues to build and we may see some relief in the cost of naturally raised beef late in 2016. Labor costs were 22.2% of sales in the quarter, an increase of 100 basis points from last year, and year-to-date labor costs were up 40 basis points. After our last call in July, we made significant progress in reducing our labor cost inefficiencies and returned to what we would consider to be normal labor management and scheduling practices. This resulted in Q3 labor being lower than Q2 by 40 basis points. Labor de-leveraged versus last year by 100 basis points as a result of wage inflation, with our hourly wages up nearly 5% over last year, along with the cost of adding enhanced benefits such as tuition reimbursement, paid sick leave, and increased paid vacation for our hourly restaurant employees as we discussed during our Q2 earnings call. Going forward, we expect labor to be slightly higher than Q3 in the fourth quarter during the seasonally lower sales period. Occupancy costs were flat in the quarter compared to last year, and as Monty mentioned, we're lowering our overall development costs, which will further strengthen our unit economic model. Other operating costs were 11.1% in the quarter, an increase of 90 basis points versus last year, largely due to the timing of our marketing and promotions this year, including our Friend or Faux game and the increased spending surrounding summer advertising to keep Chipotle top of mind. Marketing was 1.5% of sales in the quarter, up 20 basis points from last year, and is expected to decline slightly in the fourth quarter. Promotion costs were 90 basis points during the quarter, up from 50 basis points last year. For 2016, we anticipate marketing expenses remain right around 1.5% to 1.6% of sales. G&A expenses were 5.8% during the quarter, down 80 basis points from the prior year and remember that 2014 included our biennial All Managers Conference, which also will occur in 2016. The conference cost around $10 million in 2014 and is expected to cost around $12 million in 2016. Lower stock-based compensation expense and lower bonus costs are also benefiting G&A for the quarter and for the year-to-date. Our non-cash, non-economic stock comp expense was $20.7 million in the quarter, down slightly from last. And for the first nine months, stock comp expense was $58.6 million, down from $83 million last year, and we expect the full-year charge this year will be about $78 million. During 2016, we expect our G&A, including stock-based comp, to grow at slower rate than sales, before considering the impact of the All Managers Conference. Stock comp for 2016 will depend on the stock price at the time of the grants and the number and the types of equity awards issued. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.7%, and we expect our effective full-year tax rate to also be 38.7%, and that compares to 37.6% for the full year of 2014. The tax rate in 2014 benefited from an increase in the estimate of useful state tax credits and from the work opportunity and the R&D federal tax credit, which have not been renewed by Congress for 2015. If those federal credits are extended to 2015, we estimate our tax rate would benefit by about 40 basis points and our effective tax rate for 2016 is expected to remain at around 38.7%. During the quarter, we repurchased about $30 million of our stock or approximately 46,000 shares at an average share price of $670. At the end of the third quarter, we had $155 million remaining on our share buyback program. We finished the quarter with $1.58 billion in cash and cash equivalents with no debt on the balance sheet and we continue to believe that the best use of cash is to invest in (28:15) opening our high-returning Chipotle restaurants in the U.S. and we'll continue to nurture our growth seed, including ShopHouse, Pizzeria Locale, and our international Chipotle restaurants so they will become a compelling use of capital in the future. In the meantime, we'll continue to repurchase shares of our stock opportunistically to enhance shareholder value. Thanks for your time today. And we'll be happy to open the lines for any questions you may have. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey. Good afternoon. So, just two questions, Jack. I guess on the carnitas, have you been seeing a bump then when carnitas returns to the restaurants? I know originally you thought it was about a 200 basis point penalty. And then separately on labor, I guess on the wage inflation at 5%, can you kind of dimensionalize what you think your underlying wage inflation is? I think you did some sort of step-up or adjustment in your wage schedule. So I'm not sure kind of how much of that was proactive versus reactive and what might be the ongoing run rate for 2016 for your wage inflation. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, Sharon, on carnitas, it's hard to tell because we just returned to 90%, and we finished September like just under 60% and we just hit 90% in the second half of September. It did look like in the markets that did get carnitas back that we did see some improvement during like the second week of October. But October's been still choppy so far that it's hard to tell. We did expect that based on when we suspended the sale of carnitas, we did see what we thought could be as much as a 200 basis points negative impact on the comps. So we're hoping we'll see that return. But it'll take a little bit more time for us to fully see that happen. In terms of wage inflation, a lot of that was proactive. We did have some isolated areas, we had San Francisco, we had parts of D.C., where there were minimum wage increases. And in most markets, we're above minimum wage, so that doesn't have an immediate impact. But just because of general competition for employees, just the expectation that we want to hire top performers and we want to be the employer of choice, we've been very proactive in making sure that not only our starting wages are competitive, but we also took a look at a number of our hourly managers during the summer to make sure that we're paying fair rates to them as well. So that was proactive. In terms of what to expect going forward, Sharon, I think it just depends on what the labor market looks like. I wouldn't expect it would stay at fully 5% year-after-year. So I don't know it would come down all the way to 5%, but I don't know that it's going to drop all the way down to 2%, which is what it had been running for the last, I'd say, two years or three years or four years. Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Operator : We'll go next to David Tarantino with Baird. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good afternoon. Jack, just a question on how you're viewing the recent trends in your business? And I know you mentioned that August and September were a little slower than July. Do you think you're seeing a change in the underlying momentum of the business? Or was that just more so related to the benefit you saw from the buy one, get one free promotion? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Well, definitely, David, the reason I wanted to go through the monthly comps is, July, we benefited. There was a lot of awareness, a lot of people playing the games, a lot of people earning and then redeeming the buy one, get one. And that always results in a short-term bump in sales. So, I would say that the July moving to September \u2013 or moving to August was more kind of a hangover effect from Friend or Faux. So we're kind of holding at that lower level, that low single digit level. Some of that also is due to very, very tough comparisons to last year. So I would say we're kind of just holding our own right now. I wouldn't say after the July bump that we got Friend or Faux, I would say we're just kind of holding our own. I don't think we're accelerating, but we're not \u2013 we're not decelerating, but I don't see us accelerating either. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. That's helpful. And then maybe a second question. You hired a new Chief Technology Officer recently. And I'm just wondering kind of big picture what we should expect to see from that hire. And does that include perhaps a strengthening of the mobile ordering platform or any of the other elements related to that? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. David, he hasn't even started yet. So, it would be premature to say exactly what we're going to do. But one way we think about the business is, about two-thirds of our business is eaten outside of a restaurant, but only 7% of our business is ordered outside of a restaurant. And so, there's a big gap between our customers who choose to or end up eating somewhere else other than a restaurant. So kind of makes sense for us to provide the convenience to order outside of a restaurant. And we do have \u2013 we have iPhone, we do have Android, but we can make that whole process more efficient. We can make it more reliable. And our customers, they love to go through the line because they have complete control, but I think there are ways for us to, between both a focus on operations on that second make line that Monty talked about, as well as looking at what technology opportunities are there, I think we can enhance their overall experience so that 7% can continue to grow over time. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you very much. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, David. Operator : We'll go next to Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. You guys did touch on it, but what was the duration of the Friend or Faux promotion and the approximate number of BOGO transactions you guys saw in the quarter? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : The promotion ran \u2013 was it about five weeks, Mark? Mark Alexee - Manager, Investor Relations : About six weeks. The total number of BOGOs I think was right around 2 million. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Was it that much? Okay. Mark Alexee - Manager, Investor Relations : I believe. Just under, perhaps. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And then just following up on that, so the ultimate impact on both Q3 transaction and mix, what was that for the quarter as well? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Well, the overall quarter, we did a 2.6% comp, 1.9% with transaction and 0.7%, 70 basis points, was from menu price increase. And that was the targeted \u2013 the vast majority was targeted menu price increases related to our steak and barbacoa. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : We'll go next to David Palmer with RBC. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Hi, David? David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good evening. Your throughput, you mentioned that the lunch hour declined a little bit. I realize it's peak daypart and during peak season, but how important do you think that was? And are you contemplating any significant adjustments to drive throughput? Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director: Yeah, I always think it is very important that we continue to focus on throughput. And I think that obviously coming off \u2013 we're sort of coming off our highest seasonality in terms of the crowds coming through our restaurants, and then simultaneously with a sort of lower transaction comp than we've been experiencing, I think what happens is sometimes our teams get focused on a number of other things : staffing, being a model, training new managers, on-boarding new crews. And then I think sometimes when things aren't moving \u2013 when the growth isn't quite as rapid, people get a little less excited about pushing throughput and really watching their four pillars execution. So I think that it's kind of a long way of saying it's \u2013 I think we took our eye off the ball a little bit. I think it happens sometimes, especially after a year of sort of the blistering comps at 19.8% a year ago during this time. During those times, it's very easy to keep throughput top of mind and have our crews be focused intensely on it. We had contests running. We had people excited about breaking throughput records, and just a lot of focus on it. And I think that the focus has waned a little bit. And that's not saying we want to see it continue, because throughput, even during slower growth times, and we have lines, and we have lines that cause some people to want to walk away. And so we are going to work to replenish and reinvigorate our teams to focus on throughput and on execution of the four pillars of throughput because it is still an enormously huge competitive advantage for us and a huge part of customer service. So even though it's only a falloff of one transaction, we do look to gain transactions. And as you've seen from the previous several years, even at our core lunch hour, we had gained transactions almost every quarter. So we don't like to see it fall off on, but we're glad to have retained the really significant gains we made during 2013 and 2014, but we'd like to improve on that still more. David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Just a quick follow-up on David's question about mobile order and the fact that you have mobile order already, a lot of people are focusing on that for Starbucks and they're \u2013 that's making great strides for them. You improved your mobile order earlier this year. It feels like a lot of people don't know about it. Is it just \u2013 to some degree, is it just about marketing what you have? Or do you think this is going to be more about improving the mobile order technology (37:51)? Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer : Well, we've deliberately under-marketed our mobile ordering, and the reason for that is fairly simple. We just have not quite optimized the experience in the restaurants to the point where we feel comfortable driving a large number of people in there. I mean, we're working on all of those improvements. So we don't want somebody to go in, make a mobile order and go in and have a degraded experience. And so, all of the growth that we've seen on mobile has essentially been without any marketing at all. So there is a tremendous amount of potential, but as we talked about in our prepared comments, we really want to optimize the experience before we really drive people in the \u2013 the mobile experience, so. Additionally, we think that we have the ability to drive a lot of traffic through mobile ordering and that will go to our second make line in the back of the house. We think that potentially, we could overwhelm that second make line, so we have started to retool that second make line to have at least the same capacity as our mainline. By the way, it doesn't take extra space in the kitchen, which is good news, but it does take some retooling. So, it needs to be a combination of both the marketing of that technology, with increasing the capacity of the second make line. David S. Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. On the same-store sales guidance, it seems low single-digits for 2016 reflects significant deceleration on a two-year and three-year basis. Of course, there is some price that's likely to fall off, but what are the other factors driving deceleration or would you say that low single-digits is a function more of conservatism? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Well, the way I would think about it, Andrew, is that we just finished a three-year trend, and I've talked about this on some earlier calls. If you go back and look to 2013, we started a new trend where we started in low single-digit comps, and we kind of built our comps for the next several quarters. We had a price increase in 2014. But if you combine the last three years \u2013 and this is kind of the end of that trend \u2013 our three-year comps are up in the high 27%-28% range. We now need to start a new trend because we started that momentum. And if you look quarter by quarter to quarter, you can see that the momentum builds for several quarters, it levels off. It peaked last year at 19.8%, and then as you are comparing through multiple years, up double digit comps. And none of this is based on gimmicks, on promotions, on discounting or anything like that. It's really just inviting more customers in; they have a great experience, they want to come back. So it's an education that Mark and the team have done with things like Scarecrow and things that raise the awareness of where food comes from, why our food is different and our customers have been able during this three-year trend to connect the dots between why the food they love so much, why it tastes so good because it comes from these great ingredients, because the food is prepared using classic cooking techniques \u2013 there's real cooking going on in our restaurants. And so right now, we're in this challenge where we've got three years of growing our sales by 27%-28%, and comparing to that is difficult. And so what we're hoping will happen is, we'll be able to ignite another trend, another three-year trend. When that will happen with the order of magnitude of that happening is very difficult to predict, but over the last 10 years-15 years, Chipotle has these kind of waves of comps, and most of it is around creating awareness and appreciation for what we do at Chipotle. Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Steve, just a separate question : just in answer to last question, you talked about you need to retool the second make line. It's not going to involve extra room, but can you give any sense for what really needs to be done there? Is it sense of execution of four pillars? Is it more around labor training? Any kind of direction would be helpful. Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Well, it wouldn't be four pillars in that there is a dedicated crew person or two, depending on volume, to that make line. So, it's not the same deployment. But there are a lot of things having to do with capacity of the bin size in the \u2013 as you hold hot and cold food, the bin size right now is very small, so retooling that to have larger capacity. Also, the way we scoop can be improved using different kinds of utensils that are more efficient that might not be appropriate for the mainline, but are very efficient in the back of a house. And then also, the way orders come in, right now they come in on a paper chit, if you well, which has to be read. So there are different technologies that we are looking at right now, and we've been going through this process to determine which one is going to be best for us. But they involve different ways that the orders can be indicated to the crew people so that they can make these orders much faster, much more efficiently. So, it's an exciting project and it's moving fast and keeping pace with the ability to roll out this technology. Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Karen Short from Deutsche Bank. Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just, first question just on the fourth quarter comp guidance. I guess the guidance seems a little light or conservative, I guess, in light of the price increases, and I know you gave some color on October, but any more color in terms of what the composition of the comp has been so far in October? And then, I just had a follow-up. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : October would be similar, but there maybe a little bit more menu pricing in October, but not much more. So I would say the makeup of the comp is similar in terms of we're running about a 70 basis point price increase, maybe that's 80 basis points or 90 basis points, something like that. We will gradually get that up to 130 basis points. We hope it does prove to be conservative, and maybe it is conservative, but October is still choppy right now. It really isn't giving us any indication of what the current underlying pattern is. And so, I hope that when we report in January, we'll come back and you all will say, yeah, you guys were too conservative. But right now, with what we saw, finishing the quarter and what we saw in October being very, very choppy, it's very difficult to read. Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay. And then just actually in response to the last question, I mean, I know you commented that you have seen waves of comps, I guess, and I think what you said is that the waves have generally revolved around awareness. But I guess maybe a little color. Is history on what has driven your comps really relevant, I guess, in terms of what might drive the next wave? I guess the way I see it, I mean, the competitive environment has and is changing rapidly, as is technology. So maybe just your thoughts there. Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director: Well, of course our comps going forward are likely to be different than historical, but we still find that there's lots of people that either aren't aware of Chipotle or they're aware of Chipotle, but they don't know about where our food comes from. They don't know that we're doing real cooking. I mean, this happens to me all time. We just got an email from a former colleague of ours who's in Florida, moved down to Florida, and he says out of 10 people, as many as seven or eight or nine of them have never been to Chipotle before. And so there is still this opportunity to educate people, one, that we exist, which that is changing over time because as we are in more markets, more and more people know about Chipotle but they don't necessarily know that we are using classic (46:14) cooking techniques. They don't necessarily know that we do things like source naturally raised meats and we have a local program during the right seasons, and things like that. And so that's something that we all bump into people all the time that don't fully understand that. So there's still awareness around why Chipotle is different. There are lots of competitors out there \u2013 and this makes I think the messaging more difficult \u2013 that our messaging, that they're doing something that is more natural or that would imply that there's higher-quality there. And so that does make the message more clear, but we believe that the source of where our comp will come from will still come from educating people about Chipotle, increasing the awareness about why we're different from others. And we've had a great experience where people come in and try Chipotle and they have a great dining experience. They tend to want to come back and so while, yes, it's more challenging, yes, we have higher volumes, yes, there are more competitors out there, generally our job is or our challenge is to get more people to understand and come to Chipotle more often. Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks very much. Operator : We'll go next to Jason West from Credit Suisse. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. A couple questions. Jack, on the pricing, the 1.3% that's tied to the beef items, you had also mentioned on the last call some pricing in certain minimum wage markets. Is that on top of the 1.3% or is that included in that run rate? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : It's included, Jason, but the only reason why we didn't point it out, it's just very, very small. Right now it's literally a handful of restaurants, a few dozen restaurants. And so it's a very small part of the 130 basis points. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Got it. And as you're thinking about next year and we do have some wage pressures, it sounds like food costs, not really a big pressure. How are you thinking about the next wave of pricing, when you'd want to start looking at that? Is wage pressure something that you want to get ahead of as we get into next year? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, we don't have any plans right now for any kind of a national price increase to deal with wage pressure, but we do have a number of isolated markets, a number of which are coming up in January. We'll take the same approach that we took with \u2013 we talked about it, I think it was on the last quarter, and it was in the San Francisco area and then also in the, I think it was the mid-Atlantic area. We had a couple of markets that had pretty significant increases in minimum wage. Generally, we're not affected by minimum wage, but in some cases, the minimum wages are being increased to $10, $11, $12 per hour, and those will have some impact. We don't automatically increase prices in those markets. What we do is, we look at all the cost of doing business in that area. And in the two cases that we mentioned last quarter, we increased prices there because not only our wage is up, but those areas already had a higher cost of doing business, things like higher occupancy cost and local taxes and things like that. And when we looked at competition, the competition was pretty aggressive in raising prices. So we'll do the same thing with minimum wage increases on a market-by-market basis, and we'll make the decisions on a market-by-market basis based on the wages, other cost of doing business, what the competitors are doing and what our current margins are. We'll consider all those factors. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Keith Siegner with UBS. Keith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Jack, you highlighted $1.58 billion in cash. You highlighted how the best use of that is to put it towards new unit opens. You're already accelerating Chipotle opens. This year is above target, next year is even more. How close are we to accelerating the unit opens for ShopHouse and Pizzeria Locale? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : I hate to put a timeline on it. We are accelerating to a certain degree, but I assume what you mean is to really ramp it up aggressively. They're still in the nurturing phase, it's still in the brand building phase. When we open up a new restaurant, it behaves a lot like Chipotle 12 years, 15 years ago, when we went into a new market where it's an unfamiliar brand, it takes a while for customers to figure out what ShopHouse is. Pizzeria Locale, while it's pizza, it's pizza that may be unfamiliar to customers that are used to traditional pizza. And so there's still a brand building and an understanding of what we're doing, very similar to what we saw with Chipotle in the early days. We're seeing encouraging signs, like we're seeing some very strong comps in the markets that we've opened. It's why we've done things like \u2013 with ShopHouse, we're going to open a new market in Chicago. And so it gives us now three different markets where the brand building and the awareness is being created. With Pizzeria Locale, the same thing, we will \u2013 very soon we're in two markets, right now we'll be in a third market. So I think we're planting the right seeds. We're doing it in a number of markets where more and more customers will be able to visit these restaurants to figure out what's different about ShopHouse, Pizzeria Locale. And as we see the awareness build, as we see the comps continue to build, just like we did with Chipotle in the early days, we'll continue to invest in those markets. And I would say this is a very similar reaction to what we're seeing in Europe. We're seeing very attractive sales comps. We're seeing some inconsistency in the way the stores open. Some open hot and open up pretty high right away, and some it takes a little time to build. So they're still what we consider to be in the early brand building stage, but we're seeing some encouraging signs. Keith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. And maybe one quick one for Mark. If we really are going through this three-year cycle, this is a point where the company is very well flush with cash, the traffic is a little lower in this part of the three-year cycle, when we talked about some of these other awareness issues. Why not use this as a perfect opportunity to really put some money into the marketing program for long-term brand awareness, long-term brand building actions to kind of cement that relationship and awareness for the Food With Integrity? Why not step up some of those efforts a little more at this part of the cycle? Thanks. Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director: Well, I'd say that we actually probably are stepping it up in some regards. I mean, one thing that I think is important to understand about our strategy here is that we deliberately spend less on our marketing so that we can afford these higher quality ingredients. And that's essentially the main benefit, the main marketing benefit to our customers. And so we find different ways to tell that story, entertaining ways to do it, but we have recently shifted our focus more to telling the basic story about where our ingredients come from and how they're made. And we've significantly increased our focus on digital marketing, which we've found to be very effective. We're going to be using some more of our in-store assets to communicate some of these messages like our packaging. And so I think we're doing it. I think what you won't see from us, though, is some people might think ramping up would mean head to television or something like that. The problem with television beyond the expense, is that it's really, really tailored toward 30-second spots which really only deliver if you have some sort of promotional or call-to-action message in them, which is a very slippery slope. So we're going to stay the course on telling this brand story, but we're working on several large initiatives similar to the ones you've seen in the past as well as what I just mentioned, which is an increased focus on digital and in-store communications. So I'd say we are ramping it up in some way, yeah. Keith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. Nicole Miller-Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Good afternoon. When you look at comps in October, November, and December of last year, just like you gave us an idea of what was your best and worst this past quarter, does it get easier or more difficult as you exit this current quarter, please? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : It's similar, Nicole, because even though we had a lower comp last year at 16%, if we do a comp that's similar in the fourth quarter to what we saw in the third quarter, you'll see a three-year comp, and I keep going back to this three-year trend. That will be very similar. Okay, so it feels about the same. I wouldn't say it's any tougher; I wouldn't say it's any easier. It feels like it's a very similar comparison. Nicole Miller-Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): In each month? Okay. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, in each month and they bounce around with the holidays, but I wouldn't say there's anything out of the ordinary within the quarter that is out of the ordinary worth pointing out. Nicole Miller-Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): And I'm sorry, I missed it. Was it $165 million remaining on share repurchase or $135 million? Unknown Speaker : $155 million. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : $155 million, so right in the middle of what you had. Nicole Miller-Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): $155 million. Okay. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : $155 million, yeah \u2013 one five five. Nicole Miller-Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): And then just a big picture question, with the acceleration in development, are you finding more sites that are perfect for Chipotle? Or is this also a benefit of the nearly 5,000 hires you made recently that Monty was talking about earlier? Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director: No, this is really \u2013 our real estate people throughout the field are gaining confidence in that we've gone into a lot of smaller or sort of newer markets or off the beaten path markets lately with a lot of success, and our new store openings continue to be at a very solid volume. And so I guess just the confidence of our teams in the field who are out looking for real estate is very, very high that they can confidently sign deals. And also, we are better known than ever as a tenant. We're better trusted than ever by landlords, and so we're a very sought after tenant. And given a little bit better availability of money, I mean people are willing to build an endcap with us in mind or build a three-unit complex and put us in it. And so we are able to just find a whole lot of deals even while walking away from deals and striking a relatively harder bargain. And also, our team has been organized in a new way that's more efficient, that's allowed us to work really, really well together, and with our increased confidence, the team is just feeling great. And they're producing a lot of great sites with really great terms, with great tenant improvement allowances and building these things for less than we did last year, which is superb. But it really isn't any result of our hiring. Our hiring is something we did because we're really trying to become staffed as well as we can in our existing restaurants, to have an adequate complement of people to build it for our future leadership, and have a great base and being able to build when we do build new restaurants. Nicole Miller-Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Thanks, Monty. Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director: Yeah. You bet, Nicole. Thanks. Operator : And at this time, for closing remarks, I would like to turn the call back over to Investor Relations Manager, Mark Alexee. Mark Alexee - Manager, Investor Relations : Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. We appreciate your time. We look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter and yearend call in January. Thanks again. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Monty Moran, Co-Chief Executive Officer; Mark Crumpacker, Chief Creative and Development Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve. Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everybody. The fourth quarter was without question the most challenging in our history, but we have responded and have implemented an industry-leading food safety program that reduces our food safety risk to as low to zero as possible. And yesterday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that its E. coli investigation is over. And as we emerge from this difficult time, we can focus on what will be our primary objective for 2016 : making sure our food is as safe as possible and welcoming customers back to our restaurants as our teams deliver an extraordinary dining experience. We're grateful for the way our restaurants and support departments have responded over the last few months. We've been asking a lot of our teams and they effectively implemented substantial improvements to our food safety practices. These new enhanced standards will establish Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety. While this has been an unfortunate set of events, I am confident that Chipotle will emerge as a stronger company than we were before our recent challenges. Since opening the first Chipotle restaurant 22 years ago, it has been our aim to serve our guests food that is safe, delicious and wholesome, but the events of the last few months have shown us that we need to do better. The issues we are dealing with throughout the quarter adversely impacted our performance. During the quarter, our revenue was $998 million, a decrease of 7% on a comparable restaurant sales decline of 15%. For the full year, revenue increased 10% to $4.5 billion, with comparable restaurant sales flat for the full year. This produced diluted earnings of $2.17 per share for the quarter, a decrease of 43%, and diluted earnings per share of $15.10 for the full year, an increase of 7%. The pace of new restaurant openings was not affected by recent events, and we opened 79 new restaurants during the quarter, bringing our total number of openings to 229 for the year. We finished the year with 2,010 restaurants in total. To achieve our goal of establishing Chipotle as a leader in food safety, we have completed a comprehensive reassessment of our supply chain and restaurant practices from the farms and ranches that supply our ingredients to the restaurants where we are serving customers to evaluate each and every ingredient. The objective of this food safety system is that we will reduce the risk of something like this happening again in our restaurants to as near to zero as possible. In developing this plan, we established testing and safety protocols that go well beyond industry standard to ensure the quality and safety of all of our ingredients. The plan is designed to prevent unsafe food from ever entering our restaurants through the use of extensive testing and through washing in central kitchens. And even in the unlikely event that some pathogen still finds its way into our restaurants, we've improved our restaurant procedures to provide additional protection to prevent contamination of our food. Among the specific components of this enhanced food safety system and plan are : high-resolution DNA-based testing of fresh produce and meats to identify harmful bacteria in these ingredients before they enter our supply. Under this testing protocol, a batch of any ingredient that does not meet our testing standards will be rejected well before it reaches our restaurants. These testing programs will allow us to continually improve our supply chain. Second, we have also added important changes to food handling and food preparation procedures, including: preparing tomatoes, lettuce and bell pepper in central kitchen and blanching certain produce items including avocados, onions, jalape\u00f1os and citrus in our restaurants before they are used, and a new procedure for marinating chicken and steak, which now happens distinct from and after the preparation of other fresh items. We're also marinating chopped onions, jalape\u00f1os and cilantro in citrus juice when we make salsas and guacamole. This process brings out more flavor from these ingredients and adds another measure of food safety. And third, we have an enhanced crew training program to be sure all of our teams understand all of the facets of our new food safety program. Through education about food-borne illness and explaining why we have made these changes, we can assure that we are empowering our employees to carry out all of these new protocols. While individual elements of this food safety program stand on their own as risk mitigation steps, it's the combination of multiple layers of mitigation that provide us a high level of confidence in our food safety enhancements. The comprehensive nature of these enhancements is designed not only to address our ingredients and preparation procedures, but also to offer redundancies that will improve food safety and help Chipotle become an industry standard in this area. Of course, none of the changes affect our commitment to Food With Integrity, and we'll continue on our quest to find more sustainably raised ingredients including responsibly raised meat, organically grown produce and pasture-raised dairy, and we'll also expect to continue our local produce program when the local growing season returns this spring. We've established Chipotle as an industry leader by focusing on doing a few things very well. It starts by buying high-quality raw ingredients, preparing them using classic cooking techniques and serving them by friendly people in an interactive format so every customer gets exactly what they want, and by creating a unique people culture where top performers are empowered to achieve high standards and can deliver an exceptional and compelling customer experience. And now with our enhanced food safety program, we are poised to emerge stronger than ever before. Ultimately, we believe that this is what is best for our company and our employees and our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Monty. Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director: Thank you, Steve. We remain grounded in the vision of what makes Chipotle great : our amazing food made with high quality ingredients and classic cooking techniques and our unique people culture consisting of top performers empowered to achieve high standards. In 2016, we will leverage both our food culture and people culture as we focus on our two primary objectives for the year : ensuring the safest food possible and providing a terrific customer service and excellent restaurant experience. Since these challenges began and we started moving very quickly to address them, we've asked a lot of our restaurant teams, and they have responded very well, implementing improved procedures and techniques that will help make our food as safe and delicious as possible. Not only have our teams been diligent in doing all that we've asked of them, but they've been eager to adopt new techniques to further improve food safety in our restaurants. Now that the CDC investigation is over, our crews are excited to welcome customers back into our restaurants. Maintaining teams of top performers who are empowered to achieve high standards has been one of the key drivers of our business for many years now. Having such dedicated restaurant support teams enabled us to very quickly implement our enhanced food safety systems and achieve our goal of establishing Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety. Our restaurant teams are already well-versed on the new procedures they have implemented in their restaurants, but that represents just one part of our overall food safety plan. To share the entire plan with our employees, we are holding a national team meeting on February 8. The meeting will be broadcast live via satellite to hundreds of offsite locations across the country. In order for our employees to attend the meeting, we will be opening our restaurants at 3 p.m. that day. This meeting is an opportunity for us to describe in detail to our whole team all of the steps that we have taken to make our food safer before it ever arrives at the restaurants as well as to highlight and explain the reasons behind some of the new procedures that have already been implemented in our restaurants. We know that our hard-working employees will continue to play a critical role establishing Chipotle as a leader in food safety, and this meeting will also provide us with an opportunity to thank them for their hard work and dedication. In addition to the testing, preparation changes, and training Steve discussed, we're also expanding our in-restaurant auditing programs. Under our new plan, our field leaders have been formally auditing every single restaurant on a weekly basis. And each restaurant will also be subject to quarterly audits by a third-party vendor. We are taking this expanded auditing program very seriously and changing incentives for managers and field leaders accordingly. Beginning in 2016, scores from our third-party auditor will account for half of our managers' bonuses. We believe this compensation realignment will further underscore for our managers and teams just how important it is to properly execute our food safety procedures, and all of this will help us in establishing a heightened culture of food safety in all of our restaurants. The other half of this bonus structure is tied to welcoming customers back to the restaurants. So our entire incentive compensation structure is designed around food safety and customer service. We're also completing a comprehensive food tracing system that will allow us to locate each ingredient we use from its source, such as the individual farm where it was produced, through our distribution system and our individual restaurants in real-time. This system uses barcodes on each package of each ingredient. Ingredients are scanned at the source and subsequently at each point through the supply chain. As of today, this system is largely in place and allows us to track ingredients from the source to the distribution center. There is value in this type of data, as completion of the program will give us the ability to follow the movement and get information on ingredients through our entire system, in much the same way a package would be tracked through an overnight delivery service. Our extraordinary people culture and top-performing leaders are more important than ever before and they give us confidence that we will succeed in our mission of becoming an industry leader in food safety. Experience has shown us that our restaurants are at their very best when we establish restaurateur cultures, so we will continue to emphasize the development of these excellent leaders who will ensure that our restaurants consistently provide extraordinary restaurant experiences. While food safety will be a primary focus in 2016, our expectations for e-commerce programs and our growth seed restaurants remain largely unchanged as we have dedicated teams focused on these growth initiatives. However, I would note that we are going to leverage the new improved techniques that we're instituting at Chipotle to make sure that our growth seeds are also excelling in food safety. Likewise, we will also be applying the same approach to the enhanced ingredient testing that will take place outside the restaurants. Lastly, we're continuing to cooperate in the grand jury investigation in California. We had anticipated that the investigation might broaden into a more national investigation, and last week, we received a new subpoena replacing the one we had announced in early January. The new subpoena requires us to produce documents and information related to company-wide food safety matters dating back as far as January 1, 2013. So we'll continue to cooperate in the investigation as it moves forward. As you know, yesterday the CDC called the E. coli investigation over. This is a milestone that has generated a lot of excitement from both customers and employees alike. Our employees have implemented an industry-leading food safety program and they are eagerly looking forward to doing what they do best : serving amazing food and empowering others to achieve high standards. And now, the CDC has confirmed that this incident is behind us and resolved, which helps to serve as an all-clear signal to our customers that may've been hesitant in recent months. On our end, we will make sure our teams are ready to deliver an exceptional dining experience to each and every one of our customers when they return. I'll now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative & Development Officer : Thank you, Monty. Based on an expectation that the CDC would likely declare the E. coli outbreaks over during the first week of February, many of our marketing programs are teed up to begin next week. Our marketing activities include both proactive PR communications and traditional marketing programs designed to increase customer visits. Before I discuss the marketing activities, I'll provide an overview of our current customer research. Starting November 1, we have been running both daily and weekly research studies in order to keep close track of customer awareness and perception. Not surprisingly, consumer awareness of the issues we have been dealing with for the last few months is high. Our most current research indicates that 63% of Chipotle customers and 60% of fast casual diners in general are aware of the food-borne illness issues at Chipotle. Of those who are our customers and who are also aware of the issues, right around 60% have indicated that it would cause them to visit less. While this research data's obviously not good news, our weekly data for the last two weeks is encouraging as it indicates a leveling off of what was a downward trend that started in late October. We have seen a leveling off and in some cases a slight increase in consideration, admiration, first-time visits and date last visited. This is good news as our customers are indicating willingness to return to the restaurants. We are confident that with the news yesterday from the CDC and our ongoing efforts to communicate all the changes we've implemented at Chipotle, that we will see steady improvement in customer sentiment. And our research also indicates that once consumers are aware that food safety issues have been resolved, that many of them will come back into our restaurants. Beginning next week, we are launching a variety of marketing programs designed to invite our customers back into our restaurants. This effort includes a large traditional advertising campaign that covers all of our major markets with outdoor, radio, print and digital advertising. This campaign is the largest in company history, and this current wave is scheduled to run from February through the end of June. The creative for this campaign with one small exception does not mention food safety or the recent incidents. Instead, it reinforces our commitment to high-quality ingredients and great tasting food. In addition to traditional advertising, we're launching a large direct marketing campaign using traditional direct mail, mobile and social marketing platforms. Again, this will be the largest direct marketing effort in the company's history. The direct marketing efforts begin on February 8 and will continue through May, with the last expiration date being May 15. Other promotions including a Big Game catering promotion and a digital game called Guac Hunter will also be occurring during this timeframe. While most of these activities are focused on Q1 and Q2, we will, of course, be marketing throughout the year. We will use the response from these initial efforts to determine specific plans for the second half of the year. We will also continue with our Cultivate Food and Music Festival series. This year the festivals will be held in Phoenix, Kansas City and Miami. Our marketing spend for the first half of the year will be significantly higher than previous years. And as we develop plan for the second half of the year, we also expect increased marketing costs for the full year. In addition to our advertising and direct marketing efforts, we are continuing with proactive communications designed to ensure that our customers are confident that it's safe to eat at Chipotle. On February 8, we're launching a new food safety website which outlines all the steps we have taken in order to make our food as safe as possibly can be. The site also reaffirms our commitment to Food With Integrity. What is most important is that we have implemented a comprehensive food safety plan. And now that the recent CDC investigation is behind us, we are confident that our aggressive marketing and communication will help welcome many lapsed and new customers into Chipotle. I'll now turn the call over to Jack. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks Mark. For those of you that have been following our company over the last 10 years, 2016 will be a very different year for Chipotle as we emerge from last year's events. We believe that we've outlined a thoughtful and effective strategy to restore confidence in our brand and we will be laser-focused on two things : first, implementing industry-leading food safety protocols, and second, working relentlessly to welcome our customers back to Chipotle. There will be costs to our new food safety program; so we expect to see lower operating margin this year until our sales trends begin to recover. But we're confident that we can win our customers back and as they return to our restaurants over time, our margins can return to industry-leading levels. Sales during the fourth quarter were extremely volatile. Although comps for the quarter decreased 14.6% overall, the adverse impact became more severe throughout the quarter as awareness remained high. After posting a low single-digit positive comp in October, we had a negative 16% comp in November and a negative 30% comp in December. While December comps started out at a similar level as in November, the comp worsened significantly following the national attention surrounding the Boston norovirus incident around December 7. Excluding that first week of sales, December comps averaged down about 34%. For the month of January, sales comps were down about 36%, worse than the December run rate due to tougher January comparisons, weather in the Northeast, and continued negative publicity. Comparisons become easier in February, but more importantly, we're anxious to begin the process of welcoming our customers back, which will begin in February with the marketing and PR that Mark talked about. Our teams are excited, staffed, and ready to provide a terrific experience to our customers when they return. As we aggressively work to welcome our customers back, labor management and P&L controls in general will not be a priority. Instead our teams will schedule labor assuming a steep recovery because we would much rather be overstaffed and offer great customer service including wonderful throughput than to risk being shorthanded as a result of trying to over-manage labor costs. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $2.17. This was above our expected range listed in our recent 8-K. And the main driver behind higher EPS was a revaluation of noncash stock comp expense related to our three-year performance shares in consideration of our current forecast for 2016. This added $15 million to pre-tax income or about $0.31 to diluted EPS. Our margins and EPS results will continue to be negatively affected by three main forces during this recovery. Those three forces include : one, deleverage from lower sales, two, increased discretionary costs such as marketing and promotional costs as well as higher labor as we staff to welcome customers back, and three, ongoing cost to support our newly designed food safety program. The impact of lower sales levels is the most significant impact on our margins and results overall, and the impact flows through the entire P&L. Our restaurant level margins were 19.6% in the fourth quarter, which is down 700 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, even though food costs were down 120 basis points. So in essence, our margins are really down over 800 basis points considering the lower food costs. Of this 820-basis-point drop, the vast majority or over 500 basis points of that change came from sales deleverage flowing through the entire restaurant P&L. Margins declined an additional 160 basis points related to nonrecurring costs such as food waste or related testing, and we lost another 150 basis points due to inefficiencies along with the beginning of new recurring costs to support our new food safety protocols. So obviously, the highest priority is to do everything possible to bring customers back in and ensure that they are treated with terrific experience. And if we're successful in doing so, we know that we can eventually recover margins lost due to the deleveraging of sales and we're also confident that we can recover inefficiencies that have arisen as we navigate through this challenge. The nonrecurring costs during the fourth quarter included about 70 basis points in food costs related to the discarding of food and costs related to extensive testing related to the investigation. We also had about 60 basis points in other operating expenses, including new food safety kitchen equipment, increased insurance expense, and marketing costs to help plan for our 2016 promotions. Finally, there was a $3 million charge related to the upgrading of some of our equipment, which hit the loss on disposal of assets line. There will be a recurring cost of implementing these enhanced food safety programs, and although this is still a preliminary estimate, we believe there will be a net recurring cost of around 200 basis points. This covers changes and procedures performed in our central kitchens and additional testing in our supply chain net of potential labor savings. Most of these higher costs will be captured on our food cost line, which will result in estimated food costs for the full year 2016 of about 35%. There will also be about 20 basis points of new, ongoing costs tied to the new food safety programs within the other operating cost line as we incur a higher cost tied to new food safety audits and equipment and materials associated with our new food safety programs. Over time, we expect that there will be some modest labor savings to offset our increased food safety costs, but we're cautious about expecting these in the near term until we begin to recover sales and gain efficiencies in our food safety program and also as we invest in increased labor to support higher promotional sales. Our main objective in the short term will be to invest in labor to be fully staffed, highly trained, and ready to deliver an extraordinary customer experience as we invite our customers back into our restaurants. In addition to these ongoing structural costs related to food safety, 2016 will also incur an additional 50 basis points of marketing expenses compared to prior years and an additional 70 basis points of promotional expenses as we accelerate our ability to recover customers. Much of this will be front-loaded in the first quarter. And we expect marketing to be around 3.5% of sales and combined marketing and promotion costs to be around 6% of sales, which is over four times the combined marketing and promo as a percent of sales in the first quarter of last year. For the full year, I would caution that we may choose to continue a higher marketing and promotional investment level later in the year, depending on customer reaction and the state of our business. We also expect our total G&A costs will be around $65 million higher for the full year in 2016 compared to 2015. The higher G&A is driven by performance-related factors from 2015 such as : reduced bonuses, which were $17 million in 2015 lower than 2014; and lower stock comp of around $18 million, primarily as a result of re-valuing the three-year performance shares granted to executives in 2015. We will also have additional costs in 2016 related to our all manager conference in the third quarter of $11 million, along with normal growth in G&A to support our growing restaurant base. We will continue to invest in our future growth today, but once our sales are fully recovered, we would expect future G&A to grow at a slower rate than sales. Overall, 2016 will be a year of significant investment to ensure our food is safe and to encourage our customers to return to Chipotle. Margins and earnings will be significantly affected as we make these important investments. But I'm still confident that as we recover sales, over time, we can also fully recover our margins and our earnings capabilities. Given the continued volatility of our sales trends, it's impossible to provide any meaningful outlook for sales comps or margins for the full year 2016. If appropriate, we will provide interim updates on sales trends as we have done with our two previously filed 8-Ks. While we cannot predict the magnitude and timing of our sales recovery, we can provide some perspective on the impact on margins at various comp levels. For example, when comps are down 30%, the combined impact of deleveraging, along with the added marketing and ongoing food costs, food safety costs I talked about earlier, would result in expected restaurant level margins in the low double-digit range. If comps were to recover to down 20%, we would expect restaurant margins in the mid teens to high teens. And if sales fully recover, we would expect restaurant margin to be in the mid-20% range, as we would recapture the margins related to deleveraging, but still be funding the higher costs of the food safety programs. Of course, our margin recovery will lag our comp recovery as we don't plan to be highly efficient in managing labor and the rest of the P&L while our primary focus is welcoming and delighting our customers. So this should give you a general idea of how the recovery might unfold. Specific to the first quarter, which will represent a significant investment in our future, when you combine the rough start in comps so far in January, the higher marketing and promo investment, the higher expected investment in labor to wow our customers, the fully loaded ongoing costs for our food safety program, the cost of hosting our all-company meeting, and the higher G&A, it is likely we will post an EPS that is around break-even for the quarter. Q1 is clearly a heavy investment quarter, and if these investments pay off with a steady recovery of customers, the second, third and fourth quarters will improve dramatically. Also for the full year, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be around 39%, slightly higher than the 2015 tax rate of 38.2% due to slightly higher state taxes. We continue to be opportunistic in repurchasing our stock. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $338 million of stock at an average share price of $556, with more than $200 million purchased in the month of December alone at an average price of $527. During January, we purchased an additional $238 million at an average weighted price of $440 per share, even though January had two less trading days than December. As of January 1, we maintained slightly over $1 billion of cash and investments, which means we continue to be in a position to opportunistically repurchase stock. And today we're announcing that our Board has approved an additional $300 million of share repurchases, bringing our total life-to-date authorization to $1.9 billion. As of January 31, including the new $300 million authorization, we have $478 million remaining to repurchase stock. What's most important right now is that we remain focused on executing our food safety protocols and enticing customers to come back to Chipotle and enjoy terrific meals served by enthusiastic teams. We continue to believe in the strength of the Chipotle brand and the opportunity to return to an industry-leading economic model, which we know has the potential to create significant value for our shareholders. Thanks for your time today, and we'd be happy to open the line for questions you may have. Operator : And we will hear first from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Thank you very much. As we think about the ability for you guys to get back to the average unit volumes that you were at before the incident, I think it'd just be helpful for all of us to know how you think about your customer base. Meaning, what percentage of your sales volumes before the incident did you see from very heavy customers that you think are going to be much easier to reel back in, versus what percentage of your sales volumes were from much less frequent customers that that you may see as much more difficult to get back? Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative & Development Officer : Yeah, that's a good question. We break our customers into five frequency bands. We call them new or lapsed customers, light, medium, heavy and what we call our top loyal customers. Our top loyal customers are the ones that come 25 times or more a year. When we look at the research, we actually saw a falloff in both the top loyal and the new customers, which isn't unexpected with regard to the new customers, they're not as familiar with the brand. We saw a small drop off in that top loyal, so it is definitely one of the targets that we're going after with our proactive communications. They tend to be people that we can communicate with relatively easily via social media, and many of them are part of our mobile and email marketing databases. So we're definitely going to be targeting them. That group of people can represent up to 20% of our sales, so it's a very important part of our group. And so what I'll say is we're going after them. We also expect, though, as part of our overall advertising program, that we're going to get new customers. There are still plenty of people who have never been to Chipotle in the United States, and we're going to invite them in, too. So we're going after both that very loyal group and brand-new customers as well. Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): And, Jack, just to clarify what you said. So if you get back to your AUVs pre-incident, are you saying we should expect kind of a mid-20%ish type restaurant margin? (31:42) John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, I think we would get back to our full \u2013 our high 20% margins \u2013 27%, 28%, something like that except for the cost of our ongoing food safety program. And that would be a couple hundred basis points. Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Makes sense. Okay, thank you. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks. Operator : Next we'll hear from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you talk about how the employees are feeling? I know you're going to talk to them next week, but is there any increased turnover as they're concerned about what they're experiencing in the store? Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director: Yeah, Nicole. Just reviewed those numbers recently, and there's not increased turnover in any significant way. So in fact most of our turnover numbers, especially for our hourly managers and salaried managers, have been declining over the last few months and they seem to continue to. And just having spent a lot of time in the restaurants with our teams and having spoken with our executive team directors and restaurant support officers, all of us are seeing the same thing, which is that our employees are really, really enthusiastic, they're excited to be implementing these new food safety procedures, they're proud of what they're doing, they understand that these things make sense and they're doing a fantastic job. And they're keeping their heads very, very high. They're also excited now that the CDC has called this thing over and that they can begin to look forward to building the restaurants back to where they had been before and to really delighting these customers as they come in. So we're seeing that our employees are super-enthusiastic, very understanding of what we're asking them to do and very, very competent in getting it done, even though we've made quite a few changes in a pretty short period of time. So we're very, very proud of our restaurant teams. And I've received loads of emails from managers and hourly managers and crew out in the field who are just offering, hey, what else can we do, and offering words of encouragement and thanking us for the culture we've built. And so it's just, it's surprisingly and I guess sort of wonderfully optimistic, and so we're very proud of that, and we think that that's going to be a great base upon which to continue to rebuild to where we know we can be. Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just a final question. Is there any comment you would make about February and March prior-year same-store sales compares relative to January, and would you be willing to call it the weather impact in January? Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, Nicole, not in terms of specific numbers, but I will tell you of the three months last year, January was the toughest comparison, so it's nice to have that behind us. It's nice to have the CDC call their investigation over. It's nice that we're on the cusp of having a lot of marketing and PR, and this company meeting, which we think will result in a really excited and motivated group. So we've got things now on our side. It's been a tough couple of months. And so with all of that, including the weather comparisons, we're optimistic about what the next few months hold. But in terms of specific numbers, what we'll do is we'll probably continue to update on a mid-quarter basis just because things have been so volatile, and so expect some updates throughout the quarter as things unfold. Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Thanks. Appreciate it. Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director: Thanks, Nicole. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Nicole. Operator : Our next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good evening. Could you comment a little bit about that investigation? What is the nature of that, and just what are they looking for? And then separately, with regard to the direct marketing campaign, could you talk about perhaps what messages will be in there? I would assume some messages about safety, and then I would also imagine value being part of that. Thanks. Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director: Yeah, David, there's not much to say at this point about the investigation because we just don't know tremendously much about it, but basically, there is a statute in California dealing with essentially selling adulterated food or selling food that can be harmful. And because of that statute, the United States Attorney for the Central District of California has opted to undertake an investigation. And obviously, we're cooperating with that investigation and providing all the documents that they'd like to look at and I think they're just wanting to make sure that everything we did was on the up-and-up. And I think that obviously we're confident that at the close of such an investigation, that's what they found. And I'm sorry, it's a federal statute under which that investigation is taking place. Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative & Development Officer : And with regard to the direct mail \u2013 or the direct marketing campaign, there are a variety of different messages. None of them actually include messages about food safety. The messages on both the printed version of direct mail as well as the mobile direct marketing are really about taste and quality. And the messages with regard to food safety are things that we drive out through PR communications and on our owned channels like our website and the new food safety website that I said that we were launching earlier in my prepared statements. So, the direct marketing is very much about delicious and wonderful food. It's very similar to what we've done in the past in that regard. And it's proven to be very effective for us at driving traffic in the past. Now we don't know of course exactly how these incidents will impact redemption on these things, but given how successful they've been in the past, we're confident that they're going to drive substantial traffic. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Jack, you called out that 36% same-store sales decline in January, but can you provide detail on how the quarter progressed? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Well, the month, Jeff, of January, I wouldn't say there's anything meaningful within the various weeks. There were some highs that were in the high 30%s, there were some lows in the lower mid-30%s. A lot of that was driven \u2013 like the one that was in the high 30%s or even 40% was driven \u2013 well, it was during a time when the weather was really bad in the Northeast and so I'd say that was weather-driven. So there's nothing during the quarter that would say there was a progression. I would say that we kind of held in that kind of mid-30% negative range throughout most of the month if you were able to exclude the weather because we were in the press a lot. There was a high awareness a lot, and that's why we're so anxious for the CDC to call this over so we can put it behind us and we can start talking about what we've done in a productive way so we can invite customers in and put it all behind us. So there is no progression either up or down other than weather that I would point out enter January. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then just one more. In mid-November, you reopened the 43 restaurants across Oregon and Washington State. And more from a case study perspective, I'm just curious from the early marketing strategies you guys chose to pursue in those really early days, actually, so what were they and did they get customers back in the restaurants, and what lessons, if any, did you learn that you can bring with you as you move into sort of this next phase of getting these customers back in the restaurants? Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative & Development Officer : Well, there wasn't a whole lot of marketing per se that we did with regard to the initial closures. The primary effort there were letters from Steve to our customers published in newspapers across the country. We actually did that twice during the course of this. And we saw, actually, after the initial reopening of those restaurants that you mentioned and the subsequent publishing of that letter a nice recovery of our customers. Unfortunately, the nature of the E. coli outbreak was different than we expected and we saw additional cases creep in over the following weeks and subsequent eight additional announcements by the CDC of additional cases here and there. And so, that combined with the norovirus outbreak in Boston, was sufficient to cause people to have general sort of lingering doubt. And that's really where we stand now and we're seeing that subside a little bit, but a lot of our customers took a wait-and-see approach, and so to the extent we learnt anything from those is that being transparent and honest with our customers works. What we need to do, though, is make sure that they are completely confident that it's safe to eat at Chipotle, which it is, and so that's the primary effort that we're making with regard to communications right now is just for those customers who don't yet know it's safe, we're trying to make sure that they do. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : And from Morgan Stanley, we'll hear next from John Glass. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Jack, I wanted just two cost questions. One is on the G&A for 2016. I'm sorry if I missed it. Where are you pointing us toward if G&A was $250 million I think for 2015? Did you say it was $60 million higher net of anything or what is the right number, as you look at it? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : $65 million higher. Yes, John, it's going to be in dollar terms $65 million higher. And in my prepared comments, which hopefully you picked up on those, there are number of discrete things that are happening that are causing the majority of that, and when you look at the underlying non-discrete growth, the growth is relatively modest. But overall when you take into account kind of the fact that we had some pretty extraordinary performance-based adjustments in 2015, we'll have the All Managers Conference. Overall we expect to see G&A go up by $65 million. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then what is nonrecurring in the first quarter? That's a fairly significant decline. I appreciate there's a lot of things going on. How much of what you would say in the first quarter is nonrecurring in nature, consulting or whatever else? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : I don't have a great number on that, John. I'll be able to do a better job of telling you that as the quarter unfolds. I think the best thing to take into account is when I gave the various what we think the margins will be, I tried to take into account some sloppiness, either inefficiencies or some kind of one-time costs, even though it's hard to pinpoint exactly what those one-time costs are now. The biggest single impact that we're going to have on our margins is going to be sales recovery. And so if we recover say 20%, for example, we can have margins in the high-teens. In terms of the single biggest thing that's going to hit the first quarter is going to be promotion and marketing. That's going to be 6%. So 6% of sales. And that will be a lot, lot, lot higher than we spent in the past by four times in terms of percentage of sales and 3.5 times in terms of dollars that we spent last year. That's going to be the single biggest non-recurring. Other than that, there's going to be little nonrecurring things here and there that it's hard to get a handle on right now, but I'll be able to tell you guys as we close the quarter about what some of those non-recurrings are in our first quarter release. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. Question on the marketing... John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Sharon. Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: I know historically you've talked about marketing as a percent of sales, which you did today. But it's a little hard on our end \u2013 probably on your end, too \u2013 because you don't really know how the cadence of sales will progress throughout the year. So I was hoping maybe you would talk about the marketing plans in dollar terms for the first quarter and the full year? And then I'm just curious as to \u2013 I think you've said in your research the Northeast and the West Coast have been hit harder in terms of consumer response. I was wondering if you were going to disproportionately target some of the areas where you've seen more of that pushback from consumers? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Yes, Sharon, during the first quarter and during January as well, we did see the Northeast and the West Coast hit the hardest. And to give you an example, for the fourth quarter, the overall comp for the company was a negative 15%. And the Northeast and including mid-Atlantic those comps were down in the high-teens, and the rest of the country \u2013 so you're talking about the middle of the \u2013 and the West Coast as well \u2013 was down in the high-teens. The rest of the country was down more in the low-double digits. So there wasn't anybody that was down like double company average and somebody was down half. It was a relatively tight range, but there was definitely \u2013 throughout the quarter and into January \u2013 more of an impact on the West Coast and in the Northeast. In terms of Q1, just to give you a rough idea on dollar terms, Sharon, we'll spend probably around $50 million in combined marketing and promo. Now that's an estimate on the promo side, because we're guessing as to what the redemptions will be. So that number will vary depending on how many people come in and want to redeem their offer. I hope to be able to come back and tell you that that cost is a lot higher because a lot more people redeemed their offer, because that means they're willing to come back to Chipotle, they trust Chipotle, and we have a confidence level, if people will come in for the offer, that they'll come back afterwards knowing that it is safe to visit Chipotle. Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Sharon. Operator : And moving on, we'll take a question from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays. Jeff Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Two questions, just one on the sales recovery. I can appreciate when you mention it's hard to predict and you gave us good sensitivity in terms of where the margins would fall out. But how would you directionally define a successful or reasonable recovery? How do you see that playing out? Is it just time is going to heal all this and you'd expect trends to just sequentially improve every quarter through the year? Or how would you look back and say, you know what, that's what we kind of expected in terms of pace of recovery? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : You know, Jeff, it's really hard to predict. When we looked at other events, other companies that have gone through something like this, the recovery typically takes four or five quarters or so. We know that there are things that are different than what happened in previous cases. For one, we've had a couple instances here, so that kept us in the news a lot longer. Secondly, the news travels faster. There's a lot more chatter on social media, and so the word really traveled fast. Sometimes accurately, sometimes inaccurately. And so we know that there are differences that might make this a little tougher. Our main objective was to \u2013 once we had an event that signaled that this was over, and we now have that in hand \u2013 to be very aggressive to invite customers in. And we're doing that. Mark talked about that. We're spending a lot more money on marketing and promotion than we've ever had before in dollar terms and in percentage of sales terms than we ever have before. We're telling our teams to staff their restaurants as if the steep recovery is coming for sure, so that when the recovery comes, if it comes a little slower, we'll still be ready. And so our main objective is to be aggressive with bringing customers in, being ready for when they come in and we're hoping that that will accelerate the recovery. If it took four or five quarters, as it has in other instances like this, I think that would be a fair way to think about it. But we won't know until the recovery starts and then we'll share with you the cadence as it happens. Jeff Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understood. And then just your comment on there's finally some closure with the CDC signal yesterday. It sounds like there's no longer any trace of it, but it's still a struggle in terms of the certainty on the cause. So I'm just wondering with that kind of as an open-ended item, like, how do you respond or how do you advise your existing suppliers who maybe are looking for guidance on proper food safety to avoid incidences similar to this in the future? I'm guessing you would've preferred if the CDC had totally identified what the cause was. Like with this ambiguity now, how do you think about that going forward as suppliers look to make sure of their food safety measures going forward? Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer : Well, so because we don't identify the item that caused the E. coli, we have gone to all of our suppliers, especially the suppliers that have high-risk items, meats and produce, and have implemented high-resolution testing as laid out by Dr. Samadpour, who we brought on board right after the outbreak. He is very familiar with these types of cases and has put in an extraordinary testing procedure. So we test a lot of our high-risk items. Those items that can't be tested, like whole avocados, whole onions, things that we bring into our restaurant, we've put in place a blanching procedure which actually is boiling these items in water for a brief period of time, five seconds, which destroys any microbe that might be on the surface. So even though we haven't identified the specific item, all of our items now that are high risk go through either this testing or this blanching kill step. And we think now Chipotle is much safer than it's ever been, and this really puts us in a position to be industry leaders in terms of food safety. Jeff Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understood. Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Jeff. Operator : And we do have time for one additional question today, and that will come from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good afternoon. My question's on the unit growth outlook. And this year, no change in the outlook, I assume, because your pipeline was fully set. But I guess the big picture question is, why not slow down a little bit while you're getting your arms around some of the food safety issues, and perhaps defer some of the openings so that you can make sure the quality of the existing unit execution is good versus continuing to charge ahead on the unit openings? Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Great question, David. I would say, first of all, though, that we have implemented this extraordinary food safety program. And that is up and running and the teams are executing it very, very well. We expect that we're going to bring our customers back. And we would not want to be in a position where we slow the pipeline for 2017 finding that our sales have recovered and then not have the opportunity to satisfy the demand as we have had in years past. So we feel it's prudent to stay on course with our existing plans of expansion. Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director: Also, David, right now we have the very best ratio of field leaders to restaurant managers and restaurants that we've had for quite some time. So we have the leadership. We have the managers to run these restaurants really, really, really, really well. And so our real estate people are out filling that pipeline, doing a great job finding real estate. We have the managers to run those restaurants. And if we thought that slowing down growth would help us to implement the food safety procedures that we have implemented, we would do so. But the reality is, we have a lot of confidence that that implementation has gone really well and will continue to go really well over the coming months. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Hey, David. This is Jack. Just to add something to that. What you're talking about here is execution risk. Are we taking additional execution risk by opening up stores while implementing these procedures? A lot of the procedures are not happening in the restaurant, meaning the testing is happening outside the restaurant. So a lot of this food safety program is designed to prevent anything unwanted from ever getting into the restaurant. We're doing that by testing or we're doing that by doing some of the washing and some of the prep in a central kitchen, so it's guaranteed that nothing will get into the restaurant. And then the procedures that are in the restaurant, they're not subtle in terms of whether they are done or not. What Steve talked about with blanching, if you blanche for just a matter of a couple seconds in boiling water, it's an instant kill step. So it's not like you're relying on some kind of complex procedure or new process in the restaurant. It's a very clear step that, when followed, it is going to make each ingredient absolutely safe. And so the execution risk in terms of opening up new restaurants is very, very low. If there was execution risk, we absolutely would do something to make sure we would reduce that execution risk. But we feel really good about the way the teams are handling all these procedures so far. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Very helpful. Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, David. Operator : And that will conclude the Q&A session for today. I will turn it back over to our speakers for additional and closing remarks. Mark Alexee - Manager, Investor Relations : Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. We will be participating in the Bank of America Consumer Tech Conference in mid-March in New York, and then we anticipate speaking with you next during our first quarter conference call on April 26. Thank you so much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference. Again, we thank you all for joining us.",

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve. Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon, everybody. Chipotle has always been a company that is focused on a long-term vision to change the way people think about and eat fast food. As we move forward, we believe it is critical that we continue to focus on the things that have driven our success for so many years, our unique food culture and our unique people culture. It's been our focus on these key drivers of our business that has differentiated Chipotle in a crowded and competitive field and it has allowed us to develop a strong loyalty among our customers. These key attributes are what has served us \u2013 what has allowed us to serve delicious food and to provide outstanding customer service. Never has it been more important for us to delight our customers on each and every visit and we have great confidence in our managers and crews to remain focused and to provide the extraordinary customer experience our customers expect from us. We're also encouraged by the long-term opportunity that still exists for Chipotle both in terms of adding new restaurants and attracting customers who have never tried our restaurants. In each of these ways, there is still so much untapped growth potential for Chipotle, and as we continue our efforts to restore lost sales tied to last year's food safety issues, there is significant opportunity for us to continue to grow our business by attracting new customers and opening new restaurants. We begin to see sales recover in the second half of the first quarter as our transaction trends reversed course from the lows we saw in January. Since the beginning of February, we have seen an 18-point improvement in comp transactions compared to the full month of January. We have worked to invite our customers back by reminding them of the things they loved about Chipotle, such as our delicious food, our high-quality ingredients and being treated to a friendly, fast experience inside of our restaurants. While we have used promotional programs to entice many of our customers to return, we are encouraged to see signs that the promotional traffic has translated into repeat paying customers. Return of customers to our restaurants improved our same-store sales comps by 11% from January to recent levels. Of course, we would like to see our sales recover more quickly but we remain confident in our long-term strategy to welcome customers back into our restaurants. Right after the food safety issues we encountered last year, we took several bold steps to ensure our food was as safe as it could possibly be. That included a systematic evaluation of each ingredient and the implementation of interventions to make them safer. Some changes were made at the suppliers and others were made in the restaurants. Since all of the initial changes were implemented, we have continued to evaluate and refine each procedure. Some of the procedures like blanching many of our produce items in the restaurant have proven to be very effective and our crews are doing a great job at executing these new procedures. In fact, we were able to add bell peppers to the blanching program which meant that we are once again able to slice the bell peppers in our restaurant rather than at a central kitchen. We have also refined the way we are washing lettuce which will once again allow us to cut lettuce in our restaurants while still ensuring that it is safe. We're also continuing to refine many of the other procedures in ways that maximize safety while simultaneously making our food taste better. During the quarter, we hired Dr. Jim Marsden as our Executive Director of Food Safety. Jim has been a tremendous asset as we continue to evaluate all of our safety protocols. Jim was previously a member of the faculty at Kansas State University in their Animal Science and Industry Department. He is working with a number of experts that have advised us in the past and has also worked closely with the U.S. CDC and FDA and other food safety authorities as we continue to implement our industry-leading protocols. Jim's expertise and viewpoint has had a significant impact in a short period of time and we continue to look forward to his leadership in furthering our food safety program. We recognize that it will take us some time to rebuild trust with our customers and to fully recover from the issues we faced late last year. And while we are encouraged that the recovery is underway, we know that there's still a lot more work to be done. We will continue to make it our top priority to entice customers to return to Chipotle through effective promotions and marketing, and when they do return, we're committed to providing the very best experience that we can to help ensure that they will keep coming back. We know that the very best marketing we can do is to provide an exceptional restaurant experience and our managers and crews are working hard to make sure they are doing just that. I'll now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative & Development Officer : Thank you, Steve. On November 1, we began conducting additional daily consumer research to help us measure and track consumer perceptions of our brand in the wake of the issues we saw last year. Key measures including admiration, consideration, first-time visits and food quality are all continuing to improve. In some cases, consumer perception in these key areas has returned to levels close to what it was prior to Q4 of last year. For others, we still need to see additional improvements but the trends continue to be promising. In early February, we launched an aggressive marketing campaign designed to drive customers back into our restaurants. This campaign consisted of mobile and direct mail promotions, a nationwide advertising campaign and a variety of social, mobile and local marketing activities. The campaign began with the Raincheck mobile promotion distributed on the day of our companywide meeting on February 8. As you may recall, this was the day we closed all of our restaurants for a national all-company meeting and when we provided the opportunity for customers to get a free meal through our mobile offer. In all, we issued well over 5 million free burrito offers and saw an extraordinary redemption rate of 67%. We followed the mobile offer with a direct mail promotion to about 20 million households and we currently have a 17.5% average redemption rate which we expect to approach 20% as the redemption window closes. For those customers that had previously responded to direct mail, we are seeing a redemption rate of an impressive 44% and growing. We are currently in the midst of our nationwide advertising campaign that runs through the end of June. This advertising campaign is the largest media spend in our history and is targeting all of our U.S. and Canadian locations. The creative features delicious food and reinforces our commitment to responsibly raised ingredients cooked using classic cooking techniques and without the use of artificial flavors, colors or sweeteners. Our research shows that this campaign is performing particularly well with new customers. In the coming months, we also plan to return to using nontraditional marketing that differentiates the Chipotle brand. This will include a short film and promotional game as well as other content-driven marketing programs. These upcoming marketing efforts will combine differentiating messages about Chipotle with traffic driving components. Throughout the year, we will continue to be more aggressive than usual with our marketing and we are considering two programs aimed at driving traffic among our loyal customers and lapsed customers or our customers \u2013 our lapsed customers or that is customers who have not been to Chipotle in three months or more. For example, we are exploring a limited time frequency incentive designed to reward our most loyal customers for eating frequently at Chipotle this summer. Additionally, we are considering adding menu items that will appeal to our loyal or lapsed customers. Over the years, we have tested additions to the menu that have proven to be very popular with our most frequent customers. While we didn't make these menu items permanent additions to the menu, at the time we do see an opportunity to introduce these or other items as a way of inviting our loyal customers back into our restaurants. I'd also like to discuss the progress we're making in strengthening our digital ordering capabilities. We have completed the integration between Postmates, our largest delivery partner and our back-of-house ordering system. This allows Postmates to send orders directly to our back-of-house make line instead of standing in line to order. We've completed this initial integration with Postmates and we are currently using this new system at restaurants in San Francisco and Atlanta and will be rolling it out in all of our markets in the coming months. We're also in the process of creating the same capability with our other delivery partners. Next, we are testing a system that allows for smarter pickup times for customers who place online and mobile orders. This system is designed to reduce the time between order placements and pickup. The system dynamically monitors the flow of orders into our restaurants and gives our customers the shortest possible order completion time while simultaneously ensuring that the restaurants will complete the orders on time. This system is currently being tested in one of our markets prior to being rolled out nationwide. Finally, we issued updated versions of our iOS and Android ordering apps that make it easier for customers to pay using their credit or debit card that speed up the payment process and that streamline reordering for our frequent customers. While it is early in our sales recovery process, we are encouraged by improving trends in customer sentiment and by customer response to our marketing and promotional efforts. We expect that we will see continued progress in these areas going forward as customers regain confidence in us and remember what it is that they always loved about Chipotle. I'll now turn the call over to Monty. Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director: Thank you, Mark. At the heart of our efforts to ensure the very best experience we can for each and every customer, our teams have top-performing restaurant employees, managers and field leaders. The strength of our teams has always been an advantage for us because these teams truly believe in our mission and treat our guests to a unique and genuine customer experience. As we continue to rebuild trust with our customers by serving safe and delicious food and as we continue to invite them back into our restaurants with our marketing and promotional programs, our restaurant teams are ready to provide the type of experience that will keep our customers coming back. I'm proud of how our teams are responding in this challenging recovery effort. They have quickly and efficiently implemented many changes in our restaurants over the last few months and simultaneously continue to provide a terrific experience. I'm incredibly warmed by the level of commitment and pride our teams have demonstrated during a difficult time, and I am more confident than ever that they are the ones who will ensure that we fulfill our mission. Additionally, we are seeing the impact of stronger mid-level leadership through our improved rate of restaurateur promotion this year compared with last year. Through the first quarter of 2016, we promoted 61 restaurateurs, an increase of 45% over the same time last year, despite having even higher standards for the attainment of this elite position. We continue to refine the restaurateur program, and while our restaurateur candidates have always been required to show demonstrable success in building restaurateur cultures, delivering excellent hospitality and ensuring a strong business model, we now have even more strict standards in all of those categories. Today, before a restaurateur can be selected, they must have excellent scores on our internal and external third-party audits related to food safety, and we continue to require more accountability for maintaining a disciplined business culture including assessments of sales projections, throughput, scheduling and labor management, food orders and other management and key expenses. This business culture review is in addition to developing an amazing people culture, perhaps the most challenging aspect of being a restaurateur. So with better tools and established field leaders, our pipeline of general managers continues to grow. To continue to emphasize the development of our restaurateur culture during difficult times is critical. They are the ones who can most skillfully create excellent, safe and delicious restaurant experiences while developing the future leaders we needed to grow our business effectively. As we entice customers to return to our restaurants with more aggressive marketing and promotions, it is doubly important that we remind them what makes a meal at Chipotle so special by greeting them enthusiastically, having friendly and efficient service, great throughput and by making them a delicious meal. And the teams that are most able to do all these things well are our restaurateur teams who provide these great operations while ensuring a strong business model as well. And as more restaurateurs are stepping up, our best field leaders have been able to spend more time in our newer restaurants, or restaurants that have the opportunity to perform much, much better. With more field leaders in our system than in recent years, our restaurants are getting more one-on-one attention and leadership than before, and that will help to build more of these elite restaurateur cultures. In addition to the accelerated pace of these promotions during the quarter, we also promoted 63 existing restaurateurs into multi-unit positions, and strengthened our ranks by promoting 24 additional field leaders. This continued investment in our restaurateur and field leadership program is paying off in a better customer experience. One example is the impact we've had on our throughput initiative. Our field leaders are working hard to set each restaurant up for success, and that starts by effectively implanting the four pillars of throughput. When we have the four pillars in place, our restaurants are poised to engage with our customers and show our gratitude by serving them quickly on each and every visit. Our restaurants are prepared, organized and ready for the day with proper mise en place. All hands are on deck with aces in their places, and with a dedicated linebacker that is in constant communication with the back of the house. And we can pull customers through the line faster with a dedicated expediter at the cashier. Incorporating the four pillars affects nearly every aspect of the guest experience. Of course, building great teams and great cultures in our restaurant starts with the people we hire and with our ability to retain and develop our top performers. That's always the case, but more so in a tightening labor market. We know that if our employees feel cared for and are given proper training such that they feel confident in their ability and encouraged by their circumstances, we have a much better chance of having them stay with us and develop careers at Chipotle. We are emphasizing this more with our restaurant managers and teams starting with the need to hire only crew-members who have the 13 characteristics. The qualities we believe make it more likely that a newly hired employee will become a top performer at Chipotle. We are also reiterating to our restaurants the need to involve crew in the interview process and hiring decisions for new crew. This helps us ensure that the people we are hiring in our restaurants are a good fit, and it demonstrates the importance of each and every employee we add to our teams. Developing future teams and promoting from within is extremely important to us particularly as we continue to bring Chipotle to more locations across the United States. During the quarter, we opened 58 new restaurants and for 2016 we plan to open 220 to 235 new restaurants. Looking beyond this year, there is still significant opportunity for us to continue to open new restaurants at a healthy pace. We will continue to balance the opportunity for further growth with a disciplined approach to development to ensure that we are opening up new restaurants in great locations with strong economics and staffed with top-performing teams. As many of you have experienced firsthand, our restaurants are feeling busy again. Relative to December and January, they have more energy, more customers and enthusiastic teams ready to greet them. Our food tastes great and we are continuing to emphasize customer service and hospitality as we make headway in increasing our sales. That said, it's more critical now than ever that every restaurant delivers on the high standards that we have set for Chipotle. We have the utmost confidence in our crews, managers and restaurateurs, as well as our field leadership to continue to improve upon these qualities that make Chipotle great. I'll now turn the call over to Jack. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Monty. We invested aggressively during the first quarter to encourage our customers to return to Chipotle. Our customers redeemed over 6 million free burritos or bowls during February and March. And we also gave away nearly 1 million free orders of chips and salsa or chips and guac. The goal is to invite our customers back into Chipotle with a compelling offer, treat them to a delicious meal and an energetic environment with the hope that they will begin to return to their normal frequency of visiting Chipotle. The response to the offers was strong especially right after our all-company meeting on February 8 with redemptions reaching a high of nearly $500,000 in a single day just a few days after the offer began. Comp transactions improved from down 34% for the full month of January to a high point of down only 9% during the third week of February. Of course, it's not surprising that free offers spur immediate action by our customers, but more importantly, as the number of redemptions leveled off, we saw our paying customers steadily increase. And by the first week of March when redemptions were down to under $100,000 per day, our comp transactions were down only 14% and comp sales were down 22%. We felt the recovery was off to a respectable start just three weeks or four weeks into our marketing campaign. As Steve mentioned, we implemented a number of new procedures and protocols to establish Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety. Some of these protocols are put to the test in Boston last month and we had four employees who were at home sick and fully followed our protocols by not coming to work. We temporarily closed the restaurant and local health officials commended us for the successful design and execution of our protocols which resulted in our restaurant remaining safe for our customers. Unfortunately, some stores refer to this as another outbreak and those headlines interrupted our sales recovery. This was a disappointing setback which caused our nationwide comp sales to worsen to around negative 27% for a few weeks before recovering to the low to mid negative 20%s in late March. For all of March, comps TCs were down 15.6% and comp sales were down 26.4% with Easter negatively impacting both by about 2.5% as we lost one trading day in the month. The impact of the headlines concerning Boston taught us that the recovery can be fragile and that we need to rebuild trust with our customers \u2013 every single customer, every single day in every single restaurant. Average daily sales increased sequentially in April versus late March by about 3% to 4% with the comp sales run rate excluding the benefit of Easter was right around negative 26% in April so far because seasonality typically has resulted in about the 6% to 7% increase in April sales over March. Including the benefit of Easter, comp sales were around negative 22% for the first three weeks in April and comp transactions are around negative 16%. Easter added about 4% to both the sales and transaction comps so far. Now, some of this lag in April sales are due to cold, wet weather in some areas of the country early in the month and we did see the comp for a few days improve to the low negative 20%s during the past week, so we're hoping we will still get that seasonality step up we normally see this time of year but just a few weeks later. The sales recovery has been uneven throughout the country. For the first three weeks of April, our traffic comps excluding the Easter benefit were negative 15% in the middle of the country, the Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic, whereas they were down 20% companywide again excluding the benefit of Easter. That's about a 16-point recovery as compared to January which means we recovered about half the lost visits in these areas. But on the West Coast and the Northeast, the two areas closest to the outbreaks of late 2015, our traffic comps have recently been trending at negative 24%, again excluding the Easter benefit compared to negative 37% in January. So we've only recovered about a third of customer visits in these areas. For the first quarter, our sales were $834.5 million and our restaurant level operating margins were 6.8% for the quarter. As expected, the largest driver of the year-over-year decrease in margin was sales deleverage which accounted for more than half of our drop in margins compared to 2015. There's also an impact of nearly 600 basis points of what we would consider to be nonrecurring expenses including an elevated promotional and marketing investment that totaled 660 basis points, which is over 500 basis points higher than last year. Food cost is higher than Q4 2015 by 150 basis points and we expect that food costs will remain at about this level for the rest of the year. While it's difficult to provide meaningful projections for either sales comps or margins in the coming quarters especially given the sales volatility I just described, I can tell you that the approximate margin level to expect at various sales levels. For example, with comps at the current level our average unit restaurant volumes are about $1.9 million on an annual basis, and our restaurant level margins should improve to the low double digits in the next few quarters as the nonrecurring costs begin to level off. If comps are around negative 20%, AUVs would be about $2 million and margins would be around the mid to high-teens. If comps recovered around negative 10%, AUVs would be about $2.2 million and our margins should be in the low 20%s. And if we fully recover our sales with AUVs in the $2.4 million to $2.5 million range, we would expect margins in the mid-20% range which accounts for the recurring cost of new procedures and protocols that relate to food safety. Labor costs for the quarter were 30.9% of sales or an increase of 850 basis points compared to last year. More than 600 basis points of the change was driven by sales deleverage (23:27), while we also had nearly 100 basis points tied to nonrecurring expenses as we incurred additional labor in early February and March to support our promotional strategy and also our national team meeting on February 8 when about 50,000 employees attended. We also continue to incur higher labor costs related to our merit increases taken in mid-2015 for restaurant crew and managers which averaged about 7% along with increased benefits including increased vacation days, paid sick leave and tuition reimbursement, all of which added about 160 basis points to labor. Our promotional and marketing expenses during the quarter totaled $55 million or about 6.6% of sales and this included $4 million or about 50 basis points related to promo offers that were issued in the first quarter, but they're expected to be redeemed in the second quarter. We'll continue to invest in recovering our customers and promos will be an important part of the strategy, but we expect combined marketing and promo to level off to about 3% to 4% as a percentage of sales over the next few quarters. While this is lower than Q1, it's nearly double what we spent as a percent of sales in Q2 and Q3 of last year. We'll invest in more traditional brand advertising and return to talking about our delicious food made from high quality ingredients. G&A for the first quarter was $62 million or 7.4% of sales, down $1 million from last year. Total stock-based comp included in G&A was $7.5 million which is down about $7.6 million from last year. Offsetting that reduction were higher legal costs and the cost of the all-company meeting which combined added $4 million to G&A. For the full year 2016, we anticipate total stock-based compensation in G&A to be about $60 million and for the full year 2016, G&A will total just over $300 million or about $50 million higher than last year as we add support for our new restaurant openings and as we will hold our biennial all-manager conference in September. Our effective tax rate benefit for the quarter was 40.6% and was impacted by nonrecurring adjustments related to state income taxes for prior years. Our effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be 38.4%. During the first quarter, we reported a loss of $26.4 million or a diluted loss per share of $0.88. Our cash and investments totaled $706 million as of March 31 and we continue to be very aggressive with our balance sheet to repurchase stock. We repurchased a total of $645 million from January 1 through yesterday at an average price of $463 per share. Since November 1, 2015, we've repurchased a total of $956 million of our stock, representing a reduction of nearly 2 million shares outstanding and we have $71.4 million left in our current authorization to purchase stock. As we work through this sales recovery, we will remain disciplined in restoring our unit economics to deliver attractive margins and returns and restore our ability to create significant shareholder value over the long-term. Thanks for your time today. And we'd be happy to open the line for any questions you may have. Operator : At this time, we'll take a question from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. If I could, just two. One is, first, can you just talk about currently what portion of your sales are on coupons? I think you've talked about that in the past with the rate of \u2013 how reliant are you currently on coupon redemptions? What portion of sales, and how have those trended over like the last four weeks as you've sort of moved away from some of the initial drops? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, John, it's dropped off a lot. If you look at the difference between during April between our sales and our transactions which is about a 4% to 5% difference; that would account for the people that are coming in and have a coupon and are not \u2013 basically it's reducing our average check. So I would call it in that 4% to 5% range. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: 4% to 5% of transactions or of your total comp are coming from that? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Well, there's a gap between the comp sales and the comp transactions and that gap is all driven by a lower average check and most of that gap is driven by the promotions. So part of it is driven by a lower check size but the largest part of it is driven by the promotions. So I'd say the promotions are in that kind of the 4% range in terms of sales. Those are sales, John. Had they been coming in and full paying customers, there would be virtually no gap between our transactions and sales. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got you. And I know you gave some scenarios around where store margins would be at various comp levels. Can you talk more specifically about the second quarter specifically? And knowing now a little bit more specifically about the promotional activity you're doing and the expense related to it, do you have a sense of where second quarter earnings comes out based on all of that? I understand there's some comp sensitivity, but is there anything specifically to call out in terms of the cost structure in the second quarter versus the first quarter? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : John, I hesitate. The first quarter we gave a figure, we said we were going to lose $1, and that's because we knew we had a lot of one-time things. We were implementing our food safety protocol. We're not prepared \u2013 I'm not prepared to guess what the EPS is going to be in the second quarter. It all depends on sales. So if sales recover, the EPS will turn positive very quickly, and we'll have a reasonably healthy EPS. But if they stay at this level, it's going to be hard to deliver the higher margins. It's going to be hard to deliver the EPS. So we're not going to give an EPS projection at this time. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got you. Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go to Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon M. Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. I guess a couple of questions for Mark. I think you mentioned in your prepared commentary that some perception areas with consumers are lagging. And I wonder if you could talk about what the laggers are and how you're going to address those? And then secondarily, when you talk about your most loyal and most frequent customers, can you define how you characterize those? Are those folks who come in once a week? Just any kind of parameters around that. And then it sounds like they have been lagging maybe more than the less frequent customers. If you could give some color around that, that would be helpful. Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative & Development Officer : Sure. With regard to the brand attributes, they're all actually looking pretty good, but I'll give you a few examples. Aided consideration, so obviously when we give people a list of restaurants including our brand, and ask them how likely they are to visit, before the food safety issues that hovered around 50%, right now that's recovered to 43%. So we're down 7% on that one, but it's picking up at a consistent rate. Admiration before these incidents was 70%, now it's at 61%. So again, recovering from down into the 50% area. So a lot of the stuff has come back up nicely. The way we measure new customers, of course, are the people who visited for the first time within the last three months. That's actually recovered almost \u2013 it's just two points below what it was before this, so that's really good news. On the customers who are lapsed, we look at people who haven't been in three months or more. And that was \u2013 you want a lower number there, that was 49% before and now that's at 57%. So that one's probably got the biggest delta there. But for example, on another attribute which is we serve healthy, fresh, unprocessed food, that's recovered to exactly the same levels as it was before. So it's a mixed bag. I don't know that any of them are problematic such that I don't think we're going to be able to recover them, because we're seeing just nice trends all across the board on those. In terms of your question about frequency, we break our customers into five groups by frequency. We call our most frequent customers top loyal, they come 25 times or more a year. The next group are heavy customers, they come 13 times to 24 times, then medium which is 6 times to 12 times, light is 2 times to 5 times and a new or lapsed customer is one-time. And you're correct in that we saw larger declines in both new in the two \u2013 the top and bottom categories. So these are single-digit drops, but in new and lapsed, and in top loyal. And so a lot of what we're looking at from a marketing perspective is bringing in those top loyal \u2013 that single-digit drop in top loyal customers that we saw. And I'm not suggesting that these customers left altogether, but their frequency may have declined. So some of what I mentioned in my prepared remarks are aimed at either giving them a reason to come back in and that might be a new menu item. Or some sort of a frequency incentive which I also mentioned which would be coming in a certain number of times over a period of time, and we will give you something. So those are both efforts designed to target that group of customers. Operator : This time, we'll move to Joshua Long with Piper Jaffray. Joshua C. Long - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Great. Thank you. So I wanted to see if you could provide some commentary on how you're thinking about balancing the aggressive advertising and traffic driving initiatives here over the near-term with maybe balancing the longer-term value or consumer perception over the longer term. Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative & Development Officer : Well, we are transitioning first from free to buy one, get ones and other types of promotions which typically have a purchase associated with them as a transitional step away from being entirely dependent on free food. So that's part of it. But as I mentioned also in my prepared comments, we're getting back into the type of advertising or marketing that's been so successful for us in the past, which is some of this brand marketing which is based on short films and other types of content which really deliver messages about the brand and continue to differentiate Chipotle from the competition. One of the good \u2013 one of the really good pieces of news in our research is that the differentiation of Chipotle from our competitors really has not suffered, or to the extent that it did, it recovered fully. And so we're going to continue to push the messages about our 65 ingredients and how simple they are and our simple, classic cooking techniques and how different that is from the competition whose food is \u2013 tends to be heavily processed and include hundreds and hundreds of ingredients, many of which are processed. So we're definitely getting back on that, and July is when we'll really be in full swing with that type of marketing again. So we're transitioning back. But as I say that, there's going to be always a promotional element with those until we really fully recover our sales. Joshua C. Long - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Understood. And then as we think about your discussion about bringing new menu items in, should we be thinking about those as LTOs here over the near term, or perhaps permanent menu additions? And how do you think about balancing the maybe added complexity of new menu items which you haven't done or haven't been as big a part of the story historically with your focus on really driving operational efficiency here over the near term? Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative & Development Officer : Okay. Well, I'll speak to the \u2013 whether or not or how this might unfold, then I'll let Steve talk to the nature of the operational impact to us. But right now, I wouldn't say whether or not \u2013 I don't think we know whether or not these things would be permanent, but there's no reason why they wouldn't be. The item that we're considering introducing first is chorizo, which is something we've done before. We did it in Kansas City last year, and we were prepared to expand that to a second market right as we came into this food-borne illness situation and we tabled it so that we could put all of our focus on correcting the problem. But we did find that that was very, very popular with our loyal customers. In fact, for a lot of people who tried it, it quickly became their most favorite protein. And so it'll be very helpful for us from a marketing perspective to bring those customers back in and make our loyal customers come more often. So I think it's a \u2013 it's yet to be seen whether that means it will become permanent, but we'll try it out and see how it goes. Steve can talk to the nature of that and how that works within the Chipotle environment. Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer : Sure, Mark. Josh, thanks for the question. So this chorizo that Mark speaks of is really delicious. It's a chicken and pork spicy sausage. We cook this on our plancha. It has lots of little crispy bits, so it has nice spice and really good texture, and as Mark said, very, very popular with the customers that had it in a couple of our test markets. When we think about adding something to Chipotle, we're very, very mindful of our overall efficiencies, efficiencies in the kitchen, efficiencies in cook time, efficiencies in throughput and ease of ordering for the customer. Chorizo fits into this system really, really well in that we have space for it on the main line and it doesn't detract from throughput. It's also very easy to rotate on to the plancha to grill between chicken and steak. The cook time and the method of grilling isn't much different from the chicken and steak already on the plancha. So operationally, I would say it's quite easy to execute. But I think it's very exciting in that it does add a new flavor and texture to the meat offerings. And it pairs well with our existing offerings, our salsas and guacamole and cheese and what have you. So again, very popular and I'm excited to see how this works. Joshua C. Long - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Great. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : We'll move to John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Two questions, if I may. Firstly, with some of the food safety changes that you've made, the sous vide of the steak, blanching a variety of vegetables and precutting lettuce, have all of those changes been met with positive customer response? In other words, do the customers like the food as much or better than they did before with the operational changes that you found yourself to make? Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director: Yeah. I think, generally, the changes have gone very, very well. I won't say all of them have been met with immediate approval. And an example of that is we went over to a lettuce that was pre-shredded at a central kitchen in order to be able to be absolutely certain of the \u2013 that all the interventions were in place to make sure that that was food safe. And that lettuce, I think, people found to be a degradation in quality of the stuff that was cut in the restaurants by our teams who \u2013 when our restaurant teams do it, they're able to cut it to the exact size they want, they're able to really make sure that the presentation is exactly what they want and that they can assure the quality of the lettuce. This was a product which is really just completely prepared in a central kitchen. So what we've been able to do and what we'll be rolling out soon, we've been able to find a way to have this made completely safe by interventions in a central kitchen but yet still have the entire head of lettuce brought to the restaurant and yet and give our crews in the restaurant the latitude to be able to cut that properly and assure the quality of that again. So we've just been tasting that the last few days in a few of our restaurants here in Denver, and it's delicious. It's wonderful, and so we're going to be moving back to a lettuce that I think everyone else is very satisfied with. The rest of the changes have been met very positively. The sous viding of the steak is delicious. We've actually had a reduction in the number of customer complaints. With steak, there's always been over time some complaints because steak contains naturally some chewy bits and whatnot because we use real steak. And with the sous vide, the technique has allowed us to break down some of those aspects of the steak through kind of a long breathing process in the sous vide process which makes the steak juicier and more tender and more delicious. So actually we're very, very pleased with how that's going and our customers seemed to be very pleased as well. The blanching of the ingredients has had \u2013 essentially it's had no effect whatsoever on the eating quality of the ingredients, but it's a wonderful step to ensure, again, food safety and the elimination of potential harmful pathogens or what have you. So our crews in the restaurants have done an awesome job implementing that new procedure and have found it quite easy and they're very proud of it because it makes them \u2013 it gives them even higher level of confidence in the food we're serving. And again, no degradation whatsoever in what our customers are receiving. So we are feeling really, really good about the quality of our food in the restaurants. I think it is actually better than ever, I think, subject to that one change in lettuce. We thought that the bell peppers we were bringing in pre-sliced from a central kitchen were good, but maybe not quite as good as the ones cut in our restaurants. So what we've been able to do is go back to blanching the bell peppers such that they can be cut by a knife by the skilled hands of our folks in the restaurant and again, have brought that back to the level of quality it was before but again with the blanching to assure food safety of that ingredient. So we're very proud of everything we've done. We think that the intent focus on our food that's been caused by looking at every single ingredient, it's caused our teams in the restaurants to also look at every single ingredient very, very critically and make certain that everything is as good as it can be. So I think our food is more delicious than ever. With that one sort of asterisk that the lettuce was I think not as good for a time but we're returning that to where it was and I think that we're very, very proud of where our food stands now. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And, Monty, you made a comment in your prepared remarks and it was interesting how you said it, talking about the unit development in 2016, and basically saying, beyond this year, continued to grow at a healthy pace. And I think you used the word disciplined pace around location, returns and staffing. I'm sorry I don't have the transcript in front of me. But it seems like you may be kind of preparing us for a slowdown or a leveling off of development from 2016 into the outer years. So I just wanted to see perhaps what you meant by those comments. Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director: Yeah, yeah. Thanks for asking. I think that the short answer is no. We're not preparing for a slowdown of our development and I think you'll find that we will be able to achieve very easily the guidance that we've given in terms of number of restaurant openings. But we do have a very strong pipeline coming in from our real estate teams who have been doing an excellent job finding a lot of terrific sites. But the reason for my comments was that as we've had a slowdown of sales overall that you're all aware of, and the numbers that Jack spoke about with a slowdown of nationwide sales as a result of what happened in late 2015. So too has that slowdown affected our new store openings. But it's not \u2013 it's affected them disproportionately. What I mean is that most of our new restaurant openings have still held the same percentage that they historically have held versus our trailing 12-month sales of all our existing stores. But the exception is that in the new markets and developing markets, in those markets there's been, I think, even more softening of their sales than there has been nationally, say. So the delta between a new store opening in a developing or new market has been slightly greater than when compared to the rest of our restaurant average daily sales. So the delta of new and developing markets is a little bit bigger than the delta between proven and established markets. And so that percentage of all of our new store openings though is quite low. It's about 13% of our new store openings are in new markets or developing markets. And because those sales have been correspondingly a little more soft than the rest of openings, we're going to be taking just a much closer look at those, and be more nitpicking as to which ones we do deals on. So it's going to be a very slight effect in terms of number of openings, and we have such a strong pipeline that we don't think it's going to affect the overall numbers that we've shared with you that we plan to open. But it's going to give us, I think, the ability to be a little bit more discerning on a few of our locations, and just make sure that any ones for which the development cost is perhaps a little bit high, or the rent structure isn't quite advantageous, we might walk away from some of those deals that we might have pursued a year ago today, for example, just to be responsible with our investments. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director: Thank you. Operator : We'll go to a question from Jason West with Credit Suisse. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah, thanks. Jack, just wanted to come back to the guidance that you talked about on the promo and marketing expense going forward. You said you want to get that down to 3% to 4% of sales, I think, over the next few quarters. I believe it was over 6% in the first quarter. So, are you guiding us to promo marketing in sort of 2Q, 3Q in the 5%-ish type range, or is it not going to be that much of an impact? If you could help us there, it'd be great. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. No, I'd mentioned it'd be in the 3% to 4% range. Now, keep in mind our sales during the second and third quarters are higher. So you're talking about a 3% to 4% figure on top of higher sales. So it'll be meaningfully reduced, and what you'll see is the reduction is going to be in the promo. We hit promo, as you know, very, very heavy. We gave away about 6 million entr\u00e9es during the first quarter and we did that intentionally. We wanted to hit that really hard, we wanted to signal that the event was over. We signaled that within a week or two after the CDC called their investigation over, and so we did that intentionally. Going forward, as Mark mentioned, we're going to be transitioning to more BOGOs, which have a lesser impact on our promo line. Offsetting that, we're actually going to spend more on advertising during the second quarter for sure, probably third quarter. But overall, I would expect that to be in the 3% to 4% range. Now, that's still higher than historical, because if you look at second quarter and third quarter of last year, I think, that's right around double or a little more than double what we did as a percentage of sales last year. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And is that number still though TBD, depending on the sales that you're seeing? So if your comps are not progressively improving, is that a number you're going to come back and revisit, or do you guys feel like that's the type of number that's really going to get the sales going? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : No, listen, we're not locked to a number at all. That just happens to be the number based on the next wave of the strategy. We're moving into more brand advertising, moving into more of the BOGOs. That just happens to be the number. We're prepared to do what we need to do to continue to invite customers in, to continue to give them a great experience. And so if we needed to invest more, if we thought that would be a good investment, we would certainly make it. But right now, we're thinking it's going to be in that 3% to 4% range. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And, Mark, can you just explain a little bit on the loyalty piece that you mentioned how that's going to work and is that a temporary program or not? Mark Crumpacker - Chief Creative & Development Officer : Yeah. I don't have enough details to tell you exactly how it's going to work right now, but it is a temporary program. What we've seen and I mentioned earlier is that there's been a slight decline with our most loyal customers in the number of times they actually visit Chipotle per week. And so we would love to get that, have it back up, and so this was a way and we've got a couple of different technological ways of doing it. So I don't really want to go into those because I'm not sure which ones or if either will prove to be completely viable. But we do believe it's beneficial to us to get people back into the habit of visiting Chipotle at a frequency level that they enjoyed prior to the issue. So it would be something that we would do through the summer and perhaps into the fall but not something that would become permanent. There is, of course, always the possibility that we would create some sort of a permanent program, but that would take more time and planning, and so this is a temporary one for now. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. Operator : The final question today is from Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Jack, I just wanted to better understand or confirm some of the numbers you discussed today. So I think you said that April same-store sales, at least to date, are down 22%, but that included the benefit of an Easter shift. And had we excluded that benefit from the Easter shift, it would've been down about 26%? Is that correct? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : That's correct. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. So I guess then the question becomes so that down 26% sounds like it's essentially in line or even a modest sequential acceleration of same-store sales decline from what you were seeing at the end of March. If that is the case, how do you explain that? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, Jeff, it is because we saw early March was down 22%, then we have the news coming out of Boston, our sales spiked up to \u2013 or spiked down to a down 27% for a couple of weeks near the end of the month, and you've got a lot of choppiness with Easter this year at the end of March, and then you compare it to Easter last year in early April. But we are starting to see recovery back into that low to mid-20% range at the end of March. Our sales dollars, we moved from the end of March to April, got better. They improved by in that 3% to 4% range, but we're comparing to seasonal sales that in the past and last year kind of followed the pattern of increasing more like 6% to 7% range. So our dollars moved up just from March to April from late March which is in that low to mid-20% range. Our dollars from that range moved up in April but because of the tougher comparison, our comps did retrench a little bit and they move back to 26%. Now, in the last week, we've seen a number of days in a row, it's not a pattern yet but we've seen a number of days in a row that have gotten back into that mid to low 20% range. And so we're hoping that maybe seasonality just is showing up a little bit late where we're going to get that bump. We do know that there was some cold and some wet weather throughout parts of the country early in April. And so we'll see whether we're going to get this up or not. But, yeah, our comps did get worse, but our sales dollars did continue to move up from March to April. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then just one more. I know you're reluctant to provide Q3 EPS guidance, but is there potential for this to be another loss? It seems like that would be, at least in my opinion, a little bit surprising given just the sheer magnitude of the promotional costs that you were throwing at this business at Q1, including a lot of the costs that were basically headed toward the Q2 transactions. So, again, understanding the reluctance, is that in the realm of possibility... John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : I would not. Yeah, Jeff, listen, it's so hard to predict because I gave almost excruciating detail about the sales during the quarter and then in April just to give you an idea of how volatile it is, how tough it is for us to see is the recovery taking hold and then it gets interrupted by the news out of Boston. And so I wanted to give you as much detail as possible. So with all that volatility, it's hard to predict. But I would not expect a loss in the second quarter. I would expect that because we have fewer of the one-time costs, because I would expect to see some recovery, because second quarter is seasonally a better quarter for us compared to the first quarter, I would not expect to see a loss in the second quarter. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then can I sneak in just one more real quick? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Sure. You ask \u2013 now you're going to ask me what EPS is going to be in the second quarter, aren't you? Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : No, no, no, not at all. Just on the labor line, I just looked at this one. So look, we all sort of look at the dollar costs for operating week numbers. It looked like you did a pretty good job of \u2013 at least they fell year-over-year. So the question becomes \u2013 I know you pointed to going back to over the last quarter that some inefficiencies surrounding both staffing in restaurants and managing food waste. I'm just trying to get a better hold on your ability to sort of maximize efficiencies or minimize those inefficiencies, I should say, in terms of both labor scheduling and controlling your food waste. Do you guys think you've made some big steps? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : I wouldn't say we have, Jeff. I know there's inefficiencies in there. We're really not going to go hard after them. When you look at labor, for example, labor is worth, I think, 850 basis points, of that 600 basis points of that is deleveraged because of sales. And so the most important thing we can do is get our sales back. Another 100 basis points is due to the very heavy promo that we did in the first quarter. So we had a lot of people visiting, a lot of people dining at Chipotle but they didn't pay for all or part of their meal. Yeah, we have to staff the restaurants, so there's about 100 basis points of that and then there's another, I think, it's 150 basis points to 200 basis points or so of, what I'll call, inflation. It's stuff that we did last year. We had merit increases for our managers and crew. We rolled out or introduced an education program, college education or education but usually college education. We started to pay for sick pay and then we enhanced our vacation pay. So those are all inflationary things that were in that kind of 150 basis points to 200 basis points range. So those are the big pieces. Underneath all that is there some efficiencies? Sure, but maybe that's 100 basis points or so. We don't want to go out and squeeze labor right now and drive those efficiencies at a time when what's most important is for us to have a fully staffed team to have the four pillars in place, have a team that feels ready to greet customers when they come in and hopefully at an accelerated rate. So I wouldn't want to go after 100 basis points on the labor line when what's most important is to have a great experience and let's encourage the sales probably to happen. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. It makes sense. Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Great. Thanks, Jeff. Operator : And at this time, we'll turn it over to our host for any additional or closing remarks. Mark Alexee - Manager, Investor Relations : Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. We look forward to updating you on our second quarter conference call planned for July 21. Thanks again. Operator : And this does conclude today's conference call.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve. Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon, everybody. Our sales recovery that began midway through the first quarter continued at a modest pace in the second quarter and we saw a return to profitability along with the opening of 58 new restaurants. During the second quarter, we generated total revenue of $998 million. Our sales comp improved by 6% from the first quarter to a negative 23.6% for the quarter. As a result of promotional activities, we are seeing slightly better improvements in comparable traffic with customer traffic down 20% for the quarter. While we would like to see the sales recovery occurring more quickly we're optimistic our Chiptopia Summer Rewards Program, which launched on July 1, will encourage more guests to visit our restaurants and that this will help lead to a sustained higher sales recovery. Though the program is just a few weeks old, we're already seeing approximately 30% of all transactions participating in Chiptopia. We are seeing further improvement in both comparable restaurant sales and transactions with comp sales down about 21% in July and traffic improving so that it is now down to a negative mid-teens for July so far. Diluted earnings per share was $0.87 for the quarter, down from $4.45 earned in the second quarter of last year. While our unit economic model has been significantly affected by the sales hit, it continues to fully fund our current level of new restaurant growth. Last week, Chipotle celebrated its 23rd anniversary. Throughout our history, we have been working hard to change the way people think about any fast food. And as we have grown into a national brand, we have cultivated and been supported by a very loyal customer base. As customers have fallen in love with Chipotle, they have also placed an extraordinary level of trust in us and have come to know that we will do the right thing when it comes to our food, our employees and our approach to running our business. Through the food safety events we faced last year, we lost some of that trust. Our customers have come to expect a lot from us to prepare, cook and serve fresh delicious food while pushing the envelope to encourage farming and ranching practices that respect animals and the environment and the people who raise the ingredients we use. We're committed to exceeding our customers' expectations and restoring their confidence that we will deliver upon our promises. While there are no quick solutions to restoring trust and bringing our sales back to previous levels, we're focused on a number of activities which will continue to emphasize driving traffic in the near term and increasing customer frequency. We will also focus on longer-term brand messaging and on advancing our Food With Integrity efforts, which have been key to building trust and loyalty with customers over the years. But the best thing that we can do in the near term is to encourage customers to come back into our restaurants and to ensure that our restaurant teams are delivering an extraordinary dining experience on each and every customer visit. In the first half of the year, we have invested more heavily than ever in marketing and promotional activity and those investments are beginning to pay off. Since the CDC's investigation into Chipotle concluded in February, we have done a number of things. First, we launched our largest ever mobile offer and to our largest ever direct-mail program. Second, we introduced a new menu item, chorizo, and we expect to have it in all of our restaurants by the end of the year. Third, we created our first-ever customer rewards program, Chiptopia. And fourth, we launched a new animated short film in an effort to help customers appreciate what is unique about Chipotle. Collectively, these efforts, along with excellent operations are bringing customers back into our restaurants and our teams are working hard to provide an extraordinary experience in all of our restaurants every day. The introduction of a new menu item such as chorizo is unusual for us. As you know, we have always maintained a very focused menu and rarely changed it. Instead, we focused on doing just a few things in our restaurants so that we can do them better than anybody else. But we have never ruled out additions or changes to the menu, and chorizo is one of the few changes that we have made to the menu in 23 years. Our chorizo is made with a blend of responsibly-raised pork and chicken seasoned with paprika, toasted cumin and Chipotle peppers. We sear the chorizo in our restaurants to give it a perfect char and we believe it's a great addition to our menu. It gives customers another option and one that has been well received, accounting for approximately 6% to 7% of entr\u00e9e sales in the restaurants where it's available. During the quarter, we also resumed serving locally grown produce in all of our restaurants. Typically, our local program for produce runs the summer and early fall months, during the time that makes up the local growing season for much of the country. As we look to establish Chipotle as a leader in food safety, it's also important to us that we remain true to our commitment to serving Food With Integrity, including locally grown produce. Through a partnership with PrimusLabs, funded by Chipotle, we are working with local growers to make certain that they can achieve our high standards for food safety and we are auditing any farms that we work with to be sure they are compliant with all of our rigorous safety standards. Initially, as we layer in new local produce suppliers that have met our new food safety standards, our local produce program will have fewer farm partners than it did in the past year but as we scale the program in the coming years, we'll have more local farms participating in the program than ever before. We're also working hard to achieve our goal of eliminating the very last artificial additives from our tortillas. Tortillas are the only food item on Chipotle's menu that contain any additives, which include a minimal number of preservatives and dough conditioners. While we have made significant strides in reducing the number of additives in our tortillas to date, the goal is to achieve a simple recipe with only a few ingredients, much like tortillas made in the more traditional way that includes wheat flour, vegetable oil, water, salt and starter for the flour tortillas. Finally, I'd like to address recent headlines surrounding Mark Crumpacker, our Chief Creative and Development Officer. We were surprised to learn of these personal issues and placed Mark on a leave of absence. We believe this will allow us to remain focused on our work and our efforts to serve great tasting food, to provide an extraordinary restaurant experience and to continue winning back our customers. One of the cornerstones of our people culture is to build top-performing teams, Mark certainly had accomplished that in our development and marketing teams, and we have the utmost confidence in those teams and the people who lead them. And we know that they will do an excellent job running those departments. In Mark's absence, we have asked Mark Shambura, our Director of Brand Marketing, to lead our marketing team and Carolyn Anderson, Executive Director of Facilities, Construction and Design, to lead our development efforts. And we have asked Curt Garner, who joined us as CIO late last year to lead our e-commerce team. Mark Shambura joined our marketing team in 2013 but his experience with Chipotle goes back further than that. Mark led our team at CAA Marketing from 2009 to 2011 working on some of the first innovative branded content programs including the animated short Back to the Start, and also worked on the development of our Cultivate Food, Music and Ideas festivals. In his role as Brand Director of Marketing, Mark already has been overseeing several critical marketing functions including all brand planning, content programs, digital \u2013 which includes web, mobile and social \u2013 and promotion and events. Carolyn Anderson began working with Chipotle 20 years ago as an outside vendor in charge of facilities management. She joined us as National Facilities Manager in 2005 and was promoted to Facilities Director in 2008 where she was able to streamline our reinvest efforts to create programs to empower our restaurant managers to be better stewards of their restaurant, leading to substantially lower maintenance and repair costs. Carolyn's leadership and the exceptional work she and her team were doing led to her promotion to Director of Facilities and Construction in 2012 and again in 2014 to a promotion to Executive Director of Facilities, Construction and Design. She has proven in building top-performing teams that have paved the way to redefine development's roles and responsibilities, and she has been critical to developing and executing our strategies surrounding sustainability, food safety and increasing our cash-on-cash returns for new restaurants. Curt Garner has been involved with our e-commerce team since he came on board last November and has been extremely valuable as a member of the management team over just the past nine months. Curt oversees all of our information technology infrastructure and its impact on future sales channels. So shifting our entire pipeline out of store sales projects to Curt's guidance has been very natural fit. We are confident in the current strategic direction of these teams and have full faith and confidence in Mark, Carolyn and Curt's abilities to deliver great results. I'll now turn the call over to Monty. Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director: Thank you, Steve. As we work to bring customers back to our restaurants and to reinforce Chipotle as an industry leader in food safety, it's never been more important to have top-performing teams in our restaurants and among our field leadership. It's the strength of our people culture and our teams that has allowed us to quickly implement many new programs in food safety as well as marketing. To be sure that our restaurant teams are aligned around our current priorities and that their efforts are directed at the right things, we have realigned some of the success measures for restaurant managers and teams and we're tying incentives increasingly for our most urgent priorities of having an exceptional guest experience, as well as effective local store marketing. We've also changed the prerequisite to becoming a restauranteur, placing a greater emphasis on measuring the guest experience, business fundamentals and food safety compliance. Historically, these measures have always been important but we are emphasizing them even more and providing additional tools and training to be sure our restaurants are exceptional in achieving these high standards. We've also changed how we calculate our manager bonuses to reward excellence in these metrics with the greatest emphasis on food safety. This renewed focus on an excellent guest experience, local store marketing, food safety and business fundamentals will be the means by which restaurant managers are eligible to be interviewed for restauranteur. Once they meet these green fees, as we call them, they are interviewed as before to determine if they have a team of all top performers and power to achieve high standards. Historically, these fundamentals were always important to becoming a restauranteur but our audits for them have become more specific and rigorous, and our expectations for their achievement more stringent. The added focus we applied to that part of the process is already paying off in terms of generating sound business fundamentals in our restaurant and the improved food safety audits that we're seeing. During the quarter, we made significant progress completing the implementation of an industry-leading traceability system which will be fully implemented in all of our restaurants by the end of this month. Already the traceability program has been rolled out in more than 1,900 restaurants. This has been a significant undertaking to put in place and we're very pleased to be so close to completion of this industry-leading food safety enhancement. Prior to this year, we had traceability in place between our suppliers and our distribution centers, and from the distribution centers we could trace ingredients to our restaurants using ordering and distribution data. But the significance of this state-of-the-art traceability system is that we will have the ability to know exactly which supplier we got any particular food item from, as well as the lot number of all produce, meat, Sofritas, beans, salsas, dairy and tortillas that are received in our restaurant. The system uses barcodes on every package to allow it to be traced from the supplier to restaurant the same way that overnight delivery services trace package shipments all over the world. This system is another significant way that Chipotle is becoming an industry leader in food safety because it gives us the ability to quickly investigate food quality issues in our supply chain or immediately remove food from our supply chain that we may find not up to our high standards. This September we will host our biennial All Managers Conference. This year's conference will include restaurant managers, field leaders, operations leadership and select individuals from support departments. The content for this year's conference will be focused on helping our restaurant teams to create an excellent guest experience and teach them to more effectively market their individual restaurants. This conference is an excellent forum to reinvigorate our restaurant teams and ensure that they are totally focused on the things that will most powerfully allow Chipotle to achieve its goals. On the development front, our openings continue to be on pace with our guidance for 2016. We have opened 116 restaurant so far this year, which is about half of our total planned openings of 220 to 235. We are pleased that we have a strong pipeline of real estate locations under consideration. But as I explained last quarter, we will continue to be judicious in evaluating those locations in light of the current operating environment with an eye towards delivering strong returns. We've refocused our real estate team on assessing future openings with a more conservative lens that takes into account our current economic model, particularly given recent changes to our average unit volumes. We have also temporarily shifted markets into our developing markets category in order to direct our new store investments towards markets with the strongest track record of opening sales. This may slightly temper the number of openings in these markets in the near term as we look to rebuild our sales momentum and will help us ensure strong new store productivity. The impact from this is primarily on where we open new stores with a minimal impact on the total opening. Because the real estate pipeline is inherently long term in nature, some of our efforts to reprioritize our market mix will not be realized until late in 2017. Of course, we will update you in the coming months as to how many restaurants we do expect to open in 2017. We're also working to strengthen the returns in our new restaurants by optimizing our average investment cost. This year, we will realize some cost savings through a collaborative effort between our design and procurement function. In addition, our real estate team has been able to find an increasing number of great sites with strong landlord work letters, providing for landlords to invest more in our build-out costs. The benefit of these efforts translates to an average investment cost that is shaping up to be around $800,000 for 2016 in spite of increased market pressures on materials and labor. The strength of our teams continues to be our key advantage. Top-performing teams allow us to take on new tasks more rapidly than others might be able to integrate and to create the great restaurant experiences that drive more traffic to our restaurants and delight our customers. We are confident that our teams will lead our recovery through this difficult time in our history such that we will emerge a stronger brand as a result of these challenging times and allow us to provide excellent value for our shareholders as well as the many additional stakeholders who benefit from our successful achievement of our vision. I'll now turn the call to Mark. Mark Shambura - Director of Brand Marketing, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Monty. Throughout the quarter, we continued to heighten our marketing initiatives to drive sales and increase positive perception of our brand. Through quantitative and qualitative research we've undertaken regarding purchasing habits, we have a better understanding of customers, their motivations and visitation patterns than we ever had before. We continue to increase promotional efforts more than we generally would because we think it's critical to reestablish contact and frequency among our guests so that they can recall how much they enjoy Chipotle. In the last few months, we executed an integrated approach which included a number of different marketing activities. We launched our largest ever mobile and direct mail promotions, we introduced chorizo as a new menu item and we will have it in all of our restaurants before the end of the year. We developed and launched our first-ever customer rewards program, Chiptopia, and we'll be studying the initial three-month program to help us develop a more lasting rewards program. We maintained a larger ongoing advertising presence than usual and we launched a new animated short film, A Love Story, to support Chiptopia which was aimed at reminding and inspiring our fans and attracting new customers. It's already been viewed in totality more than 17 million times with support from PR, paid digital and social media buy, along with placement on more than 10,000 movie screens. These marketing activities are an important part of our strategy to help drive our sales recovery and we are seeing encouraging results in the consumer research. In a June 2 survey by YouGov, for example, consumer perception for Chipotle turned positive for the first time since November. While sentiment is not back to where it was prior to these issues, it shows movement in the right direction. This improving sentiment is also supported by our own ongoing brand health tracking study which shows consistent upward trends since mid-January's all-time lows. During the second quarter, we saw modest improvement in consideration and admiration across key customer segments. And with Millennials 18 to 34, the key customer group for us, we continue to see they have the most favorable opinion of Chipotle. During the first quarter, new customer acquisition was down from the previous quarter but we saw improvement in this area in the second quarter and a trend in new customer acquisition which we can directly attribute to our aggressive promotional offers. While we still have work to do to increase key brand metrics and traffic volumes, we have a very full slate of marketing programs planned for the remainder of the year that we believe will continue to support our recovery. The first phase of our recovery plan, which began in February and which we are just coming out of, focused on winning back our customers. Based on the data we have, we believe that the majority of our most loyal customers have returned but many of them are not coming as frequently as they used to. The second phase of our recovery plan, which we are in the early stages of now, continues our win back strategy but adds a focus on increasing frequency and attracting new customers. Programs such as Chiptopia Summer Rewards and Love Story are aimed at helping us achieve these objectives. Just three weeks after launching the Chiptopia program, we have more than 3.6 million participants and are seeing approximately 30% of all transactions participating in Chiptopia. This is a significant start to the program and we anticipate our participant levels to continue to increase over the coming weeks. Most importantly, we are seeing growth in the number of guests that are visiting Chipotle at a run rate of more than 24 visits per year, our most frequent customer tier. These increased visits have helped the top line and have grown our traffic comp by about 5 points from June. It's still very early to draw conclusions on the long-term sustainability of these trends but every incremental visit from a customer provides an opportunity for us to further restore trust. All of these programs are helping to change the conversation about Chipotle. Q2 social sentiment is at 93% of the level it was pre-crisis and the response to our Love Story film has been extremely well received : 80% of consumer conversation is positive. Overall, our marketing awareness is at its highest since Q1 2015. Lastly, according to a survey by Ace Metrix, A Love Story is the highest scoring QSR ad they've ever tested, delivering strong results on breakthrough, which means high attention and likeability relevant to other measures, as well as change, meaning viewers feel strongly that the brand is moving in a new direction. The survey indicates that the film delivered strongly not only with our brand loyalists but also with lapsed customers and brand considerers. For the remainder of the year, our marketing programs will continue at a robust pace. Among the programs you can expect to see in the coming months are ongoing emphasis on advertising and digital content to highlight our commitment to using high-quality ingredients and preparing food using classic cooking techniques just as we have always done without cutting corners, and new content demonstrating how Chipotle has become a leader in food safety; targeted promotion inviting groups like students and families; the national rollout of chorizo by the end of the year; our annual Burrito Halloween promotion which will have a charitable component with our Cultivate Foundation; a holiday promotion and a gift card incentive program, continued improvements to our mobile and e-commerce programs and continued emphasis on restaurant level marketing, which allows our restaurant managers to delight customers on a very local and individual basis. We are encouraged by the progress we are making to improve sentiment about our brand and drive traffic to our restaurants. While we recognize that there is a lot more work to be done to restore confidence, we believe we have the right programs and the right teams in place to improve in these areas. I will now turn the call over to Jack. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Mark. The sales comp in the second quarter showed modest improvement from the trends we reported in April when we reported that comps were running in the negative 26% range. We'd like to see the sales recovery happen more quickly but we are as committed as ever to do all we can to reengage with our customers to restore their trust in Chipotle and reestablish customer frequency. The first half of 2016 has been focused on establishing and executing industry-leading food safety practices along with aggressive offers to invite our customers to return to Chipotle. As we begin the second half of 2016, we are optimistic about engaging our customers at a deeper level, going beyond basic, broad-based free food offers with things like Chiptopia, with branding efforts that are uniquely Chipotle such as the Love Story video, rolling out chorizo, and continuing to show leadership in food quality by removing the few remaining artificial ingredients from our food. Although it's very early, we're optimistic about the customer engagement with Chiptopia so far. Over 3.6 million actual or digital cards have been issued and, as Steve mentioned, nearly 30% of all transactions are engaged in Chiptopia. Sales comps over the past two weeks have improved to down 20% to 21%, in that range, but importantly transactions have improved from down 20% in June to down 15% during the first half of July, an improvement of 500 basis points. Our main objective with Chiptopia is to reward and incentivize our loyal customers who have decreased their frequencies since late last year and to restore their visit frequency back to their previous levels. Our research has shown that most of our loyal customers have returned to Chipotle but not at the same frequency, so Chiptopia is targeted at those customers, and the early frequency results are very encouraging. In fact, since Chiptopia began July 1, we've seen a 90% increase in the number of customers who visit 2.5 times or more each week compared to June. We've seen a 200% increase in the number of customers coming in from 2 times to 2.5 times per week compared to June. And we've seen a 140% increase in the number of customers who visit between 1 time and 2 times each week compared to June. So we're off to a great start with Chiptopia so far. We'll continue to engage and encourage our customers to visit often during entire the three-month program and when our restaurant teams delights them with delicious food and great service we have a great shot at maintaining or even improving these reestablished higher frequency levels. The average check has declined slightly during July by nearly 3% versus June as many customers have already redeemed their free chips and guac for registering in Chiptopia or they've redeemed their free burritos for earning frequency status. Some customers are spending a little less on extras. There's only a $6 minimum purchase price in Chiptopia and we're also seeing a slightly smaller group size. One important note in the accounting for Chiptopia, although the program is intended to last for three months ending September 30, there will be rewards available to be redeemed in the fourth quarter or beyond. Therefore, at the end of the third quarter, GAAP accounting requires that we defer a portion of the revenue from the third quarter into the fourth quarter or later when the awards are ultimately redeemed or the awards expire. It's not possible to project what that deferral might look like right now but we'll fully explain the impact during our third quarter earnings call. Our entire company is eager to see the sales recovery happen even faster in all restaurants and all markets throughout the country. Many of you on the call today probably feel the same way. While we'd certainly like to be further along, there are signs that the recovery is well on its way and continues to march along. The company-wide July sales comp of down approximately 20% along with the July TC comp down about 15% has come a long way from the low point in January when sales were down 36% and TCs were down 34%. July so far represents a recovery versus a low point in January of 42% on lost sales, meaning that we've recovered 42% of lost sales from January, and we've recovered 53% of the transactions that we lost in January. So, most of our markets across country are further along than this in the recovery. For example in Middle America, the Mid-Atlantic, the Southeast and the Southwest, which combined account for nearly two-thirds of our comp restaurants, the comp sales are down about 18% and the comp TCs are down 13% in July. This represents a recovery rate versus January of 46% on sales and nearly 60% on TCs. Our best market in the country is in Ohio where comp sales are down just 12% and TCs are down just 6% in July. We still have a ways to go but we're making progress. Unfortunately, the recovery is not as far along in the Northeast and on the West Coast where comp sales are still down around 26% and comp TCs are down around 21% in July. Of course, these are the areas closest to the events of last year and so the recovery is just not as far along as it is in the rest of the country. In fact, sales recovery for the Northeast and the West Coast combined is only 35% and TC recovery is about 45% when comparing July to the January lows. We returned to profitability during the quarter with EPS of $0.87 per share. Of course, fully restoring our earnings power is highly dependent on the pace and the magnitude of the sales recovery, which remains a top priority for us. Running through the P&L for the quarter, we reported $998 million in sales, a decrease of 17% versus the second quarter 2015. We generated restaurant level operating margin of 15.5% in the quarter, which is down from the second quarter 2015 but up sequentially from the first quarter of 2016. During the second quarter, sales deleverage contributed about 800 basis points of pressure compared with Q2 of 2015. Food costs were 34.2% in the quarter, up 110 basis points from the prior year. Underlying inflation was minimal during the quarter as increased supplier costs for our new preparation of tomatoes, lettuce and steak along with food waste more than offset last year's small increased menu prices and lower stock pricing for paper and beef. Food waste added about 70 basis points as we are still inefficient with some of the new procedures and we're still navigating through ordering and prepping the right amount of food at the right time, especially surrounding promotions. Looking at the rest of the year, we anticipate food costs will remain at right about the same level as any efficiencies we achieve are likely to be offset by higher avocado pricing in Q3. Labor expenses during the quarter were 27.7% of sales compared to 22.6% during the second quarter of 2015. Nearly all of this drop or about 450 basis points is due to sales deleverage. The remaining increase is due to labor inflation offset by better labor scheduling this year versus Q2 of last year. In Q2 of last year, we had a system reporting issue which led to elevated labor scheduling. Our underlying labor inflation is running at about 6% while hourly wage inflation is closer to 9%. Occupancy costs were 7.2% of sales, higher as a percent of sales by 180 basis points, all of it related to sales deleverage. Other operating costs were 15.2%, up from 10.9% during the second quarter of 2015 driven by deleverage and higher marketing and promo activity. Marketing costs during the quarter were 2.7% of sales and promo activity added 1.6% of sales for a total of 4.3% combined compared to 2.3% last year. Our investment in marketing and promo will remain at elevated levels as we continue to aggressively engage with our customers to regain their trust and loyalty. G&A expenses were $70.8 million in the quarter, which was virtually identical to last year's expenses of $70.2 million. A few months ago, we made the decision to temporarily hold off on hiring any new G&A head count in an effort to manage our support costs during challenging times. Instead, we've narrowed the focus of all of our support teams to only those efforts which will lead to safer food, a better restaurant experience for our guests or increase sales. Our teams have stepped up to the challenge and are supporting a greater number of restaurants without adding resources and are focusing the vast majority of their efforts on those three things : food safety, the guest experience and sales building. Of course, we continue to hire at the restaurant level to support our new restaurants and ensure every restaurant is fully staffed and ready to delight our customers when they visit. As a percentage of sales, G&A expenses increased 120 basis points to 7.1% of sales due entirely to sales deleverage. Underlying G&A for the next two quarters will remain at about this level but the third quarter will include the incremental cost of All Manager Conference, which is expected to be around $10 million. Our pre-tax income was $41.7 million and our tax rate during the quarter was 38.6%. For the full year 2016, we also estimate our effective tax rate will be about 38.6% compared to 38.2% in 2015, a slightly higher tax rate as a results of higher state taxes. During the second quarter and through yesterday, we repurchased $117 million of CMG shares at an average price of $438. We generated cash from operations of $118 million during the quarter and we continue to maintain more than $600 million in cash and investment. As we work to restore customer trust and restore our earnings capability, we still have the ability to fund our growth and buyback our stock optimistically. As of today, we have $123 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. These are challenging times, the most challenging we've ever faced. Our company is committed to restoring customer trust. recovering customer visits and restoring our economic model to its full potential, which we believe will position us to add significant shareholder value for a very long time. Thank you for your time today and we'll be happy to open the lines for the questions you may have. Operator : And we'll take our first question from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer and Company. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. I just want to better understand the strategy of your new loyalty program, Chiptopia, because with the comps still down over 20%, I guess the impact to the overall trend of the business does seem pretty muted despite all the data that you talked about including 30% of transactions using it. Can you just comment on the reasoning behind why the strong data isn't necessarily having a bigger impact on the recovery? And secondarily, what's the plan when summer is over regarding loyalty? Are you going to maybe switch to something that's aimed less at those that have already come back and maybe more at regaining those that you've lost? Thanks. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Yeah, the program has only been around for less than three weeks and the first week had a holiday weekend which we saw some pretty choppy enrollment during that time with the 4th of July being closed and the buildup to the 4th of July, it's just not a regular transaction or sales builder for us. Since then, we've seen a very regular engagement. We've seen a very regular ramp-up of people that are participating in the program. We have significant \u2013 every single day, we have over 100,000 people that are added to the program. The majority of them are registered in the program. And we've seen significant repeat visits. We've seen like 28% of the people that are enrolled, they're engaged in Chiptopia, have come back a second time. So we're seeing saying exactly the results we had hoped that our already loyal customers who had reduced their visits after the results of \u2013 or after the events of last year are coming in more often. We're hopeful that will happen is as we get into the end of this month \u2013 and, by the way, there's an incentive for people to come back more often as the months close because each month account towards earning the big end-of-program awards. And so achieving a level in July is the starting point, then it starts over. Basically, now you need to achieve that same level in August and then September. So it's very, very early and so we're optimistic that we got a 500 basis point impact in effectively less than three weeks. In terms of what's going forward, after this, we're going to watch this very closely, we're going to learn from it. We're going to find out what works, what doesn't work both for our customers and for our teams in the restaurants. And we anticipate we will have another program. We just don't know yet whether it will be another temporary program, will it be a permanent program? But it's very, very likely that we'll have something to follow on when Chiptopia ends at the end of September. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks, Jack. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Brian. Operator : We'll take our next question from Joe Buckley with Bank of America. Joseph Terrence Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch : Thank you. I guess, a couple of questions on Chiptopia as well. The improvement in July, you gave us sequential improvement in June, is some of that showing the benefit from the year-over-year comparison? If so, how much? And the GAAP widening between transactions and same-store sales, should we read into that the cost of Chiptopia is going to be rather high? And the last one on Chiptopia, and the last one, as you roll it out, are there learnings about the technology framework within the company? And do you have a sense that you have to invest more heavily in technology either on the expense side or CapEx side over the next couple of years? John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Okay. Joe, I'll take a shot at these. The first question was about the comparison. The comparison is not easier in July. In fact, if anything, the comparison is tougher in July. So we feel good about the 500 basis points of improvement so far. In terms of the average check, it's only down less than 3% in July. We had a gap even before July started, Joe, and a lot of that was due to lower group size. It's also due to the fact that we've had promos throughout the last few months as we tried to earn customers back. With the less than 3% that we're seeing in July so far, right about half of that is due to the retention of awards, that was part of the program. We were prepared to offer compelling incentives to get people signed up, and so all you have to do is come in, get a card. You don't even have to register yet and you'll free chips and guac. A lot of those have been redeemed already. The fact that there's a lot of redemption of burritos already means that our customers are marching through the levels. They're already earning Mild status. A bunch of them have earned Medium status. And believe it or not, within the 12 or 13 days, we have thousands of people that had earned the Hot status, which means they came 11 times already and you can't come more than twice in a day. So you have to come basically 11 days and people had already been part of the program within the first 12 or 13 days that we were open. So, the redemption of awards we totally expected that. The other thing we did on purpose, we had a pretty low threshold where if you came in and spent $6, which basically means come in and get a burrito, you'll be part of the program. Again, Joe, our objective was to get as many visits as possible, the idea there being, once we get people in the restaurants and if we can delight them with a terrific experience we have a shot at keeping them. And so we didn't want set a high threshold and so that has contributed to folks participating without all the add-ons, without the drinks and things like that. So the average check, we are ready for that and we think gaining the customer visit is most important and we'll work on the average check later. And then, in terms of technology, I don't know if Curt is on the phone. I think the question, Joe, was have we learned something about technology and do we have to make significant investments in technology going forward with our customer? Curtis Evander Garner - Chief Information Officer : Hi, Joe. This is Curt. Chipotle has got some great technology assets already in place with the mobile app that's very popular in the marketplace and in-store technology that's very capable. I think \u2013 and certainly we're committed to continuing to innovate and build upon those experiences and reduce friction in the customer experience with them. I think the great opportunity that we have going forward as we look at investment is capitalizing upon these programs to understand the incredible amount of data that we now have available to us as our customers engage in programs like Chiptopia. We're already starting to see some significant insights and learnings from that data and I think there's an opportunity for us to continue to do more in that space around personalization and other ordering capabilities that will, again, remove friction for our customers. Joseph Terrence Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Just two related questions on the comp. One, in terms of the recovery, you mentioned a couple times that maybe the pace was slower than you had initially expected. I'm just wondering what you believe the greatest impediment or frustration is with the survey work you've done or learnings or whatnot, and whether or not you feel confident in that full recovery or whether that just seems harder to see at this time? And the second one was just how would you define success with the comp? I'm just wondering going from here, it seems like you are down 21% in July. What's the pace of expected improvement in 3Q? How do you think about the 4Q comparison? I'm just trying to define what success might be. Thanks. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Jeff, success to us is getting all the sales back. The timeframe, we can't predict what that is. We're frustrated that we're further along but there's never been a case like this. Any of the case studies that we looked at in the past just didn't have the amount of publicity and didn't have things like what happened in March where nothing happened and yet there was a news story about somebody \u2013 or that some of our crew that didn't work because they were ill, didn't show up to work, no customers got sick, and yet that turned into a news story. So it's been frustrating that there have been things beyond our control where things had worked perfectly well and we followed all our protocols, and yet that still caused our recovery to see a setback. So it's been challenging and frustrating but our objective is to fully win all of our customers back. How long it will take, we just don't know. In terms of some of the things we've learned on why it's been slower, we know that we have to build our customer trust back. A lot of the research has told us that customers are looking for more information. They're looking for a longer time period where nothing happens. And so, so far, so good in that. Mark had mentioned this. I don't know if you picked up on it, that he and the team are starting to put together a strategy where we will communicate what we've done in a compelling way. It's not something that we're excited to talk about in terms of food safety but we're doing some amazing things. We're talking to some of the best experts or the best experts in the country and so we are doing things that are industry-leading and we are going to find a way to share that with customers so that they will \u2013 we can rebuild their trust back that it's okay to come back to Chipotle. We're also going to continue to introduce things that make Chipotle special. And I don't know, Mark, if you want to talk more about that where we're going to talk about Food With Integrity, we're going to talk about what we're doing with ingredients and talk about the things that people have come to love about Chipotle. Mark Shambura - Director of Brand Marketing, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: I think in addition to the content and communication specific to food safety, you're starting to see us get back into a pattern of the marketing that we used to do with A Love Story. We're adding new news with chorizo. We're adding new news with Chiptopia and trying to reclaim our voice with the Love Story film and begin to get back into a rhythm of new programs and new news that reminds our fans of the Chipotle they know and love, and introduce Chipotle brand to new people with efforts like A Love Story. Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jeff, for the question. Operator : We'll go next to Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Two questions, if I may. One about the product and one about margin. First, on the product, obviously with all the changes you've made about in your supply chain, there's always some debate about whether people like it as much, whether the food just tastes as good as it did before you made some of these adjustments. The social media coverage varies on what people are saying. So I wanted to see if you had a view on that, whether that's played any role, a change in pace or perceptions on customers' traffic? That's one. And then the second question I had was for Jack about margins. I'm trying to reconcile what we're seeing in your margin structure now versus historically, which is to say I think you suggested at the current run rate roughly $2 million AUV, restaurant margins are kind of where they are in the mid-teens. If I go back to 2011 when your volumes were around $2 million, your restaurant margins were 26%. So I understand that there's been inflation and you clearly have some food costs associated with it, but I'm just trying to understand where that \u2013 if there's any way to bridge that roughly 1,000 basis point gap between what your margins have looked like at these volumes in the past and what you're guiding to now? Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Sara, I'll start with the food and the taste of the food. So during the time of the incident last fall, we didn't know the cause and so we looked at every single ingredient that we were bringing into our restaurants. And working with a number of food safety experts, tried to understand what the risk of those items were. The individual items coming in and I'll just give you an example that I think illustrates sort of how things happen. Take bell peppers, for instance. One of our experts said that it would be helpful if we could test the bell peppers before we bring them into the restaurant. Well the way to test them though is to slice them up in a central kitchen and then wash them, test them and then package them. That turned out to degrade the flavor. It does not taste as good as when our crews would expertly chop using a cutting board and a knife right there in front of the customer and then saut\u00e9ing. But in order to make sure that we had the highest food safety, we went right to the central kitchen. And we did this with a couple of other items also. And I fear that we probably did negatively impact the flavor and I think maybe some customers noticed that also. We have reversed that though with bell peppers and other items because we have developed with our in-house food safety expert, Jim Marsden, a number of interventions that we put in place from the farm all the way through the distribution system and into the restaurants. And so, with peppers, for instance, we now have our crews blanche the peppers in boiling water which would completely eliminate any pathogen that might be on the surface because blanching doesn't actually cook the pepper because it's for such a short period of time, but it's plenty of time to kill any pathogen that may be on the surface. Our crew then goes with the old process of with a knife and a cutting board chopping right in front of the customer and then saut\u00e9ing as usual. We did the same thing with lettuce. We put a number of interventions in place so we brought chopping lettuce back into the restaurant. And so we've returned, I think, our food to taste levels that were where we were before the crisis. But we're going beyond that and we're going beyond that in the elimination of preservatives and dough conditioners in our tortilla. If you look at the ingredients at Chipotle overall, it's a really, really clean ingredient list. And what do I mean by that? It doesn't have the kinds of things that are very hard to pronounce : preservatives and fillers and artificial flavors and artificial colors, all these kinds of things. So once, in the fall, our tortillas are rid of the preservatives, we will be in an extraordinary position to tell people, our customers, about our very, very clean ingredient labels and be proud to display them. And I think that's not something typical fast food can do. So again, we're not only bringing the great taste that we had pre-crisis but we're continuing to push Food With Integrity in ways that are going to set industry standards. Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And your customers, when you survey them, they recognize this and they kind of agree with your take on it? Mark Shambura - Director of Brand Marketing, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: They do. And in fact, Sara, our complaints amongst customers have actually gone down in terms of food complaints. So we feel very, very strongly about the quality of our food, the taste of our food and the customers' perception and satisfaction with the quality and taste. Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chief Financial Officer : Sara, on the margins, if you look at our 15.5% today and what's different then, it would've been a few years ago \u2013 and listen, I don't have the details of 2011, but I do know the pieces. There's about 300 basis points and, call it, 350 basis points are so, between 325 basis points, 350 basis points of what I would call nonrecurring expenses. Two hundred of that is in our marketing and promo. We're intentionally overspending on that line item and it's way above historic norms. There's another probably 125 basis points to 150 basis points or so of inefficiencies. We're wasting a lot of food. We're not very efficient with labor. And part of it is because we are taking on a lot of new procedures and that's been inefficient. We're being inefficient in terms of dealing with the promotions and we're tending to overstaff rather than understaffed. So that's in that 325 basis points to 350 basis points. Food costs, I believe back then was probably in the 31% range or so, maybe even below that. There was a time when our food costs was in the 30% range. And so without the details in front of me, I'm guessing that was probably 300 basis points or so difference in food costs. And what's happened there is we just haven't raised prices very much over the years. Our model a year ago so it could handle a 34% food cost. With the deleveraging effects and all the efficiencies, the 34% food cost is a lot more painful today. We also have labor inflation that has crept in since then, and I'm just guessing that's probably at least another 200 to 300 basis points. The labor inflation especially in the last year has been significant. We had intended to pass on the wage rates that we were seeing because of local pressures, because of raises in minimum wages, some of them very significant at $10, $12, $13, and we haven't really raised prices. We haven't passed on the cost of those higher wages. Probably a couple hundred basis points there. We do have recurring food safety costs that you heard me talk about. We talked about that being in the maybe 200 basis point range. I think it's going to be better than that. I would say that's probably going to end up in the 100 to 150 basis point. Right now we've got about 150 in there. And so that's the only thing that's really what I said is an absolute permanent. So if you add these things up together, you're probably in that 1,000, 1,100 basis points or. So those are the items. We're very aware of the items. We believe the most important thing we could do, we've lost 800 points because of deleverage. That's most of our focus this year, of course food safety first. Now, secondly is to recover our customers and we're doing that through offers, through Chiptopia, through branding, and then our focus, as Monty mentioned, is making sure that our customers have a wonderful experience when they come back because if we get our sales back, we get 800 basis points of margin. These other items though, we think we can chip away at these other items as well but we don't want to go after them aggressively until we've recovered as many or all of our customers. And once we've done that, then we know that we can make a lot of progress on these other margin items as well. Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Thank you. Good afternoon. What data are you collecting through the loyalty program? And what do you intend to do with it? And a follow-up, how is the turnover at the store level? And as you realign the incentives, is it changing? Or do you expect it to change? Thanks. Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer : Nicole, I think I'll take a shot of that and I don't know if Mark wants to add onto it. The single biggest thing we're doing is we can now match up specific customer behavior using credit card data and people's enrollment in Chiptopia and we've been able to go back, so far, we've gone back to June but we're going to go back to even a year ago before all these events happened to see the loyalty of our customers. We've got lots of outside data showing us what's happened to the loyalty of our customers. So we're going to be able to do a better job of seeing those customers that were once loyal a year ago, they were coming twice a week or three times or four times a week and have dropped their visits now to once or twice a week, we're going to be able to see whether Chiptopia is bringing them back up to the two or three or four times a week that they visit. We've done that so far just going from June to July and we're very encouraged and I shared that data with you. We also now have greater engagement with a lot of the customers where we can actually reach out and market to them. And so we have a communication link that we have with our customers as well. And then, Mark, I don't know is there any other customer data that you...? Mark Shambura - Director of Brand Marketing, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: I would focus mostly on \u2013 we used the data and the regression analysis to really hyper-target those who had descended in their frequency or those who had lapsed to make sure we could invite all of those people into the program. And now, we can match up those who are now in the program to determine what their return frequency level is and utilize all of that data we're mining there to help influence the evergreen loyalty program we are currently evaluating in the months to come. Steve Ells - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer : And then the other question was on turnover. Monty, I don't know if you wanted to comment on turnover? Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director: Yeah. Our turnover is going various directions for different positions. The crew turnover right now is fairly high. It's in the 130%-plus range and our kitchen manager turnover has sneaked up a little bit, whereas the manager \u2013 or the general manager turnover has gone down quite a lot. And we've really targeted general manager turnover in particular. In an effort to try to reduce general manager turnover, we are making certain to communicate and understand exactly the reason for every single person turning over. And in fact, you need officer approval for a general manager to turnover at Chipotle because we want to have that intimate of an understanding as to why they turnover. So that system has really worked. But we also implemented a similar program where any manager turnover is something that has to be approved by our team director, team directors in the company. And so we anticipate that we'll continue to work on that. We'll get a better understanding as to why some of the turnover is happening and continue to work on reducing turnover. Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker): Thank you. Montgomery F. Moran - Co-Chief Executive Officer, Secretary & Director: Thanks, Nicole. Operator : And that does conclude our question-and-answer session and brings us to the end of the conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer; Monty Moran, Co-Chief Executive Officer; Mark Crumpacker, Chief Marketing and Development Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve. Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everybody. We are beginning to emerge from the most difficult year in our history and are seeing many reasons to be optimistic that we are headed in the right direction to restore our business to a place our many shareholders will be proud of. But please note that while we are on the road to recovery, we're not satisfied and we'll continue to work extremely hard to make the necessary adjustments necessary to restore our business and deliver results as quickly as possible. From early this year, we have recovered more than 16 points of sales comp and we've recovered 20 points of traffic comp, and we're making steady progress toward further recovery. During the third quarter, we generated revenue of $1.04 billion, down 15% from last year on a comparable restaurant sales decline of 21.9%. During the third quarter, we opened 55 new restaurants, bringing our total number of restaurants to 2,178. And we generated diluted earnings per share of $0.27, which includes a negative $0.29 impact related to asset impairment. Since our recovery began, we have seen a gradually improving outlook for sales and earnings and fully expect that those trends will continue. 2016 will be marked as a significant reinvestment year as we continue to work to make Chipotle a stronger company in the wake of last year's events. Looking forward to 2017, and based on current trends, we believe that we will produce diluted earnings of $10 per share on same-store sales growth in the high single-digits for 2017. We believe that the full year 2017, we can generate restaurant-level operating margins of 20% and save more than $100 million in capital and operating expenses combined. To achieve these results, we must be steadfast in executing our recovery plan which remains the primary focus of everybody at Chipotle. Specifically, we're focused on delivering a safe and extraordinary guest experience in every restaurant, restoring trust and building sales, restoring our economic model and enhancing the guest experience through innovation. Monty, Mark and Jack will provide additional detail on some of these priority areas, but right now I'd like to speak to the last point which is enhancing the guest experience. Two important enhancements to the customer experience are menu innovation and digital ordering. We are actively exploring ways to enhance the guest experience by offering new additions to our menu. We believe that this is a good way to entice infrequent or lapsed customers to return as well as a way to increase sales. Any time we consider new menu items, it's important to us that they remain consistent with our food culture, both in terms of the ingredients we use and how the new items are prepared. A great example of this is chorizo, which we launched nationwide earlier this month. Chorizo now accounts for roughly 7% of entree sales around the country. Feedback from customers has been extremely positive and we plan to ramp up our advertising in the fourth quarter to support chorizo by encouraging our customers to come in and try it. We're also currently testing two different desserts and we hope to select one to offer in the near future. We believe that there's an opportunity to excite current customers and to attract new customers through thoughtful menu development and we're exploring these options. We're also moving aggressively to make digital ordering more appealing to our customers and more efficient for our restaurants. Nearly all of our restaurants have a second make-line in the back of the restaurant where we fulfill digital, fax, and catering orders. By optimizing the use and design of these second make-lines, we envision a time when digital ordering could account for a much larger percentage of sales than the 6% it represents today. Maximizing our digital sales requires changes both to the second make-line itself, and to the ways by which our customers place digital orders. Our original second make-line resembles the service line our customers see in the front of the house, though scaled down and it takes up less space. The new line is a much more ergonomic and efficient design, configured such that less labor will be required to produce higher sales volumes, and does so more quickly. The new line incorporates an advanced queuing system that takes advantage of a heads-up digital display, which allows our crews to assemble orders without distraction. The benefits of these new lines will be enormous, including faster, more efficient assembly of orders, reduced errors and more consistent portion sizes for our customers; all of which we believe will help us drive increased sales volumes. After some additional testing is complete, we will begin to selectively add these new digitally enabled lines to some of our highest volume markets where it can best enhance our out-of-store ordering experience. It's important to note, however, that all of our original second make-lines are still able to take advantage of enhanced digital ordering options, even though they don't have the advanced indicating system of the digitally-enabled lines. Our crews in these restaurants will work from paper tickets until their restaurants are upgraded with the new system. To stimulate additional use of these second lines, we're introducing a new mobile optimized ordering site that provides an alternative to our iOS and Android ordering apps. Mark will talk more about this new ordering option later in the call, but the new site makes ordering and paying for digital orders easier than ever. In addition to our new ordering site, we are testing a tablet based ordering option which allows customers to avoid the line and order in restaurant on available tablets and get their order made from the second make-line in the back of the house. This tablet-based ordering system will initially be tested in a series of restaurants that are equipped with the new make-line. When the full system is realized, the second make-line has the potential to deliver as much as 50% of the sales from some locations including digital orders from all sources, including catering and delivery services. Finally, we fully impaired the assets related to ShopHouse, which totaled approximately $14.5 million on a pre-taxes basis. We opened the first ShopHouse in 2011. And currently operate 15 ShopHouse restaurants in three separate markets. ShopHouse is managed by a small independent team, which was tasked with creating a compelling brand, which could develop into a compelling growth strategy and enhance long-term shareholder value. We're proud of the ShopHouse team, the delicious food they've created and the excellent customer service they've delivered. But after operating in three distinct markets, and opening in a variety of trade areas, ShopHouse simply has not demonstrated the ability to support an attractive unit economic model. As a result, we have decided not to invest further in developing or growing the ShopHouse brand and will pursue strategic alternatives. Although the exotic ShopHouse cuisine was not able to attract sufficient customer loyalty and visit frequency to make it a viable growth strategy for us, we continue to believe that our approach to food, people and unit economics with the right cuisine, with the right concept, can lead to a compelling growth strategy. And we are optimistic that our other growth seeds, serving pizza and soon burgers, both of which have broad customer appeal can become further growth strategies for us. While this was not an easy decision, we trust in our overall growth seed approach where we can innovate and develop new concepts, with a relatively small capital investment and little or no distraction to the Chipotle business. And we'll only invest additional resources, both time and money into growth seeds that show the potential to become meaningful growth vehicle, and a compelling way to enhance shareholder value. We continue to believe that we have an extraordinary potential and are fully confident in our ability to achieve it. Monty, Mark and Jack will talk in greater detail about our plans to realize our potential and build greater shareholder value. I'll now turn the call over to Monty. Montgomery F. Moran - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. Achieving a full recovery means having all of our restaurants at their very best in terms of serving delicious, safe food and providing an excellent restaurant experience while continuing to grow sales. As we move forward with our recovery plans, the guest experience remains our greatest area of focus. Providing an excellent guest experience starts with serving food that's always safe and delicious. While many of our enhanced food safety efforts occur outside the restaurants in the supply and distribution network and with enhanced technology, we also rely on strong restaurant teams and field leaders to carry out additional elements of our food safety program in the restaurant. Ensuring that we execute these procedures in our restaurants has been our top priority. To accomplish this, we have significantly expanded training, food safety inspections and third-party and internal audits in our restaurant. These audits help us identify opportunities for improvement and ensure that all of the programs we've put in place are being executed consistently and properly. To further these efforts and to continuously improve food safety in our restaurants and supply chain, we've also established an independent Food Safety Advisory Council made up of some of the country's foremost experts in food safety and food microbiology. This advisory council alongside Dr. Jim Marsden, our Executive Director of Food Safety, is charged with continuously reviewing our food safety programs and looking for opportunities to strengthen them even more. This quarter we shared some key points about our enhanced food safety program with our customers through a PR campaign aimed at highlighting eight key areas of advancement that we made. The campaign included full page ads in newspapers, as well as online and social media advertising in addition to print and video materials of Steve describing why our food safety changes are so effective. The campaign was very well received and it was effective in communicating the comprehensive steps we've taken. Details surrounding each of these programs continue to be available for you to see on our website. At the same time, we are keenly aware that safe food alone will not bring people into our restaurants. Instead, they come for delicious food and an excellent guest experience. This is why our restaurant teams are focused on delivering great-tasting food and excellent customer service in clean, friendly restaurants. This starts with our commitment to serving the best tasting food we can, food that is made with ingredients that are raised with respect to the environment, animals and the people that produce them. And we continue to look for ways to improve the quality of the food we serve, including our quest for better tortillas made with no artificial additives or preservatives, a promise we made last year and are close to fulfilling. So, as we work to rebuild our company and strengthen our brand, it is critical that our entire organization is focused on those things that will most powerfully delight our guests and speed our recovery. For this reason, we used this year's All Managers' Conference as a time to articulate to our field leaders and managers three areas of focus that are in their control. First, providing an excellent guest experience; second, marketing their individual restaurants, and third, restoring and protecting our unit economic model. Our officer team asked our managers to first train the fundamentals of excellent operations so that they could then proceed on the path to restauranteur. Our relentless focus on the most important things and implementing them exceptionally well is what has always made Chipotle great and we know that to ensure our sales recovery, we have to do better than ever to win our customers back. Also, great throughput is a key part of the guest experience at Chipotle and one of our key competitive advantages. To do it well requires constant training and focus. During the last year, where we made implementations of our new food safety program the highest priority, some of our restaurant teams have lost some of the throughput skills that they had developed before the crisis. And with high turnover at the crew level, it's even more important that we continue to emphasize and train the skills needed to deliver fast throughput, including the four pillars of throughput. Of course a primary reason our throughput slowed was that our sales slowed after the crisis. But throughput still can be and will be faster as our restaurant teams commit to drive this critical aspect of an excellent guest experience. Additionally, we are emphasizing the proper use of the second make-line with our field teams to enable the teams on the front line to take great care of the guests in front of them. This will be even more important as we layer in some of the technology that Steve spoke about, which will revolutionize our use of the second way of serving our guests. Our initiatives surrounding catering and technology adoption for mobile and online ordering, round out the makings of an excellent customer experience and will allow for further sales recovery and future growth. Our Restaurateur program remains central to our ability to continue to produce the leaders we need to accomplish our mission and guide our restaurants through the sales recovery. This program has allowed us the ability to relocate some of our best operational leaders in order to establish better uniformity of operations around the country. Specifically, in our fast-growing and high-volume northeast region, which includes New York and New England, we were not satisfied with our guest experience in terms of throughput and dining room cleanliness. By relocating some of our strongest executive leaders directly into these markets, we are now confident that they'll quickly return these restaurants to the operational excellence that we and our customers have grown to expect. These leadership changes include the relocation of an executive regional director and an executive team director, as well as the addition of five team directors. We have confidence that our newly strengthened northeast team will provide much needed support to our general managers and quickly and dramatically improve the guest experience. Over the last four years, we've added many field leaders to our ranks to be sure that we have the right ratios of restaurants per leader to carry out our mission. I have met with all of our field executives since then and I'm confident that they're all clear on our priorities and that they are the right people to help us achieve our mission. Prior to last year's issues, Chipotle had the strongest economic model in the industry. Of course, this model has been weakened due to lower sales volumes that we've seen this year. While it's critical to fully restore sales volumes and keep improving them from there, we also know that we need to improve our economic model now so that we can provide healthy returns even at lower volumes. Key to restoring our business model is making sure that we are being as efficient as we can with our financial resources, but doing so without compromising the strength of our support teams and field leadership. We are using this crisis as an opportunity to take a critical and disciplined look at how we manage our financial resources and we've established a goal of saving $100 million across operational, G&A and CapEx expenditures. These cost savings will not detract from the customer experience. Instead, we're finding these savings in a number of areas, including disciplined staffing and support departments in field leadership, better business terms with suppliers, operational efficiencies and new restaurant designs that remain true to our brand, but have lower investment costs. This more disciplined approach to managing expenses will allow us to strengthen our economic model to the benefit of shareholders while not compromising our ability to deliver an excellent customer experience. Finally, we continue to believe that expanding Chipotle in Europe holds a lot of promise for our future, but we know that to best ensure our success there, we need to provide the area with more strategic attention. For this reason, we recently hired, as managing director in Europe, Jim Slater, a proven industry leader, who ran successful operations for Costa Coffee and led Costa to become the number one coffee brand in the UK. Jim will be working to develop our European markets into an investable growth strategy. We're excited to have Jim on board leading our European team and together they'll work to determine the best strategy for our continued development in Europe. Through all of these initiatives, we're confident that the plan we have in place to drive our recovery, is the right plan and we know that we have proven leaders throughout this company who can inspire a culture of excellence and help lead the way to recovery. I'm confident that through our progress towards providing a better guest experience all of the time, increasing sales through marketing and strengthening our unit economic model, we will dramatically improve returns for our shareholders in the months and years ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Monty. I'm very glad to be back and I'm eager to share with all of you some of the important work that we're doing to bring customers back and restore our brand image. But first, I want to apologize to everyone for recent events in my personal life. I'm sorry that I caused a distraction for the company and I want you all to know that I've put this behind me, learned from it and returned to my role in early September, excited and with a renewed focus and determination to help drive Chipotle's recovery. I want to thank you all for your support and forgiveness, which has meant a great deal to me. Today, I'm going to recap the marketing activities from Q3 and then I'm going to talk about several important breakthroughs with regard to customer data, technology and restaurant design before reviewing development expectations. During the quarter, we successfully concluded the Chiptopia Summer Rewards program, designed to restore the frequency of our most loyal customers. In all, we had just under 6 million participants with more than 2.5 million of those earning rewards in the program. We issued 340,000 super rewards for customers who maintained higher frequency levels, including more than 75,000 Catering for 20 rewards. We are excited by the potential positive brand impact of 75,000 catering parties over the coming six months. Throughout the course of the promotion, we saw increased transaction and frequency levels. But most important, we have nearly returned to pre-crisis levels among our most loyal customers. After the completion of the program, we anticipated traffic to fall slightly, but we have instead seen our improved sales levels generally continue to hold, which is very encouraging. During the quarter, we ran three marketing campaigns each with different but complementary objectives. The first was a food safety advancements campaign Monty referred to, which was designed to communicate what we've done to ensure the safety of our food. The campaign was broad reaching, with more than 90 million impressions. Lapsed customers engaged more than any others with the video component of the campaign. Results of the campaign are positive and we will continue to communicate the benefits of our food safety program so that every customer can rest assured that our food is as safe as possible. The second campaign surrounded our Love Story, animated short film, which was distributed through digital media, social channels and in movie theaters across the country. The film has been viewed more than 60 million times and has proven to be highly effective at building trust in the Chipotle brand. The campaign also included the Love Story game, which challenges players to match fresh ingredients while avoiding fake ones. The game launched earlier this month and quickly surpassed the initial results of our popular Friend or Faux online game from the summer of 2015. Millions of people have played the Love Story game and more than 3 million BOGO rewards have been earned by playing the game. More than 35% of those have already been redeemed. The third campaign running during Q3 was the Ingredients Reign campaign which is designed to increase visits to Chipotle and build brand's trust by focusing on the high quality of our delicious ingredients. Ingredients Reign is running across nearly all media channels including outdoor, radio, print, digital, social and theater. Both Love Story and Ingredients Reign's campaigns exceeded our expectations, for this reason both campaigns have been extended to run through much of the rest of the year. Finally, with regard to Q3, I'd like to provide an update on our latest consumer research. Admiration scores and serves healthy and nutritious food attributes have nearly returned to pre-crisis levels. Agreements that we have appropriately addressed the food safety issues increased to 90%. Sentiment on social media is increasingly positive and press mentions were 80% positive last month. Both are at or near pre-crisis levels. However, considerations still lags pre-crisis levels by more than 10%, though it is up slightly for the quarter. Moving on to Q4 and beyond, we will be leveraging significant improvements in our customer data capabilities along with a shift in marketing strategy to aggressively target new and lapsed customers. By combining transactional information with other customer data, we are now able to identify more than half of our customers and reach them with specific offers and tailored messages. This important breakthrough not only allows us to target messages and offers to current and lapsed customers, but it also allows us to accurately measure the effectiveness of those efforts by tracking return visits. We have already delivered two targeted campaigns using this data and we are continuing to refine our programs in real-time. But this new customer data has implications well beyond more targeted and measurable marketing. The data allows us to very accurately measure customer frequency and details about their orders and behavior. For example, using this data, we now know that during the last six months, we saw nearly 30 million new customers with Chipotle. These new customers, or customers who we have not seen since before the food safety events of last year, in fact transactions from these customers accounted for nearly half of all transactions over the last six months. Additionally, we know how many of these customers returned to Chipotle for additional visits and how many of them became regular customers. When combined with our marketing and advertising efforts, this detailed view into frequency and behavior allows us to evaluate the return on various marketing and promotional activities. Beyond customer data, we have also now begun to benefit from the strengthening of our technology infrastructure. In just a matter of days, we are launching a new online ordering experience that makes ordering and paying for Chipotle from any mobile device easier and faster. This mobile-optimized website works on any recent, web-enabled device and it requires no app download. The new ordering experience offers a beautiful and intuitive way to order from Chipotle. This new ordering experience is in addition to our existing apps for iOS and Android that currently have a combined user base of more than 2.6 million people. Additionally, our test of smarter pick-up times has concluded and we are in the process of rolling this technology out nationwide. Smarter pick-up times allow us to adjust the wait time between order placement and pick-up times based on the demand and capacity of a given restaurant at a given time. This means that the customer is always presented with the shortest possible time between order placement and pick-up. Smarter pick-up times works with our iOS and Android apps as well as our new online ordering, and when combined with the advanced second make-line, Steve described earlier, has significant potential to increase our online ordering volumes and improve the customer experience. We expect smarter pick-up times will be rolled out nationwide by January. Recent advancements in our technology infrastructure are also going to have a significant impact on the customer experience of ordering catering at Chipotle. Next month, we will enable online ordering and payment for catering which previously was only available via phone and required in-store payment. The ability to order and pay for catering online will dramatically improve the customer experience while simultaneously decreasing our call center costs. The next step with catering is to offer delivery, and tests are currently underway. Both catering and mobile ordering will receive significant marketing support during Q4, a time of year where we typically see an increase in catering volume ahead of the holiday season. We have also been supporting the national roll-out of chorizo, and we're excited by the results. As Steve mentioned, chorizo currently accounts for about 7% of sales, and customer response has been very positive. 84% of customers who tried chorizo like it, and 70% of those who tried it say that chorizo increases their desire to visit Chipotle. And 77% say that the new offering makes them feel more favorably towards Chipotle. Because of these strong results, we plan to increase the reach of our chorizo advertising campaign by more than 400%. Next, I'd like to talk about television advertising and the test that's currently underway. We recognize the need for wide-reaching efforts to invite new customers to Chipotle. The fact that nearly 30 million new or lapsed customers visited Chipotle over the last six months shows that customers are responding to our advertising and promotional efforts. But in order to accelerate that momentum, we are considering national television advertising. Because our Ingredients Reign campaign tested positively in terms of customer perception and brand trust, we are running a 30-second ad from that campaign in multiple test markets. If the test reveals that television advertising delivers the results we want, we may begin to integrate national television buys into our advertising campaigns. You may also be aware that we are currently undertaking a review of advertising agencies. While we are pleased with our current agency partners, we have developed a robust new marketing strategy for 2017, and in order to ensure that we have the absolute best creative work on that strategy, we are reviewing potential new partners. The review will be complete by the end of the year and in time for the launch of a new campaign in the spring of 2017. Going forward, we believe that there will be opportunities to incorporate new menu items into our overall marketing. We have been encouraged by the response we have seen with chorizo and see an opportunity to build excitement among existing customers and attract new customers through the thoughtful addition of menu items that are consistent with our brand. Any new menu item will be accompanied by extensive advertising campaigns designed not only to tout the new menu additions, but to excite customers about coming into Chipotle. Finally, I'd like to report on the successful launch of a new restaurant design that has been in development for more than a year. The new design is an evolution of the current design, with improvements in lighting, acoustics, seating, customer flow and the presentation of our kitchen. Additionally, the new design is more cost-effective with an average cost of $760,000, which is about $40,000 less expensive than our current restaurant design. We also anticipate a reduction in maintenance and repair as a result of this new design. This new restaurant design is already open in certain locations and under construction in several others. We expect that more than 50 new locations in 2017 will utilize this design and even more than that, will benefit from some aspects of the new design. Our new restaurants have been performing at approximately 73% of our comp restaurant volumes, slightly lower than pre-crisis levels. But in areas where we have increased marketing of our new restaurant openings, that performance has improved, and we are closing the gap of those pre-crisis levels. In total, we are planning to open between 195 new restaurants and 210 new restaurants in 2017. As our returns on new restaurants have compressed this year, along with our margins, we've lowered the number of restaurants we plan to open. We will continue to focus on opening up the best potential sites that combine the lower risk profile with the highest possible returns. And even with our lower sales levels in 2016, we are not seeing a marked increase in cannibalization from opening new restaurants, which remains at less than 1% nationally. Most important, we view this reduction in new restaurant openings as temporary. Our long-term development pipeline remains robust, and with our new lower cost restaurant design, we are setting our new restaurants up to achieve even higher levels of return on investment. We strongly believe that the ultimate potential for Chipotle restaurants in the U.S. could total 5,000. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jack. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. When the year began, we described 2016 as a year where we will make significant investments to ensure our food is safe and encourage our customers to return to Chipotle. We knew these significant investments would put additional pressure on our margins in the form of elevated food costs, higher advertising and promotion costs, and higher labor costs to serve our returning customers. We intentionally did not emphasize restaurant efficiencies and even encouraged extra staffing in our restaurants during promotion period because we did not want to risk trading a few points of margin on the P&L in return for disappointing a customer, who visits an understaffed restaurant. The sales decline, combined with these investments and inefficiencies, have resulted in significant declines to our margins. As we near the end of 2016 and we begin to look ahead to 2017, we'll continue to do all we can to restore customer trust and recover customer visits. We also are committed to taking important steps to restore our economic model. With the strategies you've heard Steve, Monty, and Mark talk about, we believe we can deliver comps in the high single-digit range for the full year in 2017. Of course, we hope these strategies will deliver an even greater sales increase. But we believe this comp projection represents a stretch, yet responsible goal. With a focus on delivering greater efficiencies in our restaurants, identifying cost savings in everything we buy in our restaurants and in our offices, supporting our growing restaurant base with flat G&A, and beginning to normalize our promotion and advertising, we expect to deliver a restaurant level margin of 20% and an EPS of $10 in 2017. While these projected results do not fully restore our economic model, it's an important step in the right direction. We continue to believe we can, over time, fully recover our restaurant margins as sales recover. From the unit economic standpoint, these projected results would lead to an average restaurant volume of around $2 million and restaurant ROI of around 50%. And the return potential for new stores is even greater as we expect the average new store investment to decline to around $760,000 in 2017. I'll talk more about what to expect in 2017 and in Q4, but now let me recap our results for the third quarter. During the third quarter, we reported sales of $1.04 billion, a 15% decrease from the third quarter of 2015. Our reported sales were reduced by $11.5 million because of deferred revenue related to our summer Chiptopia promotion. As a reminder, Chiptopia ended on September 30 and we recorded deferred revenues associated with rewards earned but not yet redeemed. These rewards can be redeemed or will expire over the next six months and the deferred revenue will be recognized over this period. As a result, we reported a negative same-store sales comp of negative 21.9%, which included a negative 0.8% impact from the revenue deferral. The Q3 comp is comprised of July down 23.8% and that includes 100 basis points from the revenue deferral; August was down 21.7%, which includes 70 basis points from the revenue deferral; and September was down 20.1% which includes 70 basis points from the deferral. And while October comps for the first two weeks are affected by Hurricane Matthew and were down about 21%, for the past 10 days have recovered and normalized, and we're down around 19%. But we're not satisfied, we're still being down around 19%. We continue to see small, but steady progress month-after-month. As a side note, July had improved to declines in the 21% range in the weeks before our Q2 earnings report, but then was impacted by a negative month end trading day effect, plus comparing to our Friends and \u2013 Friends or Faux BOGO from 2015 which ran the last week of July and into early August, and was also impacted by the Chiptopia revenue deferral. Our traffic trends have also suddenly improved and were down 15.2% overall in the quarter compared to down 19.6% in June. Transactions improved to 13.4% in September and most recently are running down 14% in the past week or so. Chiptopia helped drive the sales and transaction improvement in the quarter, as our most loyal customers returned to their historic frequency pattern, as Mark mentioned. On a regional basis, we continue to see wide variances in the progress of the recovery. With comp sales in the Midwest and middle regions of the country, down in the 17% range in September outperforming the coastal areas, especially in the Pacific coast in the northeast, which are down closer to the 24% to 25% range in September. From a transaction standpoint, there are several markets, including Kansas City, Chicago, Denver and Minneapolis where traffic is now down only in the high single-digits. We know that restoring customer habits takes time and to help ensure that renewed habits established during Chiptopia for our most loyal customers continue to hold, A Love Story campaign that Mark mentioned was launched this month. Although hard to estimate customers' behavior in October from only a few weeks of data, so far our high frequency customers are continuing to visit this month with similar frequency to September. Restaurant level margin was 14.1%, down from 15.5% in the second quarter of this year. The deferred revenue related to Chiptopia negatively impacted our restaurant level margin by nearly 100 basis points, so our underlying margin was 15.1%. The remaining decline from Q2's margin of 15.5% is due to higher marketing and promo costs related to Chiptopia and higher food cost. Food costs were 35.1% of sales but excluding the effect of the deferred revenue, underlying food cost was 34.7%. This represents a sequential increase from Q2 of 50 basis points primarily due to much higher cost for avocados. Avocado supply declined during the summer. We began to experience higher pricing. Although we had hoped that this would be a temporary spike, in recent weeks though, supply has become even tighter and pricing has become much more volatile than expected. In fact, we've seen that some competitors recently have posted signs on their doors saying they are out of avocados altogether. We have remained in supply of avocados, but case pricing has risen from an average of about $30 per case during the first half of the year to a case pricing approaching $80 this month. Because of these higher avocado prices, food costs will remain above 35% in Q4 before seeing relief in early 2017. Our labor costs for the quarter were 27.6% of sales, up from 22.2% of sales last year. Without the revenue deferral, labor costs were 27.3% of sales. Sales deleverage accounted for approximately 300 basis points and the remaining increase relates to inflation and additional labor related to Chiptopia and other promotions. Underlying wage inflation was in the 5% to 6% range in the quarter. Labor was about $9 million higher in Q3 versus Q2 this year to support higher sales levels as our transaction trends continued to improve. We also had increased labor as we returned to prepping produce inside of the restaurants. And we also had increased labor with the higher promo level activity of Chiptopia. In prior years, total labor dollars had been relatively flat from the second quarter to the third quarter. Other operating expenses as a percent of sales were 16% during the quarter, an increase from 11.1% last year. About 290 basis points of the year-over-year increase is due to sales deleverage. Marketing and promo expenses combined were 4.8% of sales during the quarter, which is double the rate of marketing and promo from the prior year, and it was 50 basis points higher than Q2 due to Chiptopia. In Q4, we anticipate our marketing and promo will remain at about the same level as we test TV in a few markets. Also, as we invest in ad support in Chorizo, and as the Chiptopia earned rewards are redeemed and expensed in our promo line. G&A costs for the quarter were $78.4 million, or 7.6% as a percent of sales. Underlying G&A, excluding stock comps was $61.9 million in the quarter. During the quarter, we held our bi-annual All Manager Conference which totaled about $10 million, and $8 million of that was expensed in the third quarter. As a reminder, this conference will not be held in 2017, although we traditionally hold a smaller field leadership conference, which we expect would cost between $1 million and $2 million. Excluding this year's AMC, our G&A was flat year-to-date on a total dollar basis compared to 2015, despite supporting an additional 247 new restaurants opened over the past year. We froze our support head count early in the summer and have been actively prioritizing where we invest our support to ensure that we're investing in providing an excellent guest experience and recovering sales. As we look ahead to 2017, we're planning to continue to keep our underlying G&A expenses, before stock comp, flat compared to 2016, and lower on a percent of sales basis, despite growing our restaurant base by another 200 restaurants. For the full year 2016, we estimate our effective tax rate will be 38.2%, in line with 2015. The full year 2016 estimated effective tax rate benefited from additional federal tax credits earned and a tax benefit from previously earned California state tax credit that we now estimate will be realized, and they were offset by higher estimated state tax rates. We currently anticipate the full year 2017 effective tax rate will be 39.5% and this higher expected rate for 2017 does not include the benefit of the previously mentioned tax credits related to prior year. Third quarter net income was $7.8 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.27. This included the negative impact of $0.23, related to revenue deferral and a negative impact of $0.29 for the impairment of ShopHouse. Before these adjustments, Q3 EPS was $0.79 or $0.08 lower than Q2 of this year due to the AMC costs, the cost of Chiptopia, and higher avocado costs. As of September 30, we maintained $609.8 million of cash and investments. During the quarter, we generated cash from operations of $101 million and generated free cash flow of $36 million. We also repurchased $70.3 million of our stock during the quarter at an average price of $409 per share. Over the life of our share repurchase program, we've repurchased $1.9 billion of our stock at an average price of $289 per share. We'll continue to manage our balance sheet to invest in our sales recovery, grow our business, and opportunistically return cash to shareholders via share repurchases. Recently our Board of Directors approved an additional $100 million of repurchase authorization. And as of yesterday's close, and including the additional approval, we now have $154.6 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Looking ahead to Q4, we will begin to compare against last year's comp of negative 14.6%. So of course our comp will improve against that soft comparison and will likely be in the negative low single-digits. Margins are expected to remain in the mid-teens, as the benefit of a continued, steady sales recovery and a reversal of the deferred revenue from Q3 will be offset by Q4 having seasonally lower average daily sales. G&A will be about $10 million lower than Q3 because of the AMC expense not recurring and slightly lower stock comp. And we believe EPS will improve to around $1 per share. Avocado pricing is the big wildcard as every $10 per case price movement up or down will impact the EPS by $0.17. As I mentioned earlier, 2016 has been a year of significant investment in food safety and restoring customer trust and recovering customer visits. It has been a difficult year in terms of margins and earnings driven by lower sales including related deleverage and the impact from these significant investments. We will continue to work harder to recover our sales, shifting our strategy from giveaways, discounts and rewards to new menu items, technology-driven convenience, better operations including faster throughput, and more aggressive brand marketing, including TV. We know that fully restoring our previously industry-leading economic model depends on fully recovering our sales. We feel confident that we have the teams in place to execute our strategies in 2017 and achieve a high single-digit comp sales increase, a 20% restaurant-level margin, and a $10 EPS. Our comp target will not be an easy hurdle to meet, and of course, we are not in complete control of it. But we are in control of how we manage our restaurants, and we are in control of how we manage our expenses both in the restaurants and with our support G&A. To earn a full year 2017 target of 20% restaurant-level operating margin, we need to earn about 50 basis points of additional margin versus the current underlying run rate of about 15%. We will recover this 500 basis points in several ways. First, by effective scheduling of our crews to ensure we have the right staff at the right times to deliver an excellent guest experience. But also to ensure we're not ever overstaffed, especially during low sales periods. We can manage our food costs more effectively by reducing waste by ordering, prepping and cooking the correct quantities throughout the day. By cooking to ideal temperatures which not only makes our food taste better, it also results in avoiding unnecessarily \u2013 unnecessary yield loss. We can also more effectively manage smaller but important restaurant costs such as repairs and maintenance and kitchen supplies which has grown faster than sales in recent years. We have invested heavily in training our field leaders recently to effectively manage the business culture in the restaurants they oversee. These field leaders spent two full days in what we have called a Business Boot Camp and they have been training their GMs and reinforcing how to create an excellent guest experience, while effectively managing their P&L. We also expect promo costs, which are in other operating costs, will normalize in 2017 as we reduce reliance on giveaways and discounts. And marketing will either normalize or will remain at elevated levels in support of efforts such as TV advertising, which we would expect will result in higher sales and create leverage on the rest of the P&L. In addition, we have an internal goal of saving at least $100 million in recurring annual costs. This includes a review of everything we buy, both in the restaurants and in our offices. It also includes capital expenditures including the new, more efficient restaurant design Mark mentioned which will reduce our investment costs from over $800,000 to around $750,000 in 2017, a savings of nearly $2,000 \u2013 I'm sorry, savings of nearly $10 million in 2017 alone. As I mentioned previously, we plan to keep our underlying G&A costs before stock comps flat from 2016 to 2017. In dollar terms, that would result in G&A before stock comp of around $220 million in 2017. We chose not to fill about 100 staff positions this year which were vacated during the turnover and not refilled but were approved in 2015, but were unfilled head count adds, all of which will save around $10 million annually and will help our underlying G&A dollars remain at the current level. Our teams are effectively supporting our restaurants by stretching the ratios a bit and focusing only on those activities that maintain safer food, lead to a better guest experience, that grow sales or strengthen our economic model. We increased our field support significantly over the past three years and have nearly the lowest ratio of stores per field support staff than we've had in 10 years. We currently have nearly 300 field leaders, which include the area managers, team leader, and apprentice team lead. So even as we build 200 new restaurants on average, the field leader ratio will increase by less than one restaurant per field leader in 2017. Our restaurant teams and support teams are responding well to the challenge of more effectively managing costs and are energized by helping us restore our business. As we challenge our restaurant managers at the AMC, one of our restaurateurs, Philip Esposito, from our Newbury Park restaurant in California reached out to me the very day after the conference with an idea to simplify some our back-office functions. His idea affects every restaurant and will save us more than $1 million across the entire company. And I've seen similar commitment throughout the company in our restaurants and in our offices to be more disciplined and more discerning with every dollar we spend. And everyone feels ownership to do their part to help strengthen our economic model while we work to bring our customers back. We're confident that the approach we're taking will help restore our margin and our earnings capabilities without taking away from the customer experience. In fact, the techniques our field leaders are teaching will result in scheduling and deploying the restaurant teams to deliver the best experience and the most delicious, safest food possible which also leads to a better financial result. These efforts will allow us to generate respectable results in 2017, but more importantly, we believe we will ultimately emerge from this challenge stronger than ever as our cost structure will be leaner, we will be more focused than ever, and our skill levels throughout the company will be sharper. And our economic model with sales fully restored will be stronger than ever. Thanks for your time today. We'll now open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go to our first question from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good afternoon. Steve, I just have a general question on the overall operating approach going forward. One of the hallmarks of the Chipotle business is how simple you've kept the operations and how focused you've been on delivering high quality. And now we're hearing that you're going to shift the focus a bit towards menu innovation and perhaps traditional marketing tactics or strategies. So just wondering why you think that shift is needed now versus perhaps just going back to basics on focusing on delivering the high-quality experience. Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Well, David, I think that we're going to do both. We're going to focus on fundamentals and try to continually deliver a better experience through that method. But we also want to try new things. Again, to get some customers who may have lapsed, to reinvigorate our regular customers to encourage them to come more, and perhaps to even entice new customers who haven't tried Chipotle. It's important that when you add something to the restaurant, you take something away. And although with the addition of new menu items, we're not going to take away other menu items, there are things that we can do to create efficiencies in the way we prep, in the way we get ready for business, in the way we find leverage. Finding leverage is interesting because there have been suggestions that we add breakfast, for instance. Well, I'm not saying that we won't add breakfast, but when trying to find leverage, our second make line now has an enormous opportunity. The second make line can attract or provide for catering, for delivery, for the mobile app, to enable customers that are in line to get out of line and go to a tablet, and probably things we haven't thought of yet. It's extraordinary leverage because the labor to produce the food is much less at the second make line because of the new technology. So my point is that you need to balance everything in the restaurant. And so we will make some things more efficient, so we will be able to add things like a dessert item or a new menu item. Again if you look at some other examples of fast food places getting too complicated, I don't think they kept this idea of taking away whenever you add something. So on balance, you still have the same amount of ability to focus on delivering the extraordinary experience that they've been accustomed to. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I guess just a quick follow up to that, if I may. I guess you've gotten to $2.5 million without any of those new menu items. So I guess the question is, why do you think you now need new menu items to get back to those kind of levels versus just going back to the old operating approach? I guess I'm a little confused by that point? Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Well, David, this is Mark. The new menu items, I wouldn't worry that we're going to slip into the traditional fast food model of introducing multiple new menu items wrapped with advertising multiple times a year. Our business really doesn't support that anyways because it's really a one price for everything you get at Chipotle, unless you get something extra like meat or guacamole. So we really don't have the ability even if we wanted to, to add lots and lots of menu items. However, there is a considerable amount of value to being able to advertise to people, or to market to people something new. And we've seen it now with chorizo. It's been very effective, which is why I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're going to increase the amount of reach of that campaign four times. And what it does is it gives people a reason to reconsider Chipotle or just to add it to their routine where they may have dropped an occasion, and we're seeing it to be very effective. And so I wouldn't worry that you're going to see us switching to this model of repetitive menu additions with lots and lots of advertising around them. But there is a real value that we've seen now very tangibly with chorizo in terms of adding something new every now and then. So I really wouldn't worry that it's going to be a complete change in strategy at all. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. You highlighted a number of technology initiatives that will eventually drive sales, but at least one of the competitors in the marketplace has done that, it's taken a toll on earnings for several years as it turns out there's a lot of training costs, there's technology costs. So how much of that, if any, of those costs have you factored into 2017? Do you have a sense of not just the buying of the technology but what the training costs might be for such initiatives? Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Let me start, John, by talking to you about how the primary component of this thing works with regard to the technology. So the second make line that Steve referred to, we've had one in our restaurants for many, many, many years but the classic version. This new version is much more efficient. Whether or not you have the tech component added to it or not, it's just a better layout. It's got bigger bins. It's set up to be more efficient, and that new line actually is slightly cheaper than our existing second make line. And so that line that is about all the technology component on it is actually a little bit cheaper than our existing line. And so we're going to move quickly to have all of our restaurants outfitted with that new line starting in March 2017. So all new restaurants will have it and then we're going to selectively retrofit high volume restaurants with it over the coming year. And so I think it's going to be relatively quick. Now what I just described was the line itself without the technology component. It's completely set up to handle it. We add that line to the restaurants and then as we see fit, we can add the technology component to it and it's not a tremendously expensive addition as well. And so you're not going to see lots and lots of the need to build big kiosk in the front of the house, that sort of thing, because this system actually whether you're using it from a tablet inside the restaurant or from your phone in your pocket, uses a very, very similar ordering system to the one I described in my call, the new online ordering site that we've developed. And so there's very, very little overall investment in this thing and I believe that we can turn it around fairly efficiently as we roll it into our restaurants. Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: I would also add that often with the introduction of technology, there is a lot of expense in training to this new technology. With the second make line, this technology actually is very intuitive. So it's actually easier to train a crew person how to operate the second make lines with this new indicating system than with the old method. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So in your plan for 2017, have you factored in costs, training costs, labor cost to do this or is that not in the plan for 2017? You don't think it will be an impact? Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: John, we don't think it's going to be an impact. We think the labor is going to be neutral. We think over time it's going to be a labor saving. The labor per sales dollars on the second make line is more efficient than the labor per sales dollars on the front make line. Even though this is early on, what the teams have shown so far with this new approach is they can produce food a lot faster, more accurately. And so there's really built-in efficiency. If we didn't have second make lines, I would say this would be a major undertaking. It'd be a lot of training and it would take quite some time. The fact that virtually all of our restaurants already have a second make line and what they're doing right now, they're struggling to make the food on the second make line with a little piece of paper with a lot of abbreviation. What they're going to get instead of that is they're going to have a very clear indicator with the slate screens. And so they're going to be doing the same things they always have and with the restaurant that that was retrofitted in New York, the team just intuitively stopped, just gravitated towards the display screens and just intuitively just kind of made the food the way they always would except they weren't stopping like in between every ingredient or two to look at this little bitty piece of paper that's on the sides of a register receipt. So it's early, but so far we don't think there's going to be an increase in labor. The equipment cost is not that expensive. There will be an impact on depreciation depending on how many we can roll out, but it's not going to be significant. And not something that's going to affect our ability to get to within $10 EPS. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jason West with Credit Suisse. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yes. Thanks. Just a couple of sales questions. I think you guys mentioned, Jack, you're running it down about 20% in October. But I also thought I heard you say that you've seen a full return to your kind of most frequent users, which I think is new. Could you try to explain what's going on there with the different customer buckets? You're still down 20%, but it sounds like things are improving. Just trying to reconcile those issues. And then the other question on the comp outlook for next year, does that include any incremental pricing? Thanks. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Okay. Yeah, the Chiptopia was designed to go after our most loyal customers. It's a relatively small customer group, but it's a group that comes very often. When we look at \u2013 we slice and dice our customer group a number of different ways. And when we look at our customer group for those customers that come at least a couple times a month to one time per week or greater as one group. Another group would be a customer that comes, say, once a month. Another group would come two to three times a month and another group would come once per every six months. When you take that most frequent group, by the way, all of those groups were negatively affected by anywhere between 20% and 25%, meaning they all dropped down their visit frequency. And in case of the infrequent customer, we just lost customers. And we lost them to the tune of about 20% to 25%. After Chiptopia, we recovered to a point of where our most frequent customers were back to 95% to where they were before. Now some infrequent customers did not increase their frequency, but we were able to see some customers that were not coming as often as, let's say once per week, now were coming once per week. So we don't have the exact same customers we had before. One thing we've learned as we've gone through and we've gathered this data mine, this data that Mark talked about, we found that we have kind of a constant movement of customers that are coming. Some are coming more frequently, some are coming less. What Chiptopia did was encourage those customers who either were coming frequently and reduced. A lot of them did come back and then we encouraged some that were coming a couple times per month to come at least once per week or more. But if you look at that most loyal customer group that are coming multiple times per month, that group we've recovered 95%. Now the rest of the group is a much, much, much larger group of customers that come much less frequent. That's why the things that Mark talked about make so much sense. That's why TV advertising makes sense. That's why advertising things like chorizo, which is new news, makes a lot of new sense. Dessert, once we decide which dessert we want to go with, to try to go beyond a test market. These are things that you can advertise and appeal to a broad group of customers. And so that's what our approach is, to get that much, much larger, tens of millions of customers, to come to Chipotle until we can recover that group as well. And then in terms of the comps, we don't have any menu price built into the comp at all. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thank you. Two if I may. First, on that $100 million of recurring cost savings. I think you called out $10 million of CapEx. Does that mean there is $90 million of OpEx savings that you expect in fiscal 2017 over fiscal 2016, just as a clarification? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Not necessarily. There may be other things that we buy. For example, small wares, most small wares would be OpEx. There might be some equipment that will do a more efficient job of buying and we might be replacing. So it might not be a new store impact, but with replacing equipment, let's say grills for example, we're looking for a reduction in expenses or in what we pay for everything, and so there may be some additional CapEx. But I would say the majority of the $100 million is going be in operating expenses. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And secondly, the Chiptopia program obviously was successful with your most frequent customers, but given some of the complexity regarding the program, maybe some of your not-as-frequent customers didn't know necessarily how to use it or what their benefit would be or going that number of times in a month would be a lot to ask if someone that doesn't go to the brand, for example, once a week. Is there a way to approach loyalty in a different way that would have a broader appeal and is that potentially part of the plan in 2017 and 2018 to have something that's simpler and that will be a permanent part of your offering? Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yes, John, an interesting thing which I mentioned in my remarks I think that's worth noting is that over the last six months, we saw 30 million customers that were either new or people that we hadn't seen before come into Chipotle. And this is thanks to this new data capability that we have. And additionally we're now able to reach a very large number of those people. And so we have dramatically improved our ability to reach out to these customers. And they're in all frequency categories by the way. Those 30 million people range from one to more than 10 times in terms of number of visits during that six-month period. So they're all across the different frequency bands. But we have such an extraordinary new ability to reach them that we're evaluating exactly how best to use that in order to create incentives for them. We don't want to rely on a continuing basis on discounting. Obviously that cheapens the brand and creates a sense of entitlement ultimately such that people just begin to expect it. So we're very carefully evaluating how that's going to look. But to answer your question, I would say, yes. We're going to look at how we can use this new information we have about our customers and this really amazing ability to track whether or not what we do with them drives them in. So we can determine now with a very high degree of fidelity, whether or not an offer or an ad of a particular type or any other type of promotion or communication actually resulted in a visit from these customers. And so I don't want to commit right now to exactly what we're going to do, because it's really just been over the last few months that we've developed this capability. But we're absolutely going to use it in a way that allows us to create ongoing incentives, to create the momentum for these less frequent customers to become more frequent. I'm very excited about just the simple idea that so many new customers came to Chipotle. I mean, it says a couple of things to me. I mean first it says, even though it's tempting to think that, well, people are still reluctant to come to Chipotle, with that volume of people coming in as new customers, I think that's unlikely. That's showing a pretty major shift in people's attitudes. But also, those somewhat infrequent new customers have extraordinary potential to become frequent. They're the ones who have the potential to create great comps for us in the future, and so we're going to be doing whatever we can to make their stay at Chipotle as enjoyable as possible. So I can't give you a firm answer, but I hope that helps you understand sort of how we're going to be looking at it. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : We'll go for our next question to David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks, and good evening. First to follow up on some of that questioning about the marketing, you mentioned a few things, the new product news, National TV, all these things will be part of Chipotle's future, potentially. And you've tinkered with loyalty and now looking to make your bigger push behind mobile order and may be even delivery. Based on the analysis you've done so far, because it's hard for us to assess, what potential changes to marketing among these and maybe some other stuff do you believe will be the most promising and most likely that we will see? Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Well, they all have promise in their own right. I think though that as I mentioned in answering the last question, we've seen very, very large numbers of new customers experiencing Chipotle. And so I think there's extraordinary potential for us to continue bringing in large groups of new customers, and that's the reason why we're currently testing television. And television isn't a panacea. It's going to be a component of larger campaigns that we do, but it's very efficient when we get to the level of doing it nationally. And so, I believe that that probably, you know, has some of the most significant potential for us to bring in lots and lots and lots of new customers. And then, assuming that we create a great experience for them, when they come in the restaurant, they will then turn into more and more frequent customers. So I suspect that amongst those things, that has huge potential, but I will follow that with a very close second, which would be the increase in our digital promotion and the capability of online ordering. And I just want to take a second to tell you a little bit more about what I'm talking about with regard, for example, to smarter pick-up times, which is the ability for somebody to come into Chipotle and get an order very quickly after they ordered it. We've been conducting a test over the last several months of this technology and through our analysis of that, we found that when people place orders at Chipotle, there's a very significant lag between when they place the order and when our restaurants allow them to come pick it up. This new technology actually eliminates our restaurant's ability to set that time gap and instead, sets it automatically based on the load of the restaurant. And so we're seeing the potential to do as many as one entree per minute using this new system. And so the marketing that goes around that, that encourages people to place their orders via digital, assuming then again, those orders are fulfilled in this efficient and excellent way, I think has a tremendous amount of potential. So I put that as a close second to the top-of-mind marketing that we're going to be doing. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So, I guess, just thinking about some of the other pieces that have been or some of \u2013 part of improving the digital experience at the store. I know the POS system has been a part of upgrades that were needed to be able to move forward. Are there \u2013 is sort of everything else in place that you think a lot of this can be pretty plug-and-play once it's in store? Or are there sort of technological hurdles or technical hurdles that you think you're still going to be working your way through? Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Well, I think that most everything is in place. And I say that wanting you to know that a couple of the key pieces are actually going to be rolled out throughout the month of November. So we have, as you mentioned, we've had some issues with regard to payments in particular, and the new responsive online ordering website that we've talked about in this call and some other, including catering, will now have a more streamlined payment process and I won't go into the technical details as to why it's more efficient, both for us and for the customer, but having gotten over that hurdle actually enables us to do a lot of the things we talked about without further technological investment. Now, I do want to caution though that, of course, when you're adding anything that consumers are interacting with, and new technology for customers, there's always room for things to go wrong and we're going to need to iterate and refine those things, but I don't see any large technological hurdles that we need to overcome in order to implement this. We've overcome a lot of those over the last 18 months actually, and we're just now, in November, going to be taking advantage of a lot of them. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And then as a follow-up on the digital, the more one-to-one marketing. Is the dataset that you're working off of, my impression or my understanding is that the average consumer isn't scanning or swiping a dedicated Chipotle card at Chipotle, is that working off of last names and last four digits of credit cards? And then how does that evolve or change as we move towards chip-and-pin implementation when you don't get that data anymore? Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Well, yeah, I mean, we are using a combination of last name and four digits of the card, but also it's a unique combination of both Chipotle-owned and commercially available databases to create actual profiles of each customer. So we have the ability to now, as I mentioned, reach many, many, many of our customers using this technology. Chip and Pin is something that we have yet to implement at Chipotle for throughput reasons and we very much hope that we're going to leapfrog chip and pin, but I feel reluctant to go too far into the technological reasoning behind that without Curt, our CIO weighing in on it. But there are more efficient ways of making payments than chip-and-pin and it doesn't seem to be \u2013 even though it is required by the credit card companies, it does not seem to be the technology that's going to be readily adopted by choice for consumers. And so we are simultaneously working on a variety of payment options ourselves and we expect that those will augment any loss should we ever implement chip-and-pin. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. I'm just curious what are the pros and cons of maintaining an almost 10% unit growth range in 2017 on the heels of what looks to be like almost 12 months of a 20%-plus average transaction decline. Just curious why you guys are sticking with the big numbers instead of essentially taking it down 10% or 20% just until the transactions stabilize a little bit? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Jeff, we took a careful look at our whole portfolio and we did pare it down \u2013 we pared it down, where we eliminated either remote sites that are hard to operate or new or developing markets where the risk of low sales and the risk of trying to staff a team and attract customers in an area where that doesn't have, perhaps, a strong brand awareness or brand appreciation. And so we pared those down. But to cut the openings even further, there just isn't an advantage to doing so. The impact, when we open up restaurants on our existing comp is minimal. It's always been less than 1%; it's still less than 1% this year and so it's not like there would be a significant comp rebound. We have the pipeline, so, other than paring down as I mentioned, we have a strong pipeline, there just isn't an advantage. The recovery doesn't get jumpstarted just because we would peel off another 25, 50 or 100 openings. So there wasn't any advantage to doing so. So we thought we did the responsible thing in doing what we could to shore up the quality of the portfolio. But going beyond that just didn't offer any benefit from what we could see. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And just one follow up, on the potential timeline for the National TV and heightened digital capability rollout, you guys mentioned it a couple times, but theoretically, how quickly could we see TV and under what circumstances would we see TV? Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Well, right now TV is being tested in three markets between October 21 and November 20. We'll evaluate that on a number of different levels and that television in two of those three markets is running concurrently with other supporting advertising, which is normally the way we'd do that, television doesn't stand on its own typically. And so as a result of those tests, we will integrate television, and as I mentioned probably at a national level, that is where the great efficiencies come in when you are making point buys like that. We would integrate that into most likely the campaign that we have launching in spring. Now that doesn't mean that we couldn't add some selective TV for certain reasons before that. But I'd say that certainly by March 2017 you'd see, if the test is successful, television integrated into the campaign. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : We'll go now to Joseph Buckley with Bank of America. Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Two questions. One, curious what the second make line today is contributing to sales? Are the sales off that second make line a significant part of the business today? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yep, about 6%, Joe. Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then bigger picture question, as you shift the focus next year to a little bit more on the unit level economics, are you coming to accept that the base level of average unit volumes and base level of restaurant margins may be lower and resetting that as the bar from which you'll grow going forward, is it somewhat of a concession that recovering the full sales level seems less likely? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: No, we're not conceding at all, Joe, that our top line sales can't be dramatically improved over the coming years. We are just recognizing that in the meantime though, it behooves us to do everything we can to be as efficient as we can be so as to drive the very best margin possible, even during a time where our volumes are still negatively affected. But like I said in my remarks, we're not going to drive those costs down to the point where we're negatively affecting the guest experience or the ability that our field teams have in order to continue to create really great restaurant teams and have great restaurant operations. Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our final questions from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Good afternoon. What level of share repurchase is accounted for in fiscal 2017 earnings guidance? And then also what will the cadence of new store development look like? Montgomery F. Moran - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Nicole, I would expect a similar buy as what we've seen in the last month or two. We bought about $1 billion worth, aggressively and that took us through like about April or May or so. But I would expect us to be at more this kind of steady level. We'll want to keep a strong balance sheet, somewhere in the $0.5 billion or a little higher on the balance sheet. And then we'll take excess cash flow and use that. So if in your model, if you take excess cash flow to assume that we kind of keep what's on the balance sheet or about what's on the balance sheet today and use any excess to buy back stock, I think you'll be in the ballpark of what we'll actually do now. We'll be opportunistic and we'll be more aggressive if the stock drops and less aggressive when the stock increases, but generally that's the approach we'll take. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: And to answer the question with regard to the new restaurant openings we've said that it'd be between 195 and 210 restaurants for 2017. Montgomery F. Moran - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, and the cadence will be fairly level-loaded throughout the year, Nicole, if that's what you're asking. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, they tend to pile up a little bit in Q4 typically, but we'll level-load as best we can. Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Montgomery F. Moran - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thank you, Nicole. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Nicole. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session and brings to the end of our conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

LLC John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to today's Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Mark Alexee, Investor Relations Manager for Chipotle Mexican Grill. Please go ahead, sir. Mark Alexee - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thank you, Greg. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our call today. By now you should have access to our earnings announcement released this afternoon for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016. It may also be found on our website at chipotle.com in the Investor Relations section. Before we begin our presentation, I will remind everyone that parts of our discussion today will include forward-looking statements as defined in the securities laws. These forward-looking statements will include statements of our management's business outlook, forecasts for comparable restaurant sales trends, estimates of food, labor, occupancy and marketing cost trends for future periods, G&A and other cost savings for the full-year 2017, and descriptions of the impact of new technologies on our business, projections of effective tax rates for 2017, projections of capital investments and statements of our stock repurchases, as well as other statements or expectations and plans. These statements are based on information available to us today, and we are not assuming any obligation to update them. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the risk factors in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, as updated in our subsequent Form 10-Q for a discussion of these risks. I'd also like to remind everyone that we have adopted a self-imposed quiet period, restricting communications with investors during that period. The quiet period for Q1 will begin on the 15th day of the last month of each fiscal quarter and continues until the next earnings conference call. For the first quarter of 2017, it will begin March 15 and continue to our first quarter earnings release planned for April 25. We will start today's call with prepared remarks, and then we will take 20 to 30 minutes of questions. Because we recently presented our 2017 strategy at the ICR conference, our prepared remarks today will be brief before opening the lines for Q&A. We ask that you please limit your questions to one or two per individual. On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. We will also have Mark Crumpacker, our Chief Marketing and Development Officer; and Curt Garner, our Chief Information Officer, available for questions. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve. Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Today, I'm more confident than ever about Chipotle's future. I believe firmly in our mission to ensure that great food made with whole unprocessed ingredients is accessible to everyone. And I'm very encouraged by our rapid progress toward simplifying our operations and ensuring that we deliver an extraordinary dining experience for each and every one of our guests, in each and every one of our restaurants. I'm also confident in the significant changes we've made throughout the last year to position Chipotle for a strong performance in 2017. These efforts include the implementation of an industry-leading food safety system, investments in digital to enhance customer convenience of ordering, expanded use of consumer data and analysis, and changes to our leadership to strengthen our culture and sharpen our focus on the customer. Our business was built on doing just a few things and doing them extremely well. As we continue to restore our economic model, I'm most optimistic about our renewed focus on simplifying our restaurant operations and delivering an excellent guest experience. Our restaurant teams and field leaders are quickly embracing this new focus with enthusiasm. As we closed out the quarter and shifted to implementing our strategic plan for 2017, our teams are more motivated, more focused, and more energized than they have been in years. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we generated revenue of $1.03 billion, an increase of 3.7% on comparable restaurant sales decline of 4.8%, and the opening of 72 new restaurants. This produced diluted earnings of $0.55 per share for the quarter. Our comparable restaurant sales improved to a positive 14.7% in December, as we lapped the softer comparison from December 2015. Since our last update at the ICR conference in January, we've continued to make progress in ensuring that every restaurant is delivering an excellent guest experience. Next week, we will roll out a series of critical updates to our Restaurateur program which identifies, validates, and rewards our top-performing managers. These updates will align the achievement of restaurateur status with the measurable elements that directly resolve in an excellent customer experience. This was not the case in previous years when managers who achieved certain targets related to our people culture could be promoted to restaurateur despite the fact that the restaurants were not necessarily delivering excellent customer experience. All our teams now know that the path to restaurateur starts and ends with the customer experience they deliver. We've dramatically simplified the process and metrics. Our teams know that in order to become a restaurateur, you need to not only deliver A level of customer service, but also show that you can sustain that A level of service. It's clear that this focused approach is already making a difference. I restaurateurs have demonstrated the ability to deliver the highest level of customer satisfaction, and they are achieving this success by focusing on the critical elements of running a great restaurant, hiring great people, and training them to cook and serve delicious food quickly in a clean and inviting environment. To fully align the entire company around delivering an excellent guest experience, we're rolling out a new compensation system for our restaurant managers, restaurateurs, and field leaders. This new program is designed to reward those leaders who are delivering the best customer experience on a sustainable basis. We're implementing incentives that not only reward our teams for running great restaurants, but also for demonstrating continuous improvement in sustaining high performance. Beyond our efforts to strengthen the quality of customer service and restaurant operations, we are also making progress on our key digital initiatives. We' have redesigned and simplified our online ordering site, enabled online payment for catering and integrated with several well-known third-party providers for delivery. And we are well into the roll out of smarter pickup times. With more than 1,200 restaurants now using this system and the remaining restaurants will roll out this technology next week. The initial results for restaurants using smarter pickup times are encouraging. Not only are these restaurants seeing increases in the number of digital orders, but customers are also seeing faster service times between the time of order and the time of pickup. This improvement in speed of service reduces the average customer's wait by roughly half as compared to our legacy ordering system. With these significant improvements to our digital ordering experience, we are now in a position to promote digital ordering more aggressively. Just last month, we began promoting our new online ordering site, order.chipotle.com in those restaurants that already have smarter pickup times. By marketing these offerings, we have the potential to dramatically increase digital orders. We're also working aggressively to continue to attract and convert more new and lapsed customers. Over the second half of 2016, we attracted millions of new or lapsed customers. And we are pleased with the rate at which these new customers are converting from new or lapsed to regular customers. We're also excited about the potential to make these customers even more loyal and more frequent. After all, frequent customers start as infrequent ones. And our data shows that customers become more frequent in restaurants that are delivering a great experience. That's why it's so crucial to elevate the quality of the customer service in all of our restaurants. To help us execute our marketing strategy, we recently hired two new agency partners, Venables Bell for advertising and MullenLowe Mediahub for media planning and buying. These new partners will support the largest advertising campaign in our history, launching in April. The campaign will focus on taste and great ingredients in a way that clearly differentiates Chipotle from the competition. We'll also continue to build greater loyalty with our existing customers through brand marketing centered around our commitment to serving delicious food made from ingredients raised responsibly. These marketing initiatives combined with the ongoing improvements in the customer experience, and improved digital ordering channels gives me great confidence that 2017 is teed up to be a very successful year for Chipotle. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jack. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. As we start the new year we're optimistic about the direction we're headed. And we've already seen encouraging signs of improved restaurant operations. We finished the year with three consecutive months of improvements in each of our three internal customer satisfaction scores. Our restaurant teams and field leaders are quickly responding to our recent pivot to simplify restaurant operations, and they are keenly focused on delivering an excellent customer experience. These are early days with this new renewed focus on the customer, but we are proud of how our teams have responded, and it gives us great confidence that we're on the right track. With the change in the focus of our restaurant teams, which includes incentivizing and rewarding an elevated customer experience combined with our strategic initiatives related to digital and marketing Chipotle brands, we're are optimistic about our ability to one, grow our sales, two, improve our margins over time, and three, allow us to invest and building long-term shareholder value. There remains a lot of hard work ahead of us, but we believe in our vision, we believe in our strategy and we believe in our team's ability to continue to drive operational improvements. During December, we recorded positive monthly comp of 14.7%, which includes a 60 basis point benefit for deferred revenue related to Chiptopia. The sales comparisons ease in January as we're comparing to a down 36% versus a down 30% in December of 2015. But the dollar sales trends continued from December into January, and the January preliminary comp improved to 24.6%, which included a negative trading day of over 100 basis points, slightly offset by 20 basis points positive related to Chiptopia. For the first 28 days in January, the comp was 26%. But in the last three days of January, we traded a Friday and Saturday from last year, two of our highest volume days, for a Monday and Tuesday this year, two of our lowest volume days of the week. Of course winter weather in January often results in choppy trends day-to-day and week-to-week, but when we analyze the underlying comp trends, the January sales held up well, especially considering January had the lowest promotional activity of the past 12 months. We'll compare against a comp of down 26% in February and March, so expect the comp will ease accordingly during the rest of the quarter. Our average check declined during the full-year 2016, primarily due to a smaller group size. But the average check began to rebound in December and January, increasing by about 2% compared to last year, which recaptured about two-thirds of our decrease in check. During the fourth quarter, we reported $1.035 billion in sales, which included $6 million of previously deferred revenue related to our Chiptopia promotion. As of the end of the fourth quarter, our trailing 12-month average unit volume was down to just under $1.9 million, and that average volume will now begin to rebuild as our comps have turned positive. Looking to the P&L in Q4, we reported restaurant level margins of 13.5%. Our food costs were 35.3%, which is impacted by elevated avocado prices during October and November, which added about 40 basis points versus Q3. Assuming no significant change in expected food inflation, we expect our full-year 2017 food costs will be in the low 34% range. This includes anticipated cost savings from negotiations with our suppliers and our restaurant managing food costs by reducing waste and optimizing food ordering, food prep and their inventory. Labor costs were 27.5%, during the quarter, an increase of 140 basis points versus last year. Deleverage from lower restaurant sales along with wage inflation of about 5%, combined to negatively impact our labor cost as a percent of sales by a little over 200 basis points. But we started to see better deployment of our restaurant teams including salaried managers, which reduced labor by about 60 basis points. During 2017, we expect labor wage inflation will likely continue at the 4% to 5% level, which would add about 100 basis points or more to labor costs versus the full-year 2016. However, we are targeting to more than offset this inflation through continued better deployment of our salaried and hourly teams throughout the year and from leverage on a positive comp. Through January, we've maintained progress from the fourth quarter, and we hope to continue to build on gains and effective labor deployment throughout 2017. Typically, our Q1 labor as a percent of sales is about the same as the fourth quarter labor percent. However, during Q1 2017, to be sure, we will fully support the higher volume of digital orders expected from our first-ever broad-based marketing of digital. We expect to invest around $2 million in additional labor, or about 20 basis points. So Q1 labor as a percent of sales will be slightly higher in Q4. Once we have the cadence and better predictability of digital sales, our labor matrix should fully fund the hours needed to support our growing digital business. Occupancy as a percent of sales was higher due to sales deleverage, but with positive comps, we expect our occupancy costs in 2017 to decline to just over 7% of sales. Our other operating costs during the quarter were 16.3% of sales, including 4.7% of sales related to marketing and promotional activities. As we head into 2017, we are targeting an overall combined marketing and promo investment of around 3% of sales, although we will consider increasing that investment during the year based on the actual results of specific marketing efforts. The path to restoring our economic model is not a complicated one. But the operational efficiency and cost savings opportunities we've outlined will require great execution by our restaurant teams, led by our field leaders. Our teams are more aligned than ever on priority for 2017. And our first priority is to focus on our customers and provide excellent hospitality to every customer every day. And by simplifying operation to focus on the guests, the very things that lead to a great experience, the proper training and deployment of the restaurant team at the right time throughout the day and the proper ordering, prep and cooking of the right amount of delicious food throughout the day will also lead to better business results. As an example, we often have nearly the right number of hours scheduled for the full day, but too often we are short one crew person during peak lunch, when full staffing is imperative to deliver great throughput. And we have extra crew members during non-peak parts of the day. The overall hours are nearly correct for the day, but the deployment is not yet optimal. This can contribute to a deterioration of service levels during our critical peak hours. So consistently scheduling more effectively throughout the day will result in a better guest experience and better margins. Our G&A costs in the fourth quarter were 6.3% of sales and for the full year were 7.1% of sales for a total of $276 million. We've worked diligently over the past year to effectively manage our overhead costs, while supporting a growing business, strategically realigning resources to the highest priority. Our underlying G&A for 2017 excluding our support staff and employee bonus program and stock compensation is expected to be flat or even down versus last year. But including these items, we expect our G&A in 2017 will increase to around $300 million. After two years of reduced employee bonuses for our support team and no bonuses for the executive team, we expect to return to paying targeted bonuses for all employees in 2017, which will add around $20 million. We expect our stock comp will increase from around $55 million in 2016 to around $75 million to $80 million in 2017. The $55 million into 2016 was artificially low as it included a $6 million reversal of expense related to a performance share award where the shares expired unvested. We are planning to grant a retention bonus in the form of restricted shares for our non-executive support staff. And we also plan to broaden the participation in the equity plans, which combined with the one-time retention grant, will add around $15 million to $20 million to the stock comp. Offsetting these increases in staff bonuses and equity grants, our G&A reductions, including a reduction for our All Managers' Conference, which is held biannually and will not occur in 2017, along with expected reductions in legal and other G&A expenses. Our 2017 incentive equity programs have not been finalized, so these are just estimates at this time. A nonrecurring retention plan based on restricted shares and set of options is a great way to reward the hard-working commitment our people have put forth, and makes it much more likely they will stay and grow with us. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was higher than recent years at 48.7%, and effective tax rate for the full-year 2016 was 40.8%, compared with 38.2% in 2015. And comparing the full-year rates, our higher rate in 2016 was primarily due to higher effective state tax rate. We expect the 2017 full-year effective tax rate to return to normalized level and be in the 39% to 39.5% range, excluding possible volatility in the rate due to the adoption of a new accounting standard related to the tax treatment for exercises in the employee equity plan. During the quarter, we generated $68 million in cash from operations, which funded our $67 million investment in capital expenditure. As of December 31, we maintain $543 million in cash and liquid investments. We also repurchased $67 million worth of stock during the quarter at a weighted average price of $392 per share. For the full year 2017, we anticipate that we will invest about $225 million in CapEx, and going forward we anticipate we'll continue to generate cash from operations sufficient to fund new restaurants, while using excess funds from operations to opportunistically repurchase shares of stock. We faced a number of challenges over the past 14 months. We've also realigned our focus and have made important investments that are now beginning to take hold. We've reevaluated and refocused our operations. We've strengthened our marketing capabilities. We've introduced important enhancements related to digital, and we've begun to capture operating efficiencies. All of which make us optimistic about what we can accomplish in 2017. And despite the challenges, we've never lost sight of our purpose, which is what has made Chipotle a compelling brand and a compelling company. It's an exciting time for all us at Chipotle and we look forward to what our team is going to accomplish this year. Thanks for your time today. We'd now like to open up the lines for your questions. Operator : And our first question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. Jack, just a question about the outlook for this year. I know you gave a lot of the pieces there in your commentary, but last quarter you outlined a goal or guidance of getting to around $10 in earnings per share, and there was no comment around that figure this time around. So could you just talk about whether that number is still in play in your mind? Or whether that's changed since the last time you commented? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yes, David. We had talked about that in the third quarter that we had a stretch goal of $10 EPS during 2017, and a stretch margin of 20%. Those are still in play. We are still shooting for those. We didn't include those only because we discussed those at length at ICR and in other investor conferences. We've characterized those as reasonable, but stretch goals, and so they are still in play. I'd like to think, for example, the 20% restaurant level margin is something that we still expect to get to that sort of a run rate during the year, to make sure that we leverage the P&L as our sales have turned positive now. Make sure we drive operational efficiencies, make sure we do everything we can to restore our economic model. And we believe we can get to a run rate of right around that 20% restaurant level margin. Now will we get to that run rate in time so that we can deliver the full $10 in EPS and deliver an overall 20% margin? That's where the stretch comes in. So it's still a goal that's in play, David, but we're not characterizing it as normal guidance, if that makes sense. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. That's helpful. And then I guess on that last point on the run rate on the margin, can you talk about \u2013 I guess is the idea that that would be the run rate that you would carry over into 2018? Or would you exit the year at a higher rate so that 2018, all else being equal, would be higher than 2017? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, the idea behind the 20%, David, was based on kind of what our current volumes are right now and what we put out there as a comp guidance in the high-single digits is we think that our model has the potential, if we can do everything right from an execution standpoint, that we can deliver around that run rate of around 20%. If we end the year with momentum in comp and we see ourselves continuing to drive positive comps in 2018, that margin has upward potential. I've stated a number of times that if we can get all of our sales back, so if we can return to a $2.5 million restaurant company that we have the ability to fully regain all of our margin up to that 26%, 27% or higher. Now there are pieces of that, that we've been absorbing; for example, inflation. We've not had a price increase in three years. We're not planning any specific price increase right now. But at some point over time, we'll need to pass on some of the higher costs. But we believe we'll be able to do that. And then that along with leverage from the higher sales, that along with better negotiation, that along with better management at the restaurant level and holding the line on the P&L, on individual P&L line item. We still think we have the ability to recapture the high 20% margin range. The most important factor, though, year-by-year, is sales, how much we can build in terms of sales. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : And moving on, we'll hear from Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Just following-up on David's questions, can you guys provide some detail on the expected timeline for your cost control efforts on both the labor and food cost lines? I'm just curious how quickly we can see those benefits. Jack, if there's anything you can tell us about the cadence in which you'd expect to see some of those initiatives pay some dividends for you guys. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, Jeff, it's going to be hard and I really don't want to peg specific quarters. At ICR, we talked about, there's risk levels of everything we need to do to get to that kind of a 20% run rate. Some of the things like avocados have already come down, so that's going to happen. You're already going to see food costs improve during the first quarter. Other items, strategically doing a better job of managing our food costs during the year, that will happen over time. And so to say exactly when we will achieve the full savings that we potentially get at restaurant level, I don't want to commit to that. We could move really quick on that \u2013 quickly on that. And what's likely to happen is that our restaurants are going to move too quickly and portion size might be reduced; holding times might increase so that the quality experience might be reduced. Instead, what we want to do is make sure that we are ordering correctly, we're scheduling the right prep, that we're scheduling people during the right time. And we want to make sure that we're doing that in the right way every time. So I'd rather talk about it as we expect to get to a run rate during the year, Jeff and rather than commit to it in terms of specifically which quarter. And of course, the biggest variable here is the sales building. And so that's been the biggest variable in the last year, the hardest to predict. And so, our ability to recover our margins is highly contingent upon how we proceed in terms of the comps from here on out. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And just one quick follow-up. You were asked about this at ICR, but just in terms of some color on the performance of those TV tests, I think it was in three markets, I think it was November-ish timeframe. But more specifically, where you tested TV, if those markets held on to any relative same-store sales performance in the weeks following the tests. So again, any color you can provide in terms of how impactful those marketing or TV tests have been would be helpful. Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Sure, Jeff. This is Mark. The tests, as I mentioned at ICR, were \u2013 had the results I more or less expected, but it's somewhat mixed. So the results that we saw were basically an outsized level of awareness relative to the media buy, which is typical for television. But it's notoriously difficult to tease apart which part of the comp is a result of which part of the marketing or whether or not it was weather or competitive pressures or whatnot. But what I will say is that we saw a lift in two of the three markets where we tested. We actually saw a negative trend in one of the three markets. That's why I say it's mixed, so it's very difficult to tell the \u2013 to determine these things. So I can't tell you that we necessarily held or didn't hold the comp because it just wasn't big enough over that period of time for us to have seen \u2013 been able to identify the trend clearly. But having said that, it was a relatively small test. So these were three markets and it was just over a month of run for those spots, which really isn't a lot in the world of television. So the way to look at it going forward is as we launch our new campaign in April, there will be a video component, some of which will be on television. And it will be in a much more sustained run of the buy. So that will give us a much, much better sense of how television is performing. But the test as I mentioned, did confirm for me what I more or less thought it was going to do. But it certainly \u2013 that test wasn't a silver bullet. Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Thank you. Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Moving on, from RBC Capital Markets, we have David Palmer. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks, good evening. You've discussed digital ordering, the new marketing, the simplification of operations. If you end up seeing your two-year trend rebuild through the year, what do you suspect will be the biggest reason for that rebuilding? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Well, okay. We've \u2013 I'm not sure, you might get a different answer from each of us. I think it's going to be based on the way we execute in the restaurant delivering a great customer experience, because that includes making sure the restaurant is clean, the line, the serving line is clean, that throughput is fast, that our crew is just providing an overall excellent experience. And when we execute well in the restaurant everything else is going to work well also. We have a better shot at executing digital, and so I think the single biggest thing we can do and the thing that we've been focused on really intently is to simplify our operations, make sure that our teams know clearly what it takes to deliver an excellent customer experience, which they do. That's the thing they do the best. If anything, we've maybe complicated it in the past. We've really de-mystified that, we've uncomplicated it, we're tying incentives to delivering an excellent experience. And I think that's the single biggest thing that will drive our sales during the year. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And if you see certain metrics, what metrics will you look at this year to contemplate a potential price increase? You've talked about that being something you'll contemplate at some point. What will you look at to think about doing that? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yes, David. We would look at our strongest markets, the market that have recovered the best, the markets that weren't impacted in the first place. And we'll look at markets where our operations are strong. And then we'll look at what competitors are doing. We don't have any plans right now, specific plans, but at some point we'll dip our toe in the water, and we'll take a market where there is a very low risk. And when the trends continue to build, and again, we're confident about our teams, we're confident about our pricing power, we're confident about we've got room to do this compared to our competitors. We'll at some point decide to dip our toe in the water and see how well that goes in that market. If that goes well, we'll consider what we do from there. But no specific plans right now to do anything with price. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the comp recovering (30:07), the volumes that you are seeing in both existing and new stores. And on the existing stores, I think as was referenced, a lot of us are inclined to look at two-year trends to control for ease or difficulty of comparison. So with that in mind, it looks like you are seeing a nice acceleration. Is that how you are thinking about the volumes? That you are in fact seeing, if you control for seasonality, a pretty nice improvement versus what appeared to be no real change through last year? And then on the new unit volumes, could you just talk about productivity there? I know in the past you have said when you market around new unit volumes \u2013 or new unit openings you see some improvement. But can you just talk a bit about if that's continued? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yes, I will take the question on the comp, Sara, and then I'll turn it over to Mark on the new stores. The way I would say it is \u2013 I feel good about the comp trend. I feel like we're at least holding our own and perhaps starting to see an inflection point. But most importantly, we are doing this with very little promo. So we've weaned ourselves off of promo. Most of the improvement from December into January was we're going up against a softer comp, but I feel really good about that. And January is not a great month to get a perfect read on the trends. When you look at it day-by-day and week-by-week, you do see some volatility because of weather this year, weather last year. But when we look at it day-by-day, week-by-week, we feel good about what we're seeing, we feel good about holding onto or perhaps building sales from the previous trends. We're also seeing geographically that the Northeast has made a nice move in January, and so they've come back to the pack. And so we talked about the coast being the weakest, but during January, we saw the Northeast really come back to the pack quite a bit. And so the West Coast is still remained to be an outlier, so that was a nice move. And so we'll, Sara, continue to watch what happens during February. And then as the weather clears, but we feel pretty good about the trend so far. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: And then Mark, you want to... Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Sure. Yeah, Sara, with regard to the new restaurants, they're performing right now at about 74% of our regular restaurants, which is an improvement, it got as low as 70% during the crisis, and we do see that the stores that we market are performing better. So now all new restaurants receive marketing at their opening. The other change that we've made with regard to new stores is the way we're choosing real estate, particularly in developing markets. As you know, we have our, or you may know, our real estate markets are categorized into four different categories, knew, proven, established, and developing. And in developing markets, we've reverted to choosing only Tier 1 sites, which we expect will have an ongoing effect on improving the ADS (33:21) in those restaurants. So all said, we're confident in where the new restaurants are headed and in the strategy around choosing those and in marketing. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Next from Bank of America, we'll hear from Gregory Francfort. Gregory Paul Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Just going back to the margin question, maybe looking back at 2010 to 2015, I think you guys held the 26% to 27% restaurant margins on volumes that went from 18% to 24%. Can you talk about maybe why that was? And then as you look forward to 2018, do you need $2.5 million volumes to get to 27% restaurant margins? And how does that play together? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, Greg, if you look back to those periods, depending on what you look at, you're going to see a much different food cost. We in the fourth quarter had a 35.3% food cost. When you look back into those periods you're going to see a food cost somewhere in the 30%, 31% range, there's 400 basis point right there. The other piece is labor inflation. Since 2012, we've had labor inflation totaling about 20%. We have only taken about 5% of a menu price increase in that time, and so we've eaten a couple hundred basis points worth of labor inflation, at least, maybe even more. And so the food cost is higher because of things like, we've had inflation at steak, we've invested in Food With Integrity, things like that, And because we are a little bit behind right now menu pricing, I would say our food is at an elevated level, we've been eating some of the higher food costs over time, same thing with the labor. And so we need a combination, frankly, of getting our volume back, getting back into the $2.5 million range, delivering on some of the efficiencies that we've talked about, and passing on some of these higher costs to our customers. And if we do all that, I think we can get back into the high 20s%. If we only stayed at this current volume, $2 million, or so, I think it would be a stretch to consider getting some margin in the mid-20% range or higher, unless we wanted to just jam a very high menu price increase, but that's never been part of our strategy, because we want to be accessible to the masses. We want to remain affordable. Gregory Paul Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then maybe just to follow-up, like to get to the 20% margins, I guess what sort of volumes do you need to do? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Well, it's within our guidance range. We talked about a guidance range for the year of in the high single-digits. So if we can achieve that kind of a comp, then achieve some of the negotiated savings that we've talked about, and achieve the operational savings, principally in food and labor, we think we can get up to \u2013 in the range of that 20% run rate. Gregory Paul Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Very helpful. Appreciate it. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Greg. Operator : Next question comes from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. Looking at just sort of unit by unit and the initiatives to better manage cost of sales and labor, is there any sort of difference in the success rate you are having for stores that might be seeing more versus kind of less volatile week-to-week or day-to-day sales trends? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: I'm not sure I understand the question, Karen, so unit-by-unit, when we see \u2013 are you trying to link our cost savings initiatives with sales building initiatives, to see if there's a correlation? Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: No, is there a correlation between units that might be \u2013 you had talked about just sort of week-to-week, day-to-day sales trends staying somewhat volatile. Are sort of the cost management initiatives going better or a little bit easier to wrap your heads around in stores that might be seeing a more consistent and less volatile sales trends? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Oh, yeah, yeah, yes. The answer is yes. And the volatility is not unit-by-unit; it's more market-by-market based on geography. But yes, it's a lot easier to manage food and labor \u2013 labor especially when you have predictability. And so when you have volatile weather, we have a snowstorm one day, your tendency is to probably have too many people on the staff and certainly even send people home. But generally, you are going to have deleverage, you're going to have excess labor, maybe excess food, although we don't usually \u2013 we have multiple deliveries a week, and so we don't usually have a problem unless we are closed because of a snowstorm for multiple day. But there's question about it. When we have predictability of the sales, we can do a better job of managing things like labor. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Karen. Operator : Next from Morgan Stanley, we have John Glass. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Thanks very much. First, in your plans to roll out and accelerate digital, does that include activating that second line you've talked about? And maybe I'm having a hard time imagining it, but is it the kind of thing where you'd have to set it up for peak periods, staff it, and then break it down when it gets quieter? Or do you not need that second line, that's not really part of the plan for the first phase of digital? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: I'll start with it, and then Curt may want to add on. John, a second make line is a huge part of it. It's a critical part of it. We have the second make line in most of our stores, some 90-something percent. I don't have the exact number. It is underutilized in a lot of our stores. In the 1,200 stores that we've already rolled out smarter pickup times, all of those stores already have a second make line specialist, a takeout specialist. We rolled out specifically to those stores first because we knew that they were staffed. We already knew that they have a skill and already the habits of using that second make line and executing well on the second make line. The stores that are going to roll out next week are the lower-volume stores. They don't necessarily have a takeout specialist, a trained takeout specialist. The $2 million investment that I described, that is an investment in labor for those teams to open up that line. It is going to be in excess of \u2013 kind of an advanced investment because if the sales \u2013 or as the sales come, our labor matrix will fully fund and fully allow those hours and we'll have normal margins. But we don't want to wait for the sales, execute poorly and then say, oh, we better start adding some labor. So we're going to front-load that a little bit, invest some extra labor in those stores. And then we'll be able to adjust. If stores stay low volume, we'll be able to adjust and make sure that we have the appropriate amount of labor. But we're optimistic that we're going to see additional digital second make line sales in all of our stores, and that will justify the labor investment that we're making in February. And it'll be fully part of the labor matrix. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And if I could just follow-up, can you just refresh our memory from last year first and second quarter when you were doing more promotional activity? Were all transactions accounted for in comps or were the free burritos not recorded in the top line? And then was all the cost associated with that, was that all in the other operating expense line? Or was there anything else, for example in food costs, that related specifically to those promotions? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, John, when we have promotions, none of that would be in the sales because we would \u2013 it would be free. You would see the entire cost of that. So we would take the costs related to the food that we're giving away, all of that would be other and that would be in promo. And so for example, when we talk about 4.7% of sales in the fourth quarter being marketing and promo, the promo part of that is buy one, get ones or free chips and guac and things like that. So that's how you'd see the pieces. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: But to be clear, you wouldn't record a transaction if someone came in and got a free burrito? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yes. We would record our transactions. So when you saw us report last year, if we did a, say, a \u2013 where transactions outperformed sales, that would be because if you came in and you got a free burrito, we would count you as a transaction, yet there would be no sales. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, John. Operator : Moving on, we'll hear from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. Just a quick question on the Northeast and the improvement there. I think you might have done some leadership changes in the Northeast as well. So if you could maybe talk about what you think the causal elements have been in the Northeast. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, it's \u2013 I don't know yet, Sharon, whether I can attribute it to that. I'm very confident in the team out there, and I'm very confident that they will drive not only operational savings and customer experience improvements and that will lead to better sales. And so we may be seeing some of those early dividends. It may also be just a little volatility with the winter weather, but it looks pretty good to me. It looks like they closed the gap in a pretty meaningful way. So I'd like to say that yeah, the folks out there, even though they've only been out there a couple months, that they're already making a difference. But I know they still got their work ahead of them. But I'm optimistic that this is the right team. They are some of our top proven leaders that have gone in other markets and done a really fantastic job of hiring great people, training them and delivering a great experience. So it probably is some early dividends on that, Sharon, but it's really hard to tease out how much is that versus how much is just other factors. Operator : All right. And moving on, we'll take our last question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thank you very much. First, Jack, just a very basic question. I even apologize for asking it. The first quarter, for a lot of different reasons \u2013 the year-ago comparisons, the promos, the closed store, leap day \u2013 there's a lot of things that make the first quarter unusually difficult to predict from a comp perspective. And I know you've given full-year guidance and you don't typically give a quarterly guidance. But with you having access to all the data and just seeing the overall trend in customers, is it fair for me to ask somewhat of a comp range for people to expect in the first quarter because I fear expectations might be a little bit all over the place? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Well, it's fair to ask but we're not going to give it. We're thinking about building this business over more than just a quarter at a time. We're focused on running great restaurants. We're focused on the customer. We're focused on digital; focused on brand marketing and focused on restoring our economic model. So to breakout prediction quarter-by-quarter and then being defined based on those quarter-by-quarter predictions just isn't really helpful for us right now. So sorry, John. We're not going to do that, but we'll continue to give you updates each quarter. And we'll give you as much insight as we can about what we're doing, how we're doing. And I think that's a better way to discuss the \u2013 how the trends are going. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I completely understand. I thought maybe we could get away with it just for this one quarter. Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: It's always worth a try. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then secondly, if I may, separate, could we talk about the direction of employee turnover, I mean maybe where that \u2013 you kind of peaked in 2016, what's happening with turnover now and if you're starting to see a market change, or I suppose improvement in turnover? And how you think that may be influencing your execution at the store level? Curtis Evander Garner - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Sure. So there's no question that we saw accelerating turnover rates post crisis for a number of reasons that we've talked about in the past. Laying on a lot of complexity to the teams, not \u2013 just a lot of new food safety initiatives, things like this. And so it's complicated for our teams, and that was one of the reasons that there was turnover. I will say, though, that since we have made it very, very clear how we find success in our restaurants now and how we get our restaurants to A and then on to restaurateur. The clarity and the understanding of how to do that has really helped morale. It's palpable. We can feel it in the restaurants. I think our folks appreciate that we've simplified it. I think that in our past, the tools that we had were sometimes more complicated than actually running a good restaurant. So we've really allowed now our folks \u2013 with great training, with a clear path to restaurateur, we've really allowed them to thrive. And so we're starting to see a great morale. And I think this is going to contribute to lower turnover throughout the year. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : All right. And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back to Mark Alexee for any additional or closing remarks. Mark Alexee - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Great. Thanks, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you to discuss our first quarter results in late April. Thanks again. Operator : And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve. Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. In December of last year, I returned to the role of sole CEO, with a commitment to restoring the simplicity that had made Chipotle so successful. Since December, we've implemented sweeping changes throughout the organization, nearly all of which are aimed at dramatically improving the guest experience. At the core of these changes was the revamp of the Restaurateur program. Restaurateur is the elite status bestowed upon our very best managers. Over the years, the Restaurateur program had become overly complex and laden with a vast array of esoteric concepts and abstract measures that prevented our teams from running their restaurants well and, frankly, didn't focus on the customer or reward great, sustained performance. By refocusing the entire program on five understandable measures, we have been able to quickly align our entire company around running great restaurants and delivering an excellent guest experience. We still have work to do but I'm very proud of our teams and I'm incredibly excited by the changes I'm already seeing. And we're beginning to see some very tangible results. Through the first three months of the year, we've seen positive sales momentum and improvements in our key operating metrics. We generated revenue of $1.07 billion in the first quarter, an increase of 28.1% compared to the first quarter of 2016 on comparable restaurant sales growth of 17.8% and opening 57 new restaurants. These strengthening sales trends and improved operational execution generated diluted earnings of $1.60 a share. Our better performance for the quarter was due to a combination of factors including the continuing simplification of our operations; a relentless focus on the guest experience; thorough and ongoing crew and manager training; improved execution of digital ordering; increased marketing and improvements in customer sentiment; and a continued focus on serving safe, wholesome and delicious food. Our restaurant teams and field leaders are now focused on achieving a few straightforward and impactful goals. We eliminated dozens of needlessly complex measures and tasks, freeing up more time for training, hiring, marketing and customer service. And we restructured our bonus program for restaurant managers and field leaders to focus on five key metrics that are easily understood and that are within the control of our managers and field leaders. We're already seeing this translate into decreased turnover, better customer service scores, better digital sales support, labor efficiencies and improvements in other key performance metrics. We anticipate that we will see continued improvements in these areas over time. Our teams are also stepping up to support the increased digital order volume in our restaurants. Through the first quarter, our online sales have increased 53.5% over the prior year and we have set all time digital ordering records. Much of this improvement is related to the implementation of our smarter pickup times technology, which dynamically assigns pickup times based on transaction volumes in conjunction with our teams' commitment to providing accurate and on-time digital orders. As many of you are aware, we will fulfill our digital orders from a second dedicated make line in the back of each of our restaurants. These second make lines are led by crews specifically trained to prepare digital orders. Orders on the second make line do not impact throughput or our ability to provide an excellent experience on the main service line. We're excited about the incredible potential of digital ordering and confident in our teams' ability to fulfill these digital orders. Even though much of our attention was dedicated to simplifying our business and strengthening the guest experience, we never lost focus of our commitment to making better food made from whole unprocessed ingredients accessible to everyone. During the quarter, we completed a multiyear journey to remove additives from our tortillas. Chipotle is now the only national restaurant brand to use no added colors, flavors or preservatives in any of the ingredients used to prepare our food. All of our food is prepared using 51 real ingredients, the recognizable high-quality ingredients that you can find at grocery stores or farmers markets. While many other fast food brands have been busy upgrading their menus by replacing artificial ingredients with friendlier-sounding industrial additives that serve the same purpose, we're committed to serving only real ingredients in our food. But our commitment to better ingredients goes well beyond the elimination of industrial additives, often labeled as natural flavors and colors, and it's a commitment that started 24 years ago. Chipotle has long been a pioneer in serving better quality ingredients, including the use of local and organically grown produce, dairy from cows raised on pasture, and meat from animals raised without hormones or antibiotics. Additionally, none of the ingredients used in Chipotle's food have been genetically modified. No other national restaurant brand is as fully committed to making better food made from whole unprocessed ingredients accessible to everyone. I'd also like to provide an update on the dessert we mentioned last year. We have continued to develop two desserts which we'll begin testing later this month. The one that I'll tell you about today is a traditional Mexican dessert called bu\u00f1uelos, which is fried tortilla strips with honey, cinnamon and sugar. The bu\u00f1uelos will be served with an apple caramel butter dipping sauce. Bu\u00f1uelos are simple to make using our existing equipment and require us to add just a few additional ingredients. They're delicious and complement our menu nicely. I'm as optimistic as I've ever been since starting Chipotle nearly 24 years ago. Since last fall when I acknowledged that many of our restaurants were not meeting my expectations, we have made incredible progress. The guest experience is improving, and our crews are energized and engaged. I want to thank the teams who are working hard every day in our restaurants for embracing the changes and elevating the Chipotle experience for our customers. We still have much work to do, but we have the right team, the right strategy and a commitment to seeing it through. Our teams are excited, and ultimately, our customers are the ones who will benefit most. I'll now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. We've always worked hard to differentiate our brand based on our commitment to making better food made with whole unprocessed ingredients available to everyone. We carefully constructed a brand's narrative about our commitment to serving better food, which resonated with our existing customers and helped draw new customers into the brand. We often relied on non-traditional forms of marketing, including entertaining films, TV shows and events like our Cultivate Food and Music festivals to build the brand narrative. Using this type of marketing, we were often able to break through to consumers even though we generally spend less on marketing than our competitors. But our desired brand narrative was disrupted in 2015, and that required us to shift our approach. First, we elevated our promotional activity, which drew customers into our restaurants. Next, we applied more resources to traditional advertising so we could reach millions of new customers. Now, during the first months of this year, we have returned to marketing the benefits that differentiates Chipotle from the competition. While we don't normally advertise during the first quarter, our strategy this year is to advertise throughout the entire year. During the first quarter, we continued to run the Ingredients Reign campaign which portrayed animated ingredients as royalty in a world where ingredients rule the land. That campaign ran in digital, social, outdoor, radio and in video and on television in some markets. We also promoted digital ordering and catering during the quarter with positive results. Ingredients Reign proved to be effective in helping to restore the image of our brand by focusing on our high-quality ingredients. Earlier this month, we launched our largest-ever advertising campaign, As Real as it Gets. The campaign features outdoor, radio, digital video and online ads and social media advertising, and for the first time, national television. The ads use a playful, humorous tone to reinforce Chipotle's commitment to using only real ingredients. It's much too early to evaluate the overall success of the campaign, but initial results indicate that it's performing well, especially with consumers who are familiar with Chipotle. The campaign is scoring high marks for humor, and consumers find it aligned with our brand image. Most importantly, the campaign is working to restore our desired brand narrative. It's also important to note that the campaign has only just begun. The digital and social components of the campaign will begin reaching their full levels this week. During the quarter, we also launched an unbranded television show for kids called RAD Lands. The show, designed to educate kids about where their food comes from and how it is raised, debuted through the Apple iTunes Store where it reached the top five most downloaded children's show on iTunes. Through a partnership with Discovery Education, a leading provider of digital content for K-12 classrooms, RAD Lands episodes will be paired with lesson plans and activities and will extend the reach of the show to more than half of U.S. classrooms, making it available to 4.5 million educators and more than 50 million students. The results of our marketing activities has been a steady inflow of new customers, a strong 18% conversion rate from the first visit to regular customer and ongoing improvements in customer sentiment. During the quarter, we saw increases in admiration, helpfulness, taste and ingredient quality perceptions. Some of these measures are now at or above levels from 2015. We also saw strong increases in friendly and fast service and restaurant cleanliness measures. As we look forward to the rest of the year, we will continue to use a mix of marketing programs designed to drive traffic and build loyalty with our customers. We will continue to advertise throughout the year. We will use selective promotions to drive traffic. And this summer, we will launch a non-traditional music-based marketing program featuring our 51 ingredients. Additionally, a significant portion of our marketing budget is dedicated to driving digital sales and catering throughout the year. These marketing programs, combined with steadily improving customer sentiment measures and continuously improving restaurant operations, give us confidence that we will drive increased customer visits and loyalty throughout the year. Before I turn the call over to Jack, I'll provide an update on our development efforts. Our real estate pipeline remains robust, and we are on pace to meet our restaurant-opening goals of 195 to 210 for the year. More importantly, sales volumes for our new restaurants are improving, with restaurants in their first year of operations generating sales in the $1.4 million to $1.5 million range, with the most recent new stores trending even higher. As we move through the year, we will continue to open a larger percentage of restaurants in our proven and established markets where we've already built strong loyal customer bases. We are also opening more NCAP restaurants that tend to have lower average investment costs, a combination of stronger new restaurant sales, and lower average investment costs should contribute to improving our overall return. I will now turn the call over to Jack. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. I want to start by saying how proud I am of our restaurant managers, our crews and our field leadership for how quickly and effectively they been able to shift their focus to simply running better restaurants and delivering an excellent guest experience. As a result of their efforts, we have seen six consecutive months of improving customer-related scores in each of our three key measures. This is the best consistent month-over-month improvement we have seen since we started tracking these measures and it's a tribute to the hard work and commitment of our field teams. We know that our economic model can only be fully restored if our customers are treated to a compelling experience when they visit, and the results so far are an indication that we're on the right track. While elevating the guest experience is the most important and the most impactful thing we can do right now, we're also seeing our restaurant teams to deliver better fundamentals in terms of running a good solid P&L. Specifically, we're seeing more efficient labor scheduling and management to the best levels we've seen in nearly seven years. We're seeing decreased food waste and reduced inefficiency in controlling food cost, although we still have an opportunity to get even better here. We're seeing more effective management of controllable expenses, such as kitchen supplies and maintenance and repairs inside the restaurants. And we're also seeing the lowest general manager turnover that we've seen in more than eight years. Our GMs have fully embraced and are excited about our new focus, and they're motivated by their ability to thrive in this new environment. It gives us great confidence that by keeping talented leadership in our restaurant, we can continue the momentum we've seen emerge in just a few short months. All of this progress in such a short period of time gives us confidence that our company is headed in the right direction, and we are all committed to continue to do all we can to improve the guest experience. And perhaps most encouraging is that when we visit our restaurants, you can see that our managers and crew are energized and excited about the direction we're headed and the improvements they're driving. And because we have redesigned all of our compensation, including merit raises, promotions, bonuses and equity around this new direction, they know they will be rewarded when they achieve extraordinary results. During the quarter, our comparable restaurant sales grew 17.8%, fueling a 28.1% total sales growth to $1.07 billion. The comp included a small benefit of 60 basis points, or $5.5 million related to deferred revenue recognized from last year's Chiptopia promotion. The comp was primarily driven by an increase of 13% in paid traffic comps over last year. Average check also increased about 4% related to increased group size, and our catering comps rebounded significantly from last year. The sales dollar trend improved nicely in February, with the comps on a two-year basis improving to around down 16%, compared to January which was down over 20% on a two-year basis. And while March was affected by winter storms in the Northeast, the two-year trends in March held up at around down 16% as well. April, of course, is impacted by the timing of Easter, but the underlying trends from Q1 excluding the Easter shift are continuing into April so far. Since we are closed on Easter, we will lose one full trading day during Q2, or about 1% on the comp. Our restaurant margins improved in the quarter to 17.7% which included a 15-basis-point benefit related to Chiptopia. Sales leverage contributed 560 points of the improvement in restaurant margins, and sales growth will continue to be a primary driver in improving margins in 2017. We lapped 260 basis points of nonrecurring incremental promo and marketing costs, 100 basis points of nonrecurring lost labor, leverage from supporting promotions in closing our restaurants for a few hours on February 8, 2016, and 100 basis points in food safety related activity that increased food waste last year. We also benefited from better operating efficiencies resulting from simplifying our operations and better restaurant management, which added about 200 basis points of margin improvement. This was slightly offset by 140 basis points of net changes to labor and other costs, including labor inflation. Food costs during the quarter were 33.8% of sales, an improvement of about 150 basis points compared to last year. The decrease is related to improvements in our food handling procedures, both in our restaurants and at suppliers, as we are no longer incurring unnecessary and substantial food testing and food waste. Food cost is also 150 basis points lower than fourth quarter due to dropping avocado prices and improvements in our restaurant operations. Although avocados are relatively lower, we are still operating in a short supply environment for avocados. This is still putting some pressure on our costs and will likely add about 40 basis points in Q2 and even more in Q3. As a result, we are maintaining expectation that full year 2017 food costs will be right around 34%. Labor in the quarter was 26.9% of sales, 400 basis points lower than last year. This 400 basis points improvement is primarily driven by sales leverage, including less labor required to support the heavy discounts and promos from last year. In addition, more effective labor scheduling and improved deployment of managers resulted in about 180 basis points of improvement. When we simplify operations, we free up labor hours that could be redeployed to improve the guest experience. This shows up as improved deployment, better attention to customer service and cleaner, more organized restaurants. The labor leverage and efficiencies were partially offset by labor inflation of around 110 basis points and continued labor inflation is expected. We also added 50 hours \u2013 or 50 basis points, rather, of labor from returning the prep of lettuce and bell peppers back into our restaurants. Labor should improve in Q3 and Q4 as sales increase seasonally, but that will be offset somewhat by incentive-based bonuses for restaurant managers for continuing to elevate the customer experience and continued inflation. So labor will likely be around 26.5% overall for the year. Other operating costs were 14.1% during the quarter, down from 18.6% during Q1 of 2016. Our combined marketing and promo expense decreased 320 basis points compared to last year as we lapped significant promo activities from February and March 2016. Total marketing and promo expense during the quarter was 3.4%. We expect our marketing and promo costs will rise further in Q2 to around 3.6% to 3.7% as we support our first-ever national TV campaign before leveling off in the second half of the year for an overall marketing and promo of about 3.3% for the full year. Sales leverage contributed 200 basis point of improvement in other operating costs. G&A was 6.5% of sales, down from 7.4% from last year. G&A was up $7 million from Q1 last year due to the reversal last year of unvested performance shares. Without this reversal, G&A dollars would have been essentially flat, despite supporting an additional 225 new restaurants. We have closely managed head count and controlled other overhead costs such as travel while sharpening our focus on just the most important priorities. Other fees such as legal expenses are lower as a percent of sales versus 2006 (sic) [2016] (21:07). Our stock-based comp during the quarter was $15.3 million or $7.8 million higher than last year due to the reversal in 2016 I described earlier. We anticipate that stock-based comp for the full year will be approximately $65 million to $70 million, including the special one-time retention award to our employees discussed on the Q4 earnings call. For the full year, we anticipate total G&A expenses to continue to be about $300 million, as incentive-based bonuses are expected to be restored. Our pre-tax income was $74.4 million, and our effective tax rate during the quarter was 38%. The tax rate was impacted by nonrecurring adjustments related to state income taxes and excess tax deduction for stock compensation. Our effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be about 39% compared to 40.8% in 2016. During the first quarter, we repurchased $58 million of our shares at an average share price of $412. We have $144 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization as of March 31. We generated cash from operations of $151 million during the quarter and finished the quarter with cash and investments of $577 million. Earlier this month, we began to test the targeted price increase in a few markets. If you recall, mid-2014 was the last time we increased prices nationally. Since that time, we have absorbed substantial labor and food inflation and our overall costs of doing business have increased dramatically. While we've been very reluctant to pass along any of these increased costs over the last year as we worked hard to fuel our recovery, now with our business beginning to improve we have selected a handful of markets to gauge a modest price increase. We selected markets that were considered low risk by thoughtfully considering each market's sales trends, recent and expected minimum wage increases and competitor pricing. About 440 restaurants were affected and the average increase was about 5%. It's too early to comment on customer reactions, potential resistance or any impact to the comp for the year but we'll evaluate the trial over the remainder of 2017. Carefully studying the consumer response in these markets will help us evaluate and consider eventual increases in other markets, but we will be very patient and we will not be in a hurry to expand the increase to other markets. We know that the best way to fully restore our economic model is to deliver an excellent guest experience in every restaurant every time, and the last thing we want to do is risk interrupting the current momentum of customer visit increases we have worked so hard to earn. Finally, we want to make our customers and investors aware that we recently detected unauthorized activity on a network that supports payment processing for purchases made in our restaurants. We immediately began an investigation with the help of leading cyber security firms, law enforcement and our payment processor. We believe actions we have taken have stopped the unauthorized activity and we have implemented additional security enhancements. Our investigation is focused on current transactions in our restaurants that occurred from March 24, 2017, through April 18, 2017. Because our investigation is continuing, complete findings are not available, it's too early to provide further details on the investigation. So, we will refrain from providing additional commentary now or in the Q&A. We anticipate notifying any affected customers as we get further clarity about the specific timeframes and the restaurant locations that might have been affected. We continue to work toward our stretch goal for 2017 as we previously highlighted and we think these solid first quarter results are a strong initial installment towards those goals. We still consider achievement of the goals for the full year as a stretch accomplishment but we are more confident now that we are on our way to achieving the run rate of those stretch goals over the next few quarters. Continued sales growth momentum is the most important component on this journey to fully restore our economic model and that begins with great execution and an excellent guest experience in each and every restaurant. Our teams are more aligned and more committed than ever on the priorities for 2017 and we're confident that they will continue to elevate the restaurant experience. We're encouraged by our improving financial and operating performance in the quarter but we are fully aware that we still have much work to do. We want to thank all of our restaurant teams and our support teams in the field and corporate offices for their tremendous effort and their commitment to our vision. Together, we will remain focused on restoring the Chipotle brand and business to its full potential. Thank you for your time today, and we'll be happy to open the line for any questions you may have. Operator : Thank you. And our first question comes from Nicole Moore (26:04) from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Unknown Speaker : Good afternoon. So I caught your TV campaign a bunch of times and I hesitate to share it has been on the Bravo channel. But I just wanted to understand which channels you picked and why? How many weeks will you be running this campaign? How are you splitting out impressions? And then kind of finishing out and rounding out the question, how are you measuring the returns? And do you want us to understand this as a short-term initiative or a longer-term strategy? Thank you. Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Nicole (26:40). So I'm glad you're seeing the spots. We're running them at a high level of frequency. In fact, just across the first two weeks, it's about 160 million impressions. In terms of how we're choosing where we run them, they're running against what was primarily considered appointment TV or TV shows that people tend to watch live, like Desperate Housewives. I'm not going to suggest that's what you were watching. But that or SportsCenter or any sort of game. The Voice, we run on. So those types of shows that people are less likely to DVR and then skip the commercials on. And with regard to how the campaign is structured, it runs in two flights. The first one runs now through really through the beginning of July. And then in July and August, we actually run a different type of promotion, which I alluded to in my prepared statements. And then we run another flight of the TV in September and October. But throughout the entire year, there are certain aspects of the campaign that run continuously. With regard to your question about whether or not this is a long-term strategy, this is part of the overall effort to rebuild the brand's narrative and so the type of advertising that you're seeing now really is brand advertising. This is obviously not advertising that's promotionally driven. It's instead brand-building advertising. Having said that, the campaign is multifaceted so the digital components and social components are much more food focused. In fact, all of the online advertising drives to our online ordering site. So it has a lot of different components to it, but this is part of the long term strategy to reengage our customers in the aspects of our brand which make them more loyal while at the same time layering on aspects of the campaign that drive transactions and that drive digital ordering. So hopefully that answers your questions. Unknown Speaker : And just in terms of measuring the return and then I'll hop off. Thank you so much. Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Sure. The return \u2013 we're going to measure this in several ways. So the most traditional way we do it is with pre, mid and post-wave campaign research which we haven't come to the midpoint of the campaign, so we've only got our pre-wave benchmark on that. So that's one form of research. The other is we do user acceptance research, and we've already fielded that. I alluded to some of the results of that in terms of how people are engaging where they're liking the ads. Then of course we look at the sales impact. It's a little bit difficult ,of course, as you know with these sorts of things to tease apart a part of a comp that's directly the result of the campaign and not weather or other seasonality affects, but we'll do our best in terms of studying that. And then a great deal of this campaign is actually using first and third party data to target our customers directly. In those parts of the campaign we're reaching people who we know on a one-to-one basis, so we can actually see them transact as a result of the campaign. So as this unfolds, we'll be able to provide much more data on exactly how effective digital components that were targeted one-to-one were actually performing. Unknown Speaker : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. If I could just ask a little bit about little sales, first of all, in the past you sort of provided a cadence on a one-year basis for comps for the quarter. So if you could maybe talk about February and March? And I think, Jack, you talked about a two-year trend, but maybe just be very explicit on a one-year basis where sales exit in the quarter? What we're referring to in April? And since I know it's early days in the advertising campaign, have you seen since it is the first time you're on TV and I expect you see some immediate impact \u2013 can you quantify what that impact you're seeing early days on the advertising campaign is on sales? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yes. John, I'll take the first sales question. February \u2013 we had a nice step up in February. We already reported January comps were in the 24% range. February and March were going against lower negative comps from the prior year, but both came in at around 14%. Now keep in mind we lost a day in February because of weekday and we picked up a day in Easter, but both months were going up against about a down 26%. And so the most important metric, John, that we looked at is on a two-year basis, how far down are we? And for the first time in really many months we had a significant move from a down about 20% in January, and we were down a little worse than 20% in the fourth quarter, to a down on a two-year basis to 16% in February. We held that in March, and then we're seeing a similar trend into April so far where we knew \u2013 when we do our best to factor out the Easter noise into April, it looks like we're still trending at about a down 16% range. So I hope that helps on sales and the... John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: What is that on a one-year basis, though, Jack? Just to be clear, what's the one-year comp in April, then? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: So April is running, John. If you set aside the Easter compare, it's in the low double digits during April. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: And with regard to the TV, we don't have a direct correlation to sales right now, and it's primarily for the reason I mentioned earlier which is it's very difficult to tease apart which part of the sales comp we're seeing is a result of the television or not. And because this is national, we don't have our normal control markets that we would normally have in order to compare the advertising against markets where we didn't advertise. Having said that, the initial research is showing that we do have increases in consideration and increases in a number of other metrics that would suggest that we're having an impact, but it's only been running for 15 days. So we'll have a much better idea about this after 30 days or more. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. A question on the increase in digital orders, which it's great to hear, success with the new platform. Is there any noticeable difference in comp trends at stores where you're seeing sort of bigger year-over-year increases or just bigger usage to begin with? And against that really impressive growth, sort of going from here, what other areas you're focused on in terms of continuing to refine and improve either at the store level or on the sort of digital platform itself? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yes, I'll take the comp, and then, Curt, I don't know if you want to talk about the digital specifically. Karen, it's too hard to separate how much of the comp \u2013 remember, we're comparing it to significantly negative numbers and we're seeing an inflection point that I described during February. We're not seeing anything that we can specifically point to, to say, okay, of the comp, of the improvement we're seeing in the sales trend, x amount is digital. We know digital is growing at a very fast rate. We know that's taking people off the frontline, and so that's helping \u2013 theoretically should be helping our throughput because we should be having shorter lines. And so we feel like it's a contributor, but to put a specific number on it, we're not able to do that right now. Curtis Evander Garner - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: And Karen, I can add a little bit of color around the roadmap for digital for the rest of the year. We recently made some improvements on both the web and the mobile site to allow customers to customize their meals much like they do in the frontline of our restaurants and have seen a really positive reaction to that. We continue to expand the network of delivery providers that we have, and have seen great growth in that channel. And we'll be introducing catering delivery to more of our restaurants throughout the second quarter. The other big initiative that we still have for this year is a wholesale rewrite of our mobile application to match some of the improvements that we've made on our online site. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I've just got a question and then a follow-up. In your recent proxy filing, you guys revealed some new compensation goals for the executive team, and I think part of the weighting of this is based on same-store sales going forward. And I think the target for the payout is at a compounded annual growth rate of 7% over the next three years. Can you talk a little bit about how this target was constructed? Was it kind of back of the envelope math where that's kind of what you need to get to kind of your goals? Or was it bottoms-up driven? Anything you guys can say about the target in the proxy would be helpful. And I have a follow-up. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yes, Brian, this \u2013 our comp committee put that together, and they had a lot of advice from some outside comp experts. I will tell you the \u2013 there are two components to it. One was the stock price, and that is a significant increase in the stock price where the target equity would only be earned if the stock price achieved a weighted average over a period of time of at least $650. There's a lower payout if you hit below that, but to get the target, you have to hit $650. And then I think it was \u2013 a third of it was the comp. And there were three different targets, 5%, 7% and a 9%, and a 7% would return the company to a very respectable sales level which would have the potential to enable a very respectable and significantly higher margin for the company. And so it would put the company back on track to have some significant EPS growth. And of course, there are higher awards that are available to be earned if we hit a 9%. A 9% compounded over a three-year period would be a significant increase. And that 9% would get us all the way back to somewhere in the $2.4 million, $2.5 million average range. But keep in mind, by the time we get there, we have somewhere in the neighborhood of 600 to 800 additional restaurants at that kind of a volume. So our comp committee put it together, but there was some modeling that would suggest that that would put the company in a very strong earnings situation. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And just to follow up is you kind of talked about getting hopefully to the run rate guidance at some point this year, and I'm assuming what you're referring to is kind of the $10 EPS run rate. The question I have is what then becomes the big opportunity to build earnings power from there? At that point, does the model upside and the earnings power side kind of come from what we just talked about, just continuing to get sales back and the leverage that comes with that? Or is there any significant opportunities outside of restoring sales once you get to the $10 run rate? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yes. The most significant thing, Brian, is for us to recover our sales \u2013 fully restore our sales. And we've saved money. We're doing a better job at labor. We've seen some improvements in some of the miscellaneous line items on the P&L. And to give you a perspective, if you look at the margin that we achieved during this first quarter of 17.8% and if you said, for example, well what \u2013 based on the current way we're managing the business, what if our volume over time does return to a $2.4 million number? If you just take into account the same kind of management, take into account the expected kind of leverage, our margin should improve to about a 23.5% to 24% range. Keep in mind, we've absorbed inflation over the last three years. And so if you, for example, added on a 5% price increase and you saw little or no resistance, that 23% or 24% margin gets to a 27% or 27.5% margin. So that gives you an idea that sales alone with the current efficient way we're managing the business would get us back into kind of a 27%, 27.5% margin for the first quarter. And keep in mind, first quarter is not our best margin quarter. So we feel like in terms of running the business, in terms of managing efficiencies and still staffing for things like, to support the higher volume second make line, we think our teams are doing a fantastic job. So now what we've got to do is continue to welcome people in the restaurant, continue to deliver an excellent guest experience. And if we continue to step forward and fully recover our volumes, our economic model will be in full force. Keep in mind, these margins that I'm talking about, we have 100 basis points of additional, incremental food safety-related costs that we've got in there. And so we would have fully absorbed that and still have margins equal to or perhaps even better than our historic high margins in the past. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, Jack. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Brian. Operator : Our next question is from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes. Hi. A couple questions. One is a follow-up on the stretch targets that you've talked about and the 20% margin. Now that we're four months into the year, could you give a little color on where, versus expectations, the chart you laid out with the build from 2013, 2014 up to 2020, I would guess maybe food costs are not quite as good? Maybe pricing is an offset. But I'm just curious where you might have seen more or better than expected contribution versus what may have disappointed a little bit. And then I had a related question. As you see digital mix increase, are there any kind of additional investments you have to make? I know you've talked, I think, a little bit about maybe kitchen display, back of the house, just to ensure the throughputs there in the second make line. But anything that might need to be done on that side as well to increase capacity. Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yes. Yes. Sara, in terms of the stretch target, the 20% margin, the $10 EPS. In terms of surprises on the positive side, this isn't a direct margin or EPS impact. But I think the thing that we're the most delighted about is how fast we've been able to pivot and focus on the customer and how fast we're seeing every single measure. Every way we measure customer satisfaction, we're doing a better job. And it's month after month after month. And so we thought we could do this fairly quickly, but we thought it would take many more months and our teams are moving very, very fast. And it just goes to show that when we simplified operations, when we define success in a clear way which \u2013 what Steve described as these five key measures of success, our teams, while they're not easy to get there, they're easy to understand. And our teams have mobilized very quickly. And so that's, I think, the biggest surprise overall. I think in terms of \u2013 from a margin contribution, we're really surprised and delighted by the fact that we're doing a way better job scheduling and deploying our people such that we're ready at peak hour. We're ready to support the increase in second make line sales. And yet we're \u2013 in terms of deploying the right number of hours and deploying the right number of managers throughout the day and managing that part of the business, we're the best we've been in seven years. And that happened in a matter of a few months. And so that happened much, much quicker than we thought. We're seeing progress in things like food costs. We picked up a couple basis points just in terms of doing a better job of ordering, scheduling the prep, cooking the right amount of food and managing food throughout the day. We picked up maybe 20 basis points on that. We think there's still another 30 basis points to 40 basis points or 50 basis points left there. And so I wouldn't say I'm \u2013 that we're displeased with that, but we still got work there. But I think we've made nice progress. Probably the only thing that nobody's asked about yet and that we should be further ahead and were not is throughput. Throughput is the one thing that \u2013 it is an important focus of ours and we're doing okay, not great, and so it's something that we're going to have to continue to focus on. We haven't really \u2013 it hasn't been an important focus in the last year and a half, and because we've had high turnover, we have to retrain and really regain this skill. And that's something we're very active in doing right now as we speak. To make sure it's the right focus, that we're doing the right training, and that our folks in the field are executing at a high level. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Sara. Operator : Our next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. I had two questions. Just one on the follow-up on the pricing color you gave. I think we had heard it was 5% increase in maybe 20% of your stores. I'm just wondering, as you read those results, what would be a good response? Maybe how much traffic pushback would you say is acceptable? I'm just wondering what you're looking for when you read that. I know you said you did it in kind of low-risk markets, but I wasn't sure if that was defined as stores that had much better traffic in those markets or whether those markets had tremendously high labor costs and therefore everybody was raising. I guess I'm just trying to gauge the likelihood that you ultimately deem it a success and at what point we would see another significant increase for the rest of the system? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yes, Jeff, historically when we've raised prices \u2013 we haven't raised prices that often and when we track resistance, we track it into different areas. One, we look at transaction resistance; and two, we look at average check resistance. So \u2013 and we monitor both of those. And then in most cases in most markets historically, we've seen little or no resistance. We plan for around a 25% resistance and that would be a combination of resistance on the average check or resistance on the transaction. So if we raise prices by 5%, which we didn't, we saw a resistance of 25% of that, so one-fourth of that. So about one and a quarter. So if we saw that we're only seeing a pass-through of 3.75% or 4%, we would still consider that to be within the range of normal. Historically, we've seen even a better result, in other words less resistance than that, but if we saw something like that, we'd be okay with that. We did pick low risk markets just because we wanted to start with low risk markets, and when we decide that we want to take the next step, I think we'll take the next layer of markets and say okay, this is the next layer from a risk standpoint. And risk does mean what are the current competitive prices, what are the current sales trends, how strong are the trends right now, and what is the cost of doing business in those areas. And those are what we consider to pick the first 440 restaurants and, as we go to the next wave, we would consider those same things. So hopefully that helps in terms of what we're looking for in terms of whether it's going well. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: How long of a read do you think that takes? And is it possible that later, in the back half of this year, you'd pick the next 400 stores for a 5% increase? Or do you really want to get comfortable and therefore we're talking about 2018 or beyond? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: It just depends on what we see, Jeff. I was careful too in my prepared comments to say we're going to be patient because I know as soon as word got out that we did some target increases, there was a lot of excitement about, oh, my god, they're going to raise prices across the system and that's not a knee-jerk reaction that \u2013 that's not how we're thinking about it. If we saw that we went through the next few months, the next three months or four months or so, and we saw really muted or virtually none at all, we'd consider, okay, which would be the next market. And so there is a chance that you might see some markets roll in 2018. I just don't want people to think that it's a predetermined. We've done a 440, and then next we're going to immediately follow that up with another 400 and then another 400. We're going to be a little bit more patient. We're going to be a lot more patient than that actually. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. Two quick questions, I guess. In December, I think you gave some grades for the stores and I think half of them were kind of below par on customer experience. I'm just wondering if you could maybe quantify what percent now or A or B, or if you're actively grading them. And then any update on West Coast trends, Jack? I know that was something that had been lagging. Have you seen any narrowing of that gap? Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: First on the grading, Sharon, I thought and so did the team think that it was going to take quite a while to get our field leaders and managers refocused on a new brand of Restaurateur programs that focuses on very measurable metrics that are customer-facing, the things that affect the customer experience. We expected it to probably take a year to change that culture. It happened much, much faster. The managers and field leaders did an extraordinary job rallying the teams and the restaurants to embrace these new customer facing measures. And the results have been great. We've dramatically improved the customer experience. And while we don't disclose \u2013 I mean these are internal measures that don't necessarily mean much to the outside world, the results though is that our customers are noticing the difference, and it's a big difference and so we're really pleased with the momentum and that's going to continue because these measures are based on things that will be sustainable and so it's very, very good news. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Sharon, on the West Coast, West Coast is still lagging. And if you think about when we look at overall the company on a two-year basis, we're down about 16. The Midwest and Rocky Mountains continue to outperform that, so they're better than the down 16 on a two-year basis. The South and the Southeast are doing pretty well. They're not quite at 16 but they are in the teens. The Northeast \u2013 we mentioned this at the last call, the Northeast had been a laggard and they have closed the gap and so they're more in kind of the teens, maybe the high-teens range. They've made a move, but the West Coast still is in overall, call it, that low 20% range. And so we still have some work to do out in the West Coast but most of this country is coming along nicely. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: That's great. Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Sharon. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Alexee for any closing comments. Mark Alexee - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thank you for joining our call today. The quick news, our Annual Shareholder Meeting will be held next month on Thursday, May 25. After that, we look forward to sharing our second quarter results with you on July 25. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. When I opened the first Chipotle restaurant 24 years ago, I set out to prove that food served fast doesn't have to be a typical fast food experience. I spent hours preparing the freshest ingredients using the classic cooking techniques I had perfected as a chef. When it came time for service, I was able to serve the food I had prepared incredibly fast in a format that allowed my customers to get exactly what they wanted. Fast forward 24 years and Chipotle is still fundamentally the same experience I created in that very first restaurant, but much within the company has changed. As we grew, we had the opportunity to work with our farmers, ranchers, and suppliers to change the way our ingredients are produced. I'm proud of the positive influence we've had on the development of a more sustainable food system in our country. I remain true to my original vision for Chipotle, and am more committed than ever to be a champion for positive change in making real food accessible to more people than ever before. But as we've grown, we have also encountered our share of adversity. Our unprecedented success leading up to 2015 has masked operational weakness in some key areas of our business. The food safety incidents of 2015 revealed that our food safety program needed to be more robust and it became clear that we were focused too much on building cultures that didn't drive the results we were expecting, and too little on the operations fundamentals required to deliver an exceptional guest experience. Upon returning to the position of sole CEO at Chipotle late last year, I committed to fulfilling the promise of dramatically improving the guest experience and making Chipotle the safest place to eat. I'd like to discuss our progress toward each of these goals now. With regard to food safety, we have formed an independent food advisory council comprised of the nation's leading food safety experts to oversee and advise us on our food safety practices. Additionally, I directed our Head of Food Safety, Dr. Jim Marsden, to develop the most comprehensive food safety program in the industry. Jim has implemented a robust food safety program, which includes the implementation of a HACCP food safety program in all of our restaurants. HACCP stands for hazard analysis and critical control point, and we're the only major restaurant company to have such a program; the implementation of a third-party food safety auditing system, all managers earn a rigorous food safety certification; the installation of advanced ventilation purification systems in our restaurants; and the implementation of a rapid deployment team, including food safety experts and nurses in the event that any food safety incident does occur. All of this creates one of the most advanced food safety programs anywhere. However, no matter how advanced our systems are, it is not possible to completely eliminate all risk, and unfortunately, we had a norovirus incident in one of our restaurants in Virginia last week. Norovirus is a common and highly contagious illness affecting nearly 20 million Americans each year and is unrelated to our food supply chain. It's commonly spread within closed environments like cruise ships, schools, and restaurants. We're disappointed that we failed to prevent it from affecting our customers and employees in our Virginia restaurant. We deeply regret that anyone became ill and I'd like to apologize to those who were affected. We quickly reached out to our employees and customers to provide assistance, and to ensure their well-being. Our safety systems are designed to provide very fast detection and rigorous procedures to quickly remedy the situation. In this case, we were able to quickly detect the problem, proactively alert the Health Department and close and sanitize the restaurant. We have isolated the failure that occurred. It was a failure in one restaurant to comply with our procedures used to prevent norovirus. We know that our procedures work when executed properly, but compliance in each restaurant is essential. In order to reduce the risk of this happening again, we are undertaking an additional comprehensive communication and training effort to ensure that every manager and every field leader understands and execute these norovirus prevention procedures, and that they understand that compliance with our procedures is non-negotiable and a condition of their employment. We will continue to build a culture of compliance in our operations through relentlessly training and enforcing adherence to our policies. Beyond my commitment to continued improvements in food safety, I also promised to dramatically improve the customer experience in our restaurants. Core to this was focusing our teams on delivering an excellent guest experience. This included a new measurement and bonus system that rewards our managers and teams on a handful of easy to understand metrics, the majority of which are customer satisfaction oriented. We have increased the number of restaurants meeting our high operational standards, and have reduced general manager turnover. We have also recently implemented a new guest satisfaction survey, and are intensely focused on steadily improving our scores. During the quarter, we hired Scott Boatwright as our first ever Chief Restaurant Officer. Scott comes to us from Arby's, where he was responsible for the success of nearly 2,000 franchised and company owned restaurants. Scott has a very strong vision for creating a compelling guest experience and he's already demonstrated that his expertise will dramatically improve operations inside our restaurants. All our field leaders now report directly up to Scott and we are confident that we will continue to see strengthened operations in our restaurants under his leadership. In addition to strengthening our leadership team and simplifying our restaurant operations, we are now executing with more discipline against a clear set of strategic priorities, which is enabling our teams to pursue innovation projects in a more effective manner. As you are likely aware, we opened the Chipotle Next Kitchen in New York City earlier this month. The Next Kitchen is a Chipotle restaurant where we explore changes to our menu. The Next Kitchen is primarily intended to test the operational impact of potential new menu items. This includes how they'll be prepped, cooked, presented, and served, in addition to the operational implications of the training required for proper execution. While the restaurant is not intended to definitively determine customer acceptance of new menu items, it's open to the public so that we can interact with the customers, while they order and enjoy the new menu items. Once the new items have been evaluated in the Next Kitchen, they may be put into wider consumer testing in various markets to determine customer acceptance. The Next Kitchen is currently serving queso, frozen margaritas, new salad greens served with an avocado citrus dressing, and bu\u00f1uelos, our crispy cinnamon dessert with a Chipotle infused chocolate dipping sauce. I work closely with the menu development team to create the recipes. Each item is delicious and it complements our current Chipotle offerings nicely. I believe they all have the potential to earn a place on our menu, and because of the early operational success we found with our queso offering, we'll expand the test to two markets in August in order to evaluate its customer acceptance. As you know, one of the hallmarks of Chipotle's success over the years has been our focused menu and our commitment to doing just a few things so that we can do them exceptionally well. As part of our larger customer experience strategy work, we're exploring innovations that will appeal to our guests, while being mindful to avoid adding unnecessary complexity to our restaurant operations. Of our last 24 years, there's no doubt the last two have been extremely challenging. But we are emerging as a stronger company. We've built stronger teams, refined our strategy, enhanced our technology, advanced our food with integrity offerings, and are carefully evolving our customer experience with changes to our menu and to our environments. We are doing all this with the aim of creating loyal customers by delivering a compelling dining experience and ensuring that real food, raised with respect, is accessible to more and more people, ultimately creating greater shareholder value. I'll now turn the call over to Mark. Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Our marketing efforts have always included a combination of brand-building efforts and transaction-driving promotions and advertising. The brand-building programs target existing customers and are designed to strengthen brand loyalty. The advertising campaigns cast a wider net and target current lapsed and new customers. For the last year, we have increased all of our marketing activities, first with increased promotional activity, and then with increased advertising. While this increased marketing activity has been effective, it's clear that winning back occasions lost to competitors is going to be an ongoing challenge. The solution to winning back customers is not simply to spend more on advertising or tweaks to the creative approach. To win new customers, attract lapsed customers and increase the frequency of our existing customers, we need to evolve the Chipotle experience and create more compelling reasons for customers to visit. There's tremendous demand for something new from Chipotle, and we are actively working to add excitement to our menu and our environments and to add new ways to order from Chipotle, all while staying true to the core promise of our brand. To accomplish this, we took a comprehensive look at our overall customer experience with an eye toward the future. We carefully examined all the different ways our customers order from Chipotle today, and how that might change in the future. We looked at what our customers order and how single orders, group orders, and family orders differ. We looked at how customers might like to access Chipotle, including in-store physical and digital ordering, out of store digital ordering, dining in, in-store pickup, in-vehicle pickup, and delivery. And we took a close look at the different ways people might like to access Chipotle, including smaller catering formats, family meals, and-grab-and-go options, and, of course, we looked at the menu itself with an eye toward appealing to new customers or to create new options to encourage existing customers to visit more often. From this strategy, we have begun to enhance the Chipotle experience in areas with the most potential. An obvious example of this is the Next Kitchen in New York, where we are experimenting with four new menu items. But other examples include the new digitally-enhanced second make line, where digital orders are fulfilled, which is currently active in 25 New York restaurants. And it includes changes to the design of our existing and new restaurants to optimize them for digital orders, new types of ordering formats, and new menu items. This includes the first ever Chipotle vehicular pickup window that will be opening at an Ohio restaurant this fall. These changes, and especially the changes to our menu, also enhance the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. We know that many of our lapsed customers are waiting for a reason to return to Chipotle and new menu items are an ideal way to spark the necessary interest. New menu items are also ideally suited to advertising, especially the 15-second television spots that make up the majority of our television ad buying. Along those lines, I'd like to share with you the details for expanding the test of queso that Steve mentioned. Now that we have successfully completed the operational test in New York, we will be rolling out queso to more than 350 restaurants across markets within Central and Southern California and Colorado, beginning on August 1. We will measure customer acceptance of queso, during which time we will evaluate a national rollout, which we think could happen as early as mid-September. But the decision for a national rollout is subject to the results of the test that begins August 1. At this time, the other items in the Next Kitchen are still in their operational test phase, but we expect that some of those items may also proceed to consumer testing at some point. Last quarter, we launched our first national marketing campaign that included television. The campaign is called As Real as it Gets, and is focused on the use of real whole ingredients in our food. The campaign consisted of television, out of home, digital, radio, social, and search marketing. The digital component of the campaign was successful in driving 45% of all online orders and 60% of all catering orders during the advertising flight. Based on our research, the first wave of television advertising during the April flight resonated with existing customers, but was less effective at driving transactions among non-customers, even though it scored above industry averages for television effectiveness. Prior to the second flight in May, we updated the creative to feature more appetite appeal, which contributed to a 10-point increase in intended visitation among fast food and fast casual diners who viewed the advertising. But while the feedback on the campaign was positive, we have an opportunity to make the television advertising more effective at driving traffic into our restaurants. In preparation for the upcoming advertising push in September, which again includes significant television advertising, we further refined the ads to include even more appetite appeal and tested the creative approach. We anticipate these ads will drive increased consideration in visitation with new and lapsed customers. In anticipation of successful consumer testing of queso and a subsequent national rollout, we have developed advertising, both for television and elsewhere that features queso. The inclusion of a new menu offering has the potential to significantly improve the impact and traffic-driving potential of the campaign, especially with the television advertising. As we head into the new quarter, we just launched a new traffic driving program called SAVOR.WAVS, working in partnership with RZA, the multi-platinum hip-hop artist, producer, and founding member of the Wu Tang Clan. We created an interactive experience where customers compose their favorite Chipotle order, which SAVOR.WAVS then translates into a unique musical and visual experience based on their order. During the experience, customers see how each of our real ingredients was paired with a musical sound created by RZA. We also invited several well-known artists to create their own order and remix the songs in their style. RZA and the Wu Tang Clan created one of the remixes, all of which are available on Spotify. We are supporting SAVOR.WAVS with an advertising campaign that targets our fans as well as new and lapsed customers through our own social channels, as well as paid promotions that include unique partnerships with Spotify and support from Pandora, SoundCloud, Complex, Bustle, Facebook, and Instagram. And to tie SAVOR.WAVS directly to our continued effort to drive sales, we have included a BOGO offer for consumers that go online and complete the SAVOR.WAVS experience. So far, 2.6 million customers have composed their order within SAVOR.WAVS and earned a BOGO offer. Before I turn the call over to Curt, I'd like to provide an update on our development efforts. During the quarter, we opened 50 restaurants and remain on track to open between 195 restaurants and 210 restaurants this year. I will now turn the call over to Curt. Curtis Evander Garner - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. As we've discussed before, Chipotle has taken a holistic approach to digital. We've made significant improvements to the digital customer experience through the launch of our new ordering website, smarter pickup times technology and most recently, meal customizations, which allows our customers to personalize their Chipotle meal through our digital ordering platform the same way they order in line. We've also improved our staffing and training of our existing dedicated second make lines, which we have in nearly every restaurant, to ensure that digital orders are fulfilled without impacting throughput on the front serving line. And as Mark mentioned, these improvements have allowed us to begin to invest in digital marketing with a clear call to action for digital ordering. This holistic approach has created a digital flywheel that has driven a strong customer response and set records during the quarter. Web ordering increased 52% compared to Q2 2016, while mobile ordering increased 37%, and catering increased 9%. Second make line sales as a percentage of overall sales rose to 8.5%, a new record for the company in terms of sales dollars and percent of overall sales. Our busiest restaurants continue to see the highest sales gains on the second make line, with our top 250 restaurants recording second make line sales at almost 15%, a sign that our flywheel is improving the customer experience in our highest volume locations. Looking forward, we will continue to invest in improving the digital experience for our customers as part of the overall customer experience strategy that Mark discussed. We've recently deployed our new tech-enabled second make line to 25 restaurants in Manhattan and have plans to have approximately 100 of these new second make lines installed by the end of the year. Early results have confirmed that these new tech-enabled lines have as much as a 40% improvement to throughput. We are working through the details of the plan for 2018 and estimate several hundred additional restaurants will receive the new tech-enabled line next year. Additionally, we remain on track to launch a new mobile app this year. This will be the first major release of a mobile app at Chipotle in years, and will contain substantial improvements to the digital experience for our customers, including the ability to pay with a mobile wallet, rapid order and reorder, and integrated digital offers. Customers ordering from restaurants with the new tech-enabled second make line will get enhanced features such as order completion notifications and arrival detection for the vehicular pickup window. While we are in the early days of positioning Chipotle as a leader in digital, we have great momentum and are encouraged by the customer reaction and results we have seen so far. I'll now turn the call over to Jack. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Curt. We continue to face significant challenges as we work to restore customer trust and restore our economic model. The events of the past week have made those challenges even more difficult. But we've made important progress so far this year, and we have opportunity to build on that progress in the coming months. Specifically, we changed how we define and reward success, based on providing an excellent guest experience, which has resulted in improving internal restaurant grades each month since last year. We have the highest percentage of internally rated A restaurants that we have had since we redirected our Restaurateur program. Our general manager turnover is the lowest it has been in more than eight years and our labor deployment is the most efficient it has been in the past seven years. And while we're pleased to see this early progress, we remain committed to continue to elevate the guest experience by investing in the training and development of our restaurant crew and managers. We know there's a strong correlation between restaurants with a strong culture of training and creating an excellent guest experience, and there's also a strong correlation between great training and low turnover at both the crew and manager levels. At our upcoming field leader conference next month, where all of our field leaders throughout the country will gather, the main focus will be around creating a strong culture of training and development in each and every restaurant. We also have the potential to delight our guests with new menu items, such as queso, as Mark discussed, which is the single most requested item our guests ask for. We'll continue to invest in technology to improve the guest out of store ordering, which already is our fastest-growing sales channel, as Curt discussed. And finally, after absorbing inflation in our economic model for more than three years now, we believe we have the ability to recover some of that inflation through price increases, as the increase we have taken so far in about 500 restaurants has seen little resistance. And I'll talk more about that in a few minutes. During the second quarter, our comparable restaurant sales grew 8.1%, fueling a 17.1% total sales growth to $1.17 billion. The comp was primarily driven by an increase of 5.3% in paid traffic comps over last year. Average check increased about 2.8%, mainly as a result of fewer promotions, primarily BOGOs from last year. The news surrounding a cyber-event had a temporary impact for a few weeks, and overall for the quarter had an impact of around 30 basis points to 50 basis points on the comp. In markets where we increased prices, the overall resistance was less than 20%, and most markets saw no resistance at all. This gives us confidence that we do have pricing power with our existing guests in those markets. Remember, we selected the first group of market primarily based on identifying them as low-risk markets where the negative sales impact in 2016 was less severe, where competitor prices were generally high, and where we expected the resistance would be low. We are currently reviewing the next year of restaurants for a possible price increase using the same risk profile analyses. While we would like to execute the price increase on the next tier of market sometime in the fall, the exact timing will depend on the timing of a possible queso rollout and the consumer sentiment and visit habits following the events of last week. Through the first two and a half weeks of July, our average daily sales levels have held steady to June and the two-year comp trend was holding at the same level as Q2. As a perspective, with last year's Q3 comp of negative 21.9%, maintaining the same two-year comp trend would require a Q3 2017 comp of a positive 5.6%. It is too soon to know what enduring impact last week's events may cause, if any, but comps have been negatively affected by about 5.5% on average over the last several days. Of course, our hope is that the impact will fade over the coming weeks, and that the marketing and buzz around the queso expanded test will change the narrative and encourage our guests to quickly return to their previous visit frequencies. While at this early stage visibility is limited, we have reiterated our full-year comp guidance of high single-digits, which assumes some recovery of the impact from last week, along with the possibly of a queso rollout and a likely menu price increase in Q4. Our restaurant level operating margins improved in the quarter to 18.9% from 15.5% in the second quarter of 2016. While sales growth remains the most important lever to restoring our economic model, we continue to look for opportunities to find cost savings through better contract negotiations with our suppliers and improved controllable costs inside the restaurants, especially with our food costs and our labor management lines. Our margins are not quite at the 20% target we had set late last year, but we are within striking distance and can get there with help from normalizing avocado prices and by building greater comp momentum. Food costs during the quarter were 34.1% of sales, mostly in line with last year. The short supply environment for avocados continue to pressure our food costs by about 140 basis points compared to last year and by 70 basis points compared to last quarter. These higher avocado costs mask our cost savings achieved related to reduction in food waste and resulting from changes in food safety procedures and lower paper and packaging costs. We also benefited from higher rebates at the end of the quarter tied to an agreement milestone that contributed 15 basis points. And this benefit was not anticipated in our prior guidance for the second quarter. On a sequential basis from Q1 to Q2, our food costs increased 30 basis points from 33.8% to 34.1% due to higher avocado prices. We are already starting to see some minor relief in pricing as we transitioned seasonally from California to Mexico in July along with higher supply than expected from Mexico. If avocado prices continue to improve, we believe that our food costs can improve by about 40 basis points in Q3 and move to the low 33% range in Q4. And that is before the impact of any possible future price increases. Our labor costs in the quarter were 26.2% of sales, or a 160 basis point improvement over last year. The combination of sales leverage in our peak seasonal sales period and better scheduling and deployment of labor contributed to year-over-year decrease. These efficiencies were offset by wage inflation of about 4% and we believe that that inflation will continue at least at this level through the back half of the year. Other operating costs were 14% during the quarter, down from 15.2% during Q2 2016. Excluding marketing and promo costs, other operating expenses improved by 50 basis points. Our combined marketing and promo expense was 3.7% in Q2 and decreased 70 basis points compared to last year as we lapped a high volume of promotional offers related to direct mail in Q2 2016. For the second half of the year, we currently expect our marketing and promo costs will ease slightly to about 3.1% of sales. On a sequential basis from Q1, underlying other operating expenses, including marketing and promo, improved 35 basis points due to leverage on higher seasonal sales, but was offset by 25 basis points due to higher advising and promo in Q2. To add a bit more perspective on other operating expenses, as you know, the line item consists of about 20 individual expense line items. In addition to marketing and promo, some of the other larger line items include bank fees, which actually grow faster than sales, as credit card sales continue to grow at a faster rate than cash sales; and utilities, which are generally fixed and will move with energy cost changes and seasonal usage, but typically not move with sales fluctuations. All other components are under 100 basis points each, and include items such as employee meals, M&R, insurance, et cetera, and generally are semi-fixed in nature. These grow in absolute dollars as we build additional restaurants, so sequentially from Q1 to Q2, excluding marketing and promo, other operating expenses grew 6%, or $6.8 million to $121.5 million and were 10.4% of sales. This $6.8 million increase is comprised of a $2.4 million increase in credit card fees, about $1.7 million increase from net new stores with the remaining $2.7 million increase arising from the semi-fixed nature of the remaining line items. So prior to adding new stores to the base and prior to the increase in credit card fees, our underlying leverage on the other operating expenses would have been about 70 basis points from Q1 to Q2, but including the new stores added and the higher credit card fees, the leverage was about 35 basis points, again not counting changes in marketing and promo. To add a bit more clarity, the nature of these line items sometimes results in quarter-to-quarter volatility, such as with insurance adjustments or changes in energy costs and often these moves go both ways among the line items and often offset each other. And when they don't, we will point out unusual non-recurring increases or decreases. In the second half of the year, these other operating expenses, including marketing, will continue to grow in absolute dollars with seasonal expenses like utilities and as we continue to open new restaurants. I hope this discussion provides better clarify for how sales leverage works for this relatively small collection of often misunderstood line items. G&A was 6% of sales, down from 7.1% of sales last year. G&A dollars were down $700,000 from Q2 of last year, driven by lower legal expenses and maintaining a disciplined approach across the rest of our underlying G&A costs. These reductions were offset by increased employee bonus accruals and stock comp expense. For the quarter, stock comp was $19.2 million and we continue to expect full-year stock comp to be approximately $65 million to $70 million. In Q3, we'll also hold our biennial field leadership conference, which will cost about $1 million. For the full year, we now expect G&A to be slightly lower than previous guidance, in the $290 million range, which is down from prior expectations of $300 million for the year. However, I would note that we have not accrued any possible liability related to the cyber incident from earlier this year, and we also haven't included any possible liability in our G&A estimate for the rest of the year. During the second quarter, we reported a slight gain on the disposal of assets due to $3 million related to proceeds on the disposal of a ShopHouse, along with a reversal of ShopHouse straight-line rents. For the second quarter, our effective tax rate was 38.1%, and for the full-year, our effective tax rate is expected to be about 38.4%. The Q2 tax rate was impacted by non-recurring adjustments related to state income taxes \u2013 tax deduction for stock compensation. This new effective tax rate is lower than the prior year of 40.8%, as our pre-tax income has improved. During the second quarter and through yesterday, we repurchased $77 million worth of our shares at an average share price of $423. We have $167 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization as of yesterday. We generated cash from operations of $93 million during the quarter and finished the quarter with cash and investment of $569 million. Our entire organization is aligned behind supporting an elevated guest experience. We're committed to creating a strong culture of training, simplifying our operations, pursuing innovation that will lead to a better guest experience. Creating and sustaining sales momentum is the most important lever for restoring our economic model, and that begins with great execution and delivering an excellent guest experience in each and every restaurant. We're grateful to all of our team members for their hard work and commitment and we're confident that strong execution of our strategies will result in long-term profitable growth, all while fulfilling our mission of preparing better tasting food made from real ingredients for our guests. Thank you for your time today and we'll be happy to open the lines for questions you may have. Operator : The first question comes from Jason West with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah, thanks. I guess, Jack, just starting off, I just want to clarify some of the comments you made about recent trend, just so we're all on the same page. So, when you said the first two weeks of July had a similar two-year to 2Q, can you just clarify what that implies on a one-year? Just I'm not sure which two-year stack you're using there. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, well, the two-year stack, I think it would be better to clarify what the two-year stack is. If you do the geometric two-year, in the second quarter our comps were in the down 17.4%, 17.5%. To maintain, looking at the first couple weeks of July, we were at that same kind of two-year rate. The one-year is going to be lower, Jason, because we're going up against Chiptopia, you've got the holiday. We did pick up a little bit because we opened for part of the day on the July 4th, but I think the way to think about it is on a two-year trend comparing back to 2015, first couple of weeks were right in line with June and right in line with the rest of the second quarter on that two-year, down about 17.4% range. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, so the first two weeks of July last year on a one-year, what would that have been? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Well, on a one-year, like the second week, for example, it was the best week we had during, I believe the entire quarter, because remember that was the kickoff of Chiptopia. And so, we left the quarter, or the entire quarter, and the second quarter was down 23.6%. We were in for that second full week, not counting July 4, we were like in the down 20% range. And that was, I believe, the best or near the best week of the entire third quarter. So, that's why the one-year is going to be lower, but that's because of comparing against some of the early Chiptopia returns. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And then July commentary on the first two weeks does that include the benefit of being open longer on July 4? Or is that... John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, the relatively, Jason, in terms of the week and two weeks, relatively modest impact. And we were only open for part of the day. And I would say even for the hours that we were open, our hourly sales were less than normal. It was the first time we opened on July 4. We're not sure how many people knew we were open and people are not in their normal trading pattern. So, it had an impact, but not a very significant impact on the week or the two-week comp. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And the last thing for me is just the comment that trends have been slow the last few days, down 5.5%, is that \u2013 you mean it slowed by 5.5 points from where you were running? Or are you saying it was down 5.5%? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: No, if you go back and look at like the last few Mondays, look at a normal Monday for the last two weeks, a normal Sunday, normal Friday, we're down from where we were running by 5.5%. So, it does not mean a negative 5.5% comp. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. I'll pass it on. Thanks. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray : Thanks, good afternoon. I just wanted to ask about the latest round of TV marketing. It ended with great money, yet you have ongoing BOGO offerings. So, what's the right balance between those messages and why? And I was just specifically wondering basically what's the brand proposition or value messaging at this point? Thanks. Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Nicole. So, the campaign that we ran in the spring actually included actually three different waves of television across one flight. So, what happened across those three waves of TV is that we actually changed the creative. So, you may remember actually the campaign started with the comedian spots, and those were typically longer spots of 30 seconds. But, as the campaign went on, we optimized it to ads that included more appetite appeal and it eventually ended up running predominantly something that we called the burrito assembly spots, which is the one you're referring to, the bring money spot. But all of these ads are part of the real ingredient marketing platform that we have. You know, I think as you're probably aware, this spring we accomplished the ultimate removal of the very, very last preservatives and any other industrial additives in our food, leaving us with 51 real ingredients, all of which you could just go buy at the store and you'd recognize as a real ingredient. So, the campaign across all the different facets of it is built on that platform. You'll see, though, different manifestations of it. On the digital ads and a lot of the online work that we do, we have an opportunity to be a little bit more descriptive and create a more immersive experience. When you're on television, and particularly when you're on television in these 15-second formats, there's room for some appetite appeal and then we get some of the brand voice into it. What I mentioned in my prepared remarks is that we've continued to refine the creative. I mentioned that that entire flight, although it improved from the beginning to the end because we morphed the creative, still has the opportunity to be way more effective in terms of driving the traffic into the restaurants. So, the creative that we're going to be using for the upcoming flight of TV, which begins in mid-September, has gone even further on the appetite appeal side. And, as I mentioned, if we decide to roll queso nationally, will include queso. It also includes a comedic tone, although it's much more oriented toward the appetite appeal. So again, the brand proposition is that Chipotle serves food that's delicious but made with real ingredients in a way that no other brand does and it manifests itself in different ways, depending on the actual medium that we're using. But hopefully that answers your question. Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. Obviously, a significant amount of robust drivers you guys are implementing, but Steve, what gives you the confidence that you guys have done enough here, just damage control, that last week's events just won't set off a similar sales pattern that persisted through 2016? Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Well, so, Andrew, we need to ensure that we do a much, much better job after the events of last week, and we take this very, very seriously. We conducted a thorough investigation and it revealed that our leadership there didn't strictly adhere to our company protocols. And we believe someone was working while sick. And we took swift action and made it clear to the entire company that we have a zero policy for \u2013 zero -tolerance policy for not following these protocols. Our protocols are excellent. I mean, these protocols were designed by leading experts on our food safety council and in-house by our food safety expert, Jim Marsden, and \u2013 but you need to ensure that you're following the protocols. They work. When followed, they work perfectly. So, I'm thrilled that we have Scott Boatwright joining us. He's already brought a really high level of discipline and greater focus on the fundamentals of operating great restaurants. Something that we're getting better at, we were in the past, perhaps too focused on softer cultural kinds of things, but he's brought back a real rigor and I'd actually like to invite Scott to share his thoughts on this. Scott Boatwright - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Hi, Andrew. Steve's right, we conducted a thorough investigation of what transpired here in Sterling, and we found out it was very clear that procedures were not being followed as prescribed by Chipotle's rigorous standards. I assure you that we've taken swift action on what's transpired there and making it clear to the entire organization that not following our procedures will have severe consequences. Beyond that, we're putting in stronger measures in place to uncover when our procedures break down, and we will \u2013 we have and will continue to reinforce our zero policy \u2013 zero tolerance policy to our standards. I've talked to Steve and the officers here, and what I plan to bring to the organization here at Chipotle is a maniacal focus on the fundamentals of our business, more specifically, ensuring the integrity of our training programs to lay a strong foundation for the organization's success. This type of rigor and discipline has been absent from the brand for some time and we will re-instill, again, a maniacal focus on how we operate our business and one best way to run a Chipotle restaurant. I will say, after spending several weeks in training in our restaurants since joining the brand, I am inspired by the uniqueness of our offerings, the quality and the freshness of our products, and the culinary skills that go into preparing our foods on a consistent daily basis. I'm also inspired by the wonderful people throughout the Chipotle family, specifically in our restaurants that work tirelessly every day to not only deliver a great and consistent guest experience, but also ensure the safety of our food really nationwide. It's unfortunate that this incident happened on the heels of again what transpired months prior, but I assure you that we will get back to the discipline and the rigor necessary to ensure that we protect our employees and our guests as we move forward. Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC: That's helpful. And just one more for Jack. As we kind of think longer term here, historically, even as kind of the margin sensitivities to different levels of AUV recovery; can you just refresh us on that? Just anything else we should be thinking over those numbers that you presented a few quarters ago, are those still intact? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, they're still intact. We're within striking distance of 20% right now. We're not getting any help from avocados, although avocados has \u2013 the pricing has receded recently. If we can also build some complement, and we do have some exciting new news ahead with technology that Curt talked about with queso. And queso is by far the most requested item we've ever had, and so if we can build some \u2013 complement them, get a break from the cost of avocados, we can push up to that 20% level at this current sales volume. And then as we continue to gain complement them, as we move from just about 2 million to 2.2 million to 2.4 million, we can step-by-step recover our entire economic model. Some of that will require offsetting some inflation. We've eaten inflation now for more than three years, we've absorbed the highest labor inflation that we've ever seen over a three-year period, so that's eaten into the model, but we think that with a little help from avocados, build and complement them, and passing on some of the inflationary costs to our customers we can get our full margin back. Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC: That's helpful, thank you. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew. Operator : The next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, good afternoon. Just a question on the sales trends that you were seeing, I guess, before the latest norovirus incident. The two-year comp, or however you want to look at it on a seasonally adjusted basis, looked to be holding very steady, despite a lot of effort to drive improvements in the operations and launch new advertising programs. So, I'm just wondering sort of what your thoughts are on why you haven't seen more improvement to date. Is there anything in your metrics that would suggest you're not making progress in certain areas in the operations? Or if there's something else going on that's preventing that sales recovery? Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: David, nothing that stands out. We can definitely get better at operations. You've heard us say that we spent more time than we should have over the last few years with more of the feel and the culture in the restaurant and not enough in the rigor of great training and good, solid culinary skills and running a good operation such that the restaurants get a great experience every single time. And that's something that we're recommitted to. Scott, as Steve mentioned, as you heard from Scott, is bringing a huge commitment to get those fundamentals back because that's something we're going to continue to work on. But we came to the conclusion recently that our sales did improve. We were down on a two-year basis at about 21% in January and as we closed last year, so we did pick up some momentum to get down to the 17.5%, but we came to the conclusion that we need new news and we think that queso, we think, is going to help us with that new news and we're excited about the tests to come. With that, Mark may have some comments as well about the customer and what it means as well. Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Sure, David, I can add a little bit to it. I mean, one of the things we've encountered, and this has been true really since throughout all of 2016, and we're actually seeing evidence of this in the middle \u2013 beginning in to the middle of 2015 is that our customers really do want to see something new from Chipotle and there's a lot of pent-up demand for this. And in the type of marketing that we do, it's incredibly effective to have something new and exciting for customers to come in and enjoy. And so, we've been up against trying to claw back occasions that were lost to other competitors, of which there are very, very many, of course, now in this category. And as we studied our customers, they fall into several different categories, but within the lapsed categories we have people who are called lapsed defectors and then lapsed rejectors. And when you look at these different types of customers, the majority of these fall into lapsed defectors, so these are people who used to be regular Chipotle customers and now are very, very infrequent at the cadence of maybe once a year or they stopped coming altogether, and these customers, when we talk to them in research, have a couple of primary objectives which are interesting. I mean, one is that we saw boredom as the number one. And second, as no queso. So, we're talking a lot about this one particular menu item, but I shouldn't underestimate how much potential it has, and then when you combine it with some of the other things that we're looking at doing, it really could add a lot of momentum to the marketing programs that we've had. So, I'm very encouraged by all this, so hopefully that gives you a little bit of perspective into why maybe some of our marketing hasn't driven as hard as we would like. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I guess and if I could just follow up on that, if I may. I guess on the whole notion that customers asking for something new, does this mark a change in the philosophy at Chipotle? Because, I guess, the business was built around sort of simple and focused execution, as you mentioned in your prepared remarks, Steve, and now we're talking about new products and putting advertising behind them, which sounds a lot more like a traditional approach in the restaurants category. So, I just wonder, I guess, if you could comment on whether you think there's a new reality at Chipotle where we're going to need to see new menu items to drive traffic on a longer-term basis. Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Sure. Well, so these new menu items come out of a desire to look more strategically at what Chipotle might look like in the future, not only menu item-wise, but how we cook in the kitchen, how our restaurants are set up, how the digital experience might be part of it, all sorts of things. And the Next Kitchen has told us a lot about what the future might look like and it's very, very promising. You know, when I've said over the past many years that we have a desire to keep things simple so that we can execute at a high level and that our menu didn't grow, it was really a desire to make sure that we did execute at a very, very high level. Let me give you an example of an innovation in the Next Kitchen that actually has created something that's much more appealing and much easier for the crews to execute and much faster, and that is margaritas. For years, we individually mixed margaritas and shook them per order, taking a couple of minutes per customer. We installed a frozen margarita machine where we still use fresh citrus and make the mix ourselves in the restaurant, but then dispense it out of a frozen margarita machine, so it's actually preferred by our customers and operationally it's much easier. And so, we really need to be open to exploring ways where we can do things differently. You know, queso is an interesting one in that the main reason we rejected queso in the earlier days is because we couldn't come up with a recipe that didn't have a bunch of the kinds of ingredients that we don't want to serve, the kinds of ingredients that are really part of processed food. And so, we came up with a recipe that we like. It's a clean recipe and it's a delicious recipe, and operationally, queso is very, very easy for our teams and for our customers. So, we're going to put it in a couple of markets and test it, and I think we're going to be happy with the results. We're going to test other things, too, David, but we'll test these things in the Next Kitchen with an eye toward operational ease, to make sure that we can offer the very, very highest quality experience. I will also add that our training in the past was not as perhaps \u2013 it wasn't specifically designed for new menu items, and since we've made advancements in our training technology, I think we're much more prepared to try new stuff. One of the tools that we have now available in our restaurant kitchens for training is a digital system and a tablet where we can play videos to show people new procedures, and that just wasn't available years ago. So, I think we're well-positioned to try new stuff that will be very efficient and delicious, too. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the Will Slabaugh with Stephens. Please go ahead. Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Wonder if you could give us a little more color on the update on where we are from a digital standpoint. You mentioned mobile order and pay and a new app launching soon. Can you talk about the stats around that, the growth that you're seeing there? And then also where we stand with loyalty, if there's any stats you're willing to give around that? Curtis Evander Garner - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, thanks for the question. Well, I said in the prepared remarks that we have seen the highest increase in our digital properties on our web ordering platform, which is the platform that has seen the most innovation. Earlier in the year, we moved to a responsive online ordering site that gave our customers a fresh, new experience with Chipotle when they ordered digitally. That responsive ordering site automatically optimizes itself based upon the device you're using, so, if you're using a phone, it portrays itself like an app. If you're using a tablet, it portrays itself like a tablet system, and likewise for a laptop or desktop. We're encouraged with that growth because we're now to the point where we're going to make a similar release of innovation in a dedicated ordering app. And as I said, we haven't made a change to that platform for several years and the folks that use that app tend to be our most regular customers because they've taken the step to download it and install it on their device. Even without making those changes to date, and we expect the new app in the first part of the fourth quarter, we've seen a 38% increase in mobile ordering because of the efficiencies that we've been able to drive with meal customizations and also because of the emphasis that's been put into the restaurants operationally around staffing and running the dedicated second-make line that already exists in the majority of our restaurants. As it relates to our loyalty program, the new app will also offer digital offers for the first time, and we see that as the first step towards what a loyalty program would look like for Chipotle. Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.: Got you. And if I could just do a quick follow-up on a comment you made earlier. Jack, you mentioned the core to-date comp, and I apologize for going back to this, so I wanted to make sure I was clear. So, you mentioned if you held the two-year through the quarter you'd be at, I think you said a 5.6%. Was that the trend the first couple of weeks on a one-year basis of 5.5%-ish or so? Or was it a little below that, depending on your comps? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: No, no, no. What I was trying to say is that the trend in the first two weeks was still at that two-year trend of like down 17.5%. If we were to hold a 17.5% two-year trend throughout the whole quarter, our comp for Q3 this year would be 5.6%. Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.: Got you. So, we're somewhat below that the first couple of weeks. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, the comparison, like I said, especially in that second week were tougher, but we've seen consistently throughout the last two, three months that we've held that kind of two-year trend, and so when we've gone against tougher comparisons, easier comparisons, you'll see the current year comp bounce up and down, but the two-year has been pretty darn consistent throughout. Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.: Got you. Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Will. Operator : The next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Just revisiting the two major drivers that I thought about from last quarter, which were the marketing and digital, and Mark, you were talking about the marketing and perhaps adjusting the creative. How much do you think is the creative versus not really having the news yet? Menu news or value news is traditionally what we see in restaurants. You're talking about queso, do you think the advertising and queso kind of need each other? And is that \u2013 how much of that do you think is the issue? Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, I mean I've said consistently for years that one of the reasons we haven't done television in the past was, well, one, early days we didn't have really enough restaurants to make it as efficient as it needed to be, but we passed that several years ago. More of the reasons I said we didn't do television was because we don't have the types of offerings that really lend themselves to these formats, and particularly now, the most pervasive TV format is a 15-second spot. So, the way you said it I think is exactly right. I mean, I think the advertising kind of needs queso. I mean we're in a really unique position right now in that we're restoring a brand that's lost a bunch of customers, and at the same time, trying to bring in new customers, and so, when you look at something like queso, it's a really interesting product because let's just compare it to, say, a dessert, for example. Queso is something that could attract new customers, could attract lapsed customers, could increase frequency of existing customers, and then also have the ability to increase check average. It hits on all four, whereas, if you look at a dessert, it's unlikely that you're going to get somebody who's a competitor's customer to come to Chipotle because of that, whereas we know that it's one of the main reasons why people reject Chipotle that we don't have queso. So, that \u2013 it's one of the reasons why I'm excited about the potential to actually add it into the television campaign this fall. So, I do think that the entry into television accomplished what I predicted it would when we did it last year and then in the spring, which was it delivered outsized reach that's very efficient, so it's a great way to reach a lot of people. But absent a compelling reason why people should get up and come in, it's going to be reduced in terms of its potential, and so we have that now. So, yeah, I mean, I do expect that given it's in television that this sort of thing is going to be pretty effective. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And just one other follow-up, the digital front, it seems like similarly digital seems to need delivery to really be leveraged. You get an incremental user from remote order, if it's a high-volume store and they're trying to really avoid all that negative time of waiting in the line, but do you feel like delivery is the big unlock on that? And where are you on that? Curtis Evander Garner - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thank you, David. I agree that delivery is important and we integrated delivery into our second make line earlier in the year and have seen a substantial increase in the number of guests that are taking advantage of that functionality, talking specifically around web and app ordering. Our vision for the future is to integrate that experience more directly into the online and mobile sites, because now customers that are taking advantage of that service tend to go to the service provider site first and order from there, and we'd like to give them the option as they're checking out through Chipotle. So, that is certainly one of the areas that we're investigating and investing in as part of our digital roadmap. We've also launched delivery for catering in about 1,000 restaurants in the quarter. But we've not advertised that yet, as we're getting our teams spooled up for what that order volume looks like, but have a plan to make that part of our digital advertising campaign in the fall as we get back to what is typically a heavy season for us in terms of catering. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : The last question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. First, just on the food incident that happened a couple \u2013 a week ago, I guess. How \u2013 were comps declining or were they softening across the country? Was it just a geographic concentration and by the time you got to California consumers didn't really notice? How widespread or concentrated was the decline in comps relative to prior trend? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, John, as you can imagine, it's much more intense in that area. If you take the entire market, the dozens or the \u2013 30, 40, 50 stores around there, they were hit the most, but this did receive national news. And so, if you look at every single market, every market was impacted, but it was obviously much heavier in the mid-Atlantic region and the rest of the country, so pretty much every market did see some impact. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then on store openings, how do you think about \u2013 what changes you view on how fast you want to grow in this environment given the competitive environment, still some operational challenges you need to overcome, some customer reacquisition? Is it \u2013 what metrics are you looking at to say, listen, maybe growing slow and focusing on the base is a better idea? And maybe, Jack, can you just talk about how the class of 2016 has performed a year out from when they initially opened to maybe how your class of 2017 is performing year-to-date? Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: John, I'll go ahead and answer that. In early 2016, we reevaluated our approach to the restaurant portfolio. We focused, at that time, on proven markets, we reduced our development costs, they're now down at $760,000, and we began to support all openings with marketing. As a result, the new restaurant sales are actually improving at a faster rate than the rest of our restaurants. So, right now we recovered about a third of our sales volume from the pre-2015 incidents, whereas, for the restaurants in the company as a whole, we've recovered a little more than a sixth. So, right now when you look at these group of rookie restaurants, they are delivering us an ROI of 31%, which continues to be compelling to us, and that is up from 15% in 2016. Of course, it's off of the 55% ROI we saw prior to the incident in 2015, but it's still very compelling. So, the triggers that would cause us to change our approach to development are essentially our ability to operate the restaurants at the level that we want to, and so we're constantly talking to our operations team and we've made some adjustments to the way we're opening the restaurants. We've pulled back in some markets, in the Northeast we've slowed, we've pushed openings. We've reduced the number of openings in new markets and in remote markets, which are particularly challenging for the ops team to support. But we're constantly having a dialogue, and we just had one again yesterday with Scott about his feeling about our ability to continue to support these openings, and at the moment, Scott asks us to pull back on these things for those reasons, we'll do it. Having said that, you can appreciate that this portfolio or this pipeline is two years in the making, and so, changes to it takes some time. But that's the reason why we would pull back on these things, and yet we \u2013 and we'll be constantly re-evaluating that. Of course, the events of late could have some impact. It's way too early right now to tell what the ongoing impact of this is going to be. Yes, Steve, do you want to add? Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, John, the only thing I'd add is similar to prior years, the newest stores, so those opened in the last 12 months to 18 months, are the highest comping stores. So, they opened up at a respectable volume, they opened up at a respectful return, even at these lower volumes, and then they're the fastest growing. The only thing I would add is, while we're focusing on training, our most structured training right now happens in new stores. It's a new-store, dedicated team. It's not fragmented as you go from region to region to region, and so the training is more thorough than hiring new people in an existing store, new crew in an existing store. And it's more consistent. And so, we have some of our best welcoming of new people into our new restaurants just because we have this better training approach. Frankly, what we'd like to do is, Scott is looking into this, is take that same regimented, very thorough approach and make sure that we have a more thorough approach across the entire company. So, from a people standpoint and from an opening standpoint and then from a comp growth standpoint, it all suggests to us that we should keep going at this measured pace. It's lower than we were a few years ago, but we think we should be thoughtful about going at a measured pace. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, John. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to Mark Alexee for closing remarks. Mark Alexee - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Great. Thanks, everyone for your time today. We really appreciate it. We look forward to sharing our third quarter results with you, which is planned again for October 24. Great, and have a great day. Operator : This concludes tonight's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

On the call with us today are Steve Ells, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Boatwright, Chief Restaurant Officer; Mark Crumpacker, Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer; Curt Garner, Chief Digital and Information Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve. Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Last December, I returned to the role of sole CEO, committed to restoring the operational excellence that made us successful. It's been a challenging year and the third quarter was no exception, but we are making meaningful progress. We're entering the fourth quarter with a positive sales trend that I believe demonstrates our strategy is paying off. During our prepared remarks today, we're going to share with you the progress we've made toward our goals and provide more details about our plans for the future. Upon my return as sole CEO, I implemented a plan that realigned our organization toward the following five essential goals. Number one, deliver an excellent guest experience; number two, restore brand trust and drive sales; number three, foster innovation around the menu and the guest experience; number four, restore our economic model; and number five, strengthen our culture and recommit to our purpose. In order to execute against these goals, we made changes to our board of directors, our officer team and our field operation structure. I'm pleased to report that the addition of four new board directors in December 2016 has been extremely productive, and they have provided excellent guidance as we execute against our strategy. Over the course of the year, we also made several very important additions to our officer team, including one that I'll announce today. Over the last several months, we added Scott Boatwright as our Chief Restaurant Officer and Laurie Schalow as our Chief Communications Officer. Both Scott and Laurie have hit the ground running, and we'll hear from Scott directly about his progress toward improving our restaurant operations. And today, I'm excited to announce that we have retained Mike Malanga to advise the Chipotle officer team and lead our development function. Mike has been consulting with us on key development initiatives over the past several months. He's been so insightful and added so much to the team that we asked him to expand our consulting engagement to lead the development team beginning immediately. Mike will align our development organization with our long-term strategic goals and identify a permanent leader for development. He has more than 30 years of experience in development, most recently serving as Senior Vice President, Store Development, Americas at Starbucks. During his 12-year tenure there, Mike was responsible for all aspects of development, including real estate design, construction, facilities management, and lease administration. Mike's addition will allow for Mark Crumpacker to focus on addressing our long-term customer strategy in his new role as Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer. Mark will oversee our marketing efforts and our strategic planning process. This will include oversight of our NEXT Team which is responsible for innovation of both menu and customer experience. Mark has been central to the development of the strategy against which we are currently executing, and he will share some details of our longer-term strategy later on the call. These leadership changes are essential to achieve the strategic goals I outlined earlier, and we will continue to assess the need for additional leadership roles. With our strengthened board and officer team, we are successfully executing against our strategy. I'd like to provide some examples of the progress we've made against these goals we set a year ago. I'll give you a high-level summary, and then Scott, Mark, Curt, and Jack will go into specifics during their prepared comments. We have improved operations throughout our organization by focusing our teams on the customer, redoubling our training efforts, and aligning manager and field leader compensation around customer-driven measures. Under Scott's leadership, we've streamlined our field leadership structure and clarified the roles of our field leaders and restaurant teams. Scott has our teams focused on the basics of running great restaurants, and he is delivering on a plan for operational excellence. We still have more work to do, but we're already seeing results in our restaurants. We've also made important strides in restoring consumer trust and driving sales. Our third quarter saw the rollout of our largest ever television advertising campaign, which we used to promote queso. Not only did this campaign successfully change the narrative about Chipotle, early indications are that it's driving sales at the start of the fourth quarter. The marketing team continues to be focused on communicating our commitment to serving only the best, high-quality ingredients in the food we serve. We also drove sales through our ongoing efforts to strengthen digital ordering, which continues to perform near record levels for us. Since implementing Smarter Pickup Times earlier this year, we've seen a 51% increase in digital orders. Because our digital orders are made on a second make line, it allows us to deliver excellent throughput and enhance the experience for our customers who are increasingly moving to digital ordering. We've also made significant progress toward fostering innovation. During the year, we created the NEXT Team which is focused on innovations in the kitchen and restaurant design, the menu, and the guest experience. One notable effort of the NEXT Team is the addition of the NEXT Kitchen in Manhattan. The NEXT Kitchen allows us to test operational impact of potential new menu items prior to broader market testing, while at the same time providing some early indications of customer acceptance. But the NEXT Team will also explore new strategic opportunities across the business, including how we incorporate digital technology into the guest experience. This could include developing a new digitally-forward restaurant design, a new remodel program, or exploring new customer segments and day parts. We have also made significant progress in restoring our economic model. Clearly, the third quarter was very unusual due to non-recurring events that impacted our performance, including hurricanes that prompted the closure of hundreds of restaurants across three states, and the costs associated with the data security issue we saw earlier in the year. In spite of these challenges, we closed the quarter on a positive note, with sales trends that we hope will continue during the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we have generated revenue of $3.37 billion, an increase of 17% compared to the first three quarters of last year, with comparable restaurant sales growth of 8.3%. Finally, I'd like to address the last strategic goal we've had for the year, which is strengthening our culture at Chipotle. It's always been my goal to prove that food could be served fast without being a typical fast food experience. Over time, as I learned more about how the ingredients we use are raised, we became a champion for ingredients raised with respect for the farmers, the animals, and the environment. Chipotle continues to lead in choosing ingredients without antibiotics or added hormones, buying local and organic produce when possible, rejecting genetically-engineered ingredients and eliminating industrial additives, including preservatives from our food. Many of our employees work at Chipotle because we are a purpose-driven company, committed to choosing the harder right over the easier wrong, but we have a powerful opportunity to more strongly connect our employees and our customers to our purpose. I'm pleased to report that we are making significant progress towards strengthening this connection. We have reengaged our company with our values, connected them to our long-term strategic goals and begun working with all of our leaders to become champions for our purpose and for their teams. In doing so, we are continuing to reignite the passion our loyal customers have found in our brand. Last quarter certainly presented its share of challenges and distractions, but we are responding to these challenges and are strengthening our company. We have built better, stronger teams, refined our strategy with a renewed focus on our guests, and committed to innovation inside our restaurants. I'm confident in our team's ability to return Chipotle on the path of success and sustainable growth for shareholders, all while remaining true to our purpose of cultivating nourished communities where wholesome food is enjoyed every day. I will now turn the call over to Scott Boatwright. Scott Boatwright - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. A little over five months ago I joined Chipotle and I can't begin to explain how excited I am to be here. I spent my first few months physically working inside our restaurants and I traveled to meet our crew, our managers, and our field leaders. In my time in the field, I was able to observe the many things that make Chipotle truly special, the amount of real cooking we do every single day, and seeing the passion from our employees in this brand. There is an immense amount of pride across Chipotle to bring real, wholesome food to our guests. I saw this passion again in late August when we held our biennial field leadership conference. I had the pleasure of meeting all of our field leaders from across the country. We discussed how the guest experience begins with leadership, specifically the role of the general managers and field leaders, as well as training inside of our restaurants. And we are removing the distractions and tasks that limit us from focusing on the guest. By narrowing the role of leadership and returning to a culture of training, we will deliver a consistently great guest experience across the country. Through this time in the field, I have identified several opportunities for improvement. I have found the general manager and field leader roles to be unclear. And without defined roles and responsibilities, people are often distracted as they are not focused on the things that ladder to a great guest experience. As the leaders of the brand, it is incumbent upon us to simplify what we are asking of our field teams. And while we have great training tools, we are not consistently using them. Our teams want to deliver an excellent guest experience and we must be singularly focused on building a culture to support that goal. The care in which we take in sourcing and prepping our ingredients must now be applied to the care and consideration for how our guests feel when they dine in our restaurants. Fixing these opportunities will not require a revolutionary change. The solution is rooted in the way that Steve built our operations years ago. By focusing on the guest first, keeping things simple, and acting with an owner's mentality, we have outlined a plan to achieve these goals and are rolling out a number of changes. Earlier this month, we reorganized our field leadership teams and operating structure to align our resources with our commitment toward leadership development and training. To add leadership support closer to our restaurants, we reduced the number of layers at the top of the field hierarchy and added more field leaders directly above our restaurants. This is more effective when managing large-scale operations, consistent with industry best practices. Our field leaders will be far more impactful when they are not stretched too thin with too many restaurants. And we have clearly articulated the roles, purpose, and responsibilities of field leaders to help them be more effective with smaller spans of control. In addition, we've restructured our operation support. We will now have an operation services department responsible for training, facilities, ops integration, and new restaurant openings. This effort will be led by a single executive director reporting to me. This allows us to create a better support model for our restaurant teams and will help minimize the volume of activity coming from our support centers that can ultimately create distractions. It will also ensure that we only work on those processes, tasks, and innovations that will make the GM's job easier and/or allow us to deliver a more consistently great guest experience. Lastly, we are improving our hiring process so that we can find really great talent, we hire quickly, and get crew members trained thoroughly and properly. Comprehensive trainings instills confidence within our managers and our crew members to successfully complete the prep, serve our guest, or address any potential issues inside the restaurant. That confidence helps create a productive culture that attracts hardworking team members. More importantly, it also helps us retain those great employees who want to be a part of this very unique brand and begin to develop them into terrific future leaders for Chipotle. During all of these important changes, we have asked our development team to temper our new restaurant openings for the next 12 to 18 months before reaccelerating our growth. This is designed to give our field teams a greater opportunity to absorb the new operating strategy and structure, restore emphasis on a strong training culture within our existing restaurants, and deliver the high standards our guests deserve 100% of the time. Mark Crumpacker will talk more about this shortly. Conversations I've had with our restaurant and support teams have reinforced my view that we will accomplish a lot in a short period of time. I know that our teams are motivated and energized. And after a challenging couple of years, our teams are hungry to win. I thank all of our field teams and the rest of the organization for welcoming me, welcoming my ideas and plans for our operations. Steve has charged me with shifting the mindset in our restaurants to be more focused on our guests and operational excellence. This is an area in which I have a lot of experience. I look forward to providing updates on the hard work that we're putting into our operations and the progress we make to ensure our restaurants are the very best that they can be. I'll now turn the call over Mark. Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Scott. Operational excellence inside our restaurants is fundamental to long-term sustainable growth. As we work to achieve a consistently great experience, we are also executing against our customer experience strategy. Building customer trust and loyalty and ultimately the sales volumes we once enjoyed will result from the thoughtful evolution of our customer experience combined with consistent operations. This evolution is ongoing and includes menu innovation, an enhanced digital experience, re-envisioned store environments, more convenient ways to enjoy our food, and better hospitality and customer service, all combined with marketing that drives an emotional connection to our brand and to our commitment to making delicious wholesome food accessible to everyone. In addition to the work we are doing to strengthen our operations, our strategy and innovation teams are hard at work evolving the customer experience across all aspects of our brand. In this new chapter defined by innovation and an evolution of the customer experience, there will be much experimentation, testing, and refinement along the way. Our teams are working on a variety of initiatives, including several new menu items, which include frozen margaritas, desserts, new salad greens and dressings, and a range of other menu items which are currently in the R&D process. Our team is also designing a new beverage program for Chipotle, which includes a top to bottom redesign of the beverages we serve and how they are merchandised to our customers. Simultaneously, our design teams are working on evolving our restaurant environments. This includes design changes that can be applied to existing restaurants as well as designs for new sites. These enhancements are driven by our customer experience strategy which emphasizes digital, convenience, and hospitality. During the quarter, our menu and marketing teams launched queso nationally. The launch followed a large-scale consumer test in more than 350 restaurants, during which we experienced encouraging sales and research results. Unlike nearly every other fast food company, Chipotle rarely adds new menu items, so the addition of anything new generates significant interest, positive and negative. Nevertheless, our sales data and research results show that many of our customers enjoy our queso made with no preservatives or artificial ingredients, and it was an easy decision to roll it out nationally. With the national queso launch, we saw an immediate sales lift in the high single-digits as a percentage, which leveled off after initial trial. And when advertising support began at the end of September, we saw another increase before leveling off again. Currently, about 15% of our customers continue to order queso. This new menu item not only increased sales with existing customers, it also attracted new and lapsed customers into our restaurants. About 19% of these new and returning customers are trying queso, while many of the others were simply driven in by the advertising. We know that each of these visits is essentially a test run of Chipotle, and is an opportunity for us to remind our guests of the delicious food, quality of our ingredients, and convenience of dining at Chipotle. Awareness and sentiment surrounding queso are also encouraging with more of 80% of our customers indicating that they are aware of our queso and more than half of respondents indicating that they thought our queso was better than that offered by our competitors. 93% of customers that tried queso on an entr\u00e9e said they like our queso, and more than half indicated that they would be likely to visit Chipotle more often because of the queso. The queso advertising campaign, which consists of television, digital, and social, continues through mid-November and has included television ads that aired during 12 broadcast premiers, including This Is Us, the second highest rated premiere of the season, and Sunday and Monday night football games. Social media support centered around an Instagram campaign called the Queso Cup, which was very successful in engaging customers with a completion rate of 70% among customers who opted into the week-long challenge to win free queso. Support for digital and out-of-store ordering continues into the fourth quarter, since enhancing our digital ordering capabilities with the roll out of our Smarter Pickup Times initiative. Online advertising support for digital ordering is continuing to be very effective, driving more than 40% of all online orders. During the third quarter, our return on investment for online order advertising is about sevenfold. We will continue advertising support for online ordering into the fourth quarter, as well as advertising support for catering, which sees a historical seasonal lift through the holiday season. As a follow-up to Scott's comments about new restaurant openings, we expect to open between 130 and 150 restaurants next year, a reduction from this year's openings. While we still firmly believe that we have the potential to open up 5,000 restaurants in the U.S., we have decided that it is a higher priority right now to focus on operational excellence, including improving our training, culture, and elevating our guest experience in our existing restaurants. Ultimately, we believe this temporary reduction in openings will make us stronger in operations and we expect the quality and returns of our real estate portfolio will strengthen during this time. There is still much work to be done rebuilding trust and loyalty, but we are well on our way. There's no quick fix, but we are evolving our customer experience to be the most compelling of any restaurant brand. That, coupled with ongoing marketing that reinforces the quality of our ingredients, the deliciousness of our food, and our commitment to doing the right thing will ensure our future success. I'll now turn the call over Curt. Curt Garner - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. We continue to be pleased with the progress we are making with our key digital commerce initiatives. Second make line sales as a percentage of overall sales were 8%, the highest level we've seen for a third quarter and are up 32% over the prior year. Importantly, we continue to see strong results in our busiest restaurants, with the top 10% of restaurants seeing second make line sales exceeding 15% of total sales mix. We expect this momentum to grow as we continue the rollout of our new technology-enabled second make line. We have now deployed this system to 62 restaurants and are accelerating our installations and will have over 200 restaurants live by the end of this year. We have prioritized the installations so our busiest second make line restaurants receive this new technology first. We also have a robust innovation pipeline, with several new capabilities set to launch in the near-term. I'm excited to announce that the new Chipotle app, available on both iOS and Android, is scheduled to launch on November 6. In addition to significant improvements that we have made in user experience and ease of ordering, we are launching new capabilities that will enhance the guest experience, our marketing capabilities, and speed of service. As an example, the new Chipotle app offers our guests the ability to rapidly reorder their favorite meals by displaying on the home screen their favorite entr\u00e9e, nearest restaurant, and fastest pickup time. We are also launching a digital offer platform that allows customers to receive, manage, and redeem Chipotle offers directly from their app wallet. An additional feature that will be available at launch is the integration of mobile payment methods, including Apple Pay, which is one of the most requested items from our customers. Supporting mobile payments will enable us to remove pay-in-store as a payment option, which will not only further speed up throughput in our digital channels, but will help customers pay in an easier way. Heading into the fourth quarter, we also launched a new ordering partnership with Facebook. Through this partnership, Facebook users can order Chipotle from local restaurants using popular delivery services such as Grubhub and delivery.com, among others. While it's way too soon to have a sense for how this ordering option will be received, it is very consistent with our belief in finding innovative partnerships to make it more convenient for guests to engage with Chipotle through channels that they choose. In addition to the Facebook partnership, during the quarter, we completed the integration of all of our delivery partners into Smarter Pickup Times, and we are looking to add as many as four delivery partners between now and the end of the year. While still fairly new, we are encouraged by the potential of these third-party delivery partnerships, as delivery orders were up 33% in the third quarter. We are also confident that catering has the potential to be a sustained growth driver for Chipotle. Over the last year, we launched several improvements to catering, including online ordering, payment, and delivery. Customer response is strong, with catering sales increasing 14% in the quarter. And there is much more we can do with this channel. In the fourth quarter, we will start by piloting new catering offerings. Currently, the minimum catering order size is a group of 20, and we will introduce a new group size to accommodate a party of 10. Currently, we offer only one price tier, which is approximately $13 per person. But we're piloting three new price tiers, with prices starting at under $9 per person. We believe that these changes will significantly broaden the appeal of our catering offering and increase the frequency and accessibility of Chipotle catering. I'm encouraged with the response we've seen with the improvements we've made to the digital experience and the new capabilities I've mentioned today, plus the rich innovation pipeline we have in front of us position us well to continue to see growth across all our channels. I'll now turn the call over to Jack. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Curt. When you consider all the changes we focused on this year, all of it has been examined through the asking the question, how can we improve the guest experience? When a guest visits Chipotle today, we want to make sure we're doing everything we can to provide a delicious meal and provide great service by a talented, well-trained team. We have made some very important strides this year, strengthening our senior leadership, simplifying our restaurant operations, placing a greater focus on the guest, and fostering a culture of innovation. And while there's still much more to be done, we believe the changes we're making and our renewed focus have us on the right path. In the third quarter, we reported revenue of $1.13 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.69. The third quarter was impacted by several unexpected items as we had unusual impacts related to hurricanes from this summer, historically high avocado costs, store closures and a data security incident. We believe the combination of these factors negatively impacted EPS by about $1.05 per share. I'd like to address these unusual impacts first, then provide a sales review, and finally, I'll walk through the highlights of the P&L. First, our core business was adversely impacted by hurricanes Harvey and Irma that hit Texas, Louisiana, and Florida. About 425 of our restaurants were directly in the path of the storms, and even more restaurants were indirectly impacted by the subsequent rain all along the East Coast. The safety of our employees and guests is always a top priority when we encounter dangerous situations like these, and we could not be more proud of our field leaders, our restaurant managers, our crew members and our facility staff for taking care of each other during the storms and for getting the restaurants up and running so quickly despite managing their own personal hardships at home. Due to the downtime from the hurricanes, we estimate that our sales were lower by nearly $6 million or 50 basis points of comp for the entire quarter. We also have four restaurants that remain temporarily closed and two expected new openings that have been substantially delayed. The lower sales impacted our earnings by about $0.06 in the quarter. There were $3.3 million of incremental expenses directly related to the hurricanes, from paying all of our hourly employees even while restaurants were closed, from charitable contributions to support recovery efforts and related to write-offs and repairs associated with the damage to our restaurants. Expenses directly tied to the hurricanes accounted for an additional $0.07 of EPS impact. We also had historically high avocado prices, especially in the wake of Tropical Storm Lidia, which in early September began to inundate the western coast of Mexico and continued to move east across the growing regions of the country. The rains and cooler temperatures in Mexico slowed the maturing process, delaying the harvest of the fruit which caused a gap in available supply. This coincided with the end of the growing seasons in California and Peru, resulting in a severe price spike. In a matter of weeks, our case costs nearly doubled, before beginning to ease in October. The harvest in Mexico is now shaping up nicely and expectations are for pricing to normalize. The impact for the full quarter was 40 basis points higher than Q2, even though we had actually expected relief in avocado prices from already high levels in the second quarter. This impacted EPS in the quarter by about $0.19. As a historical perspective, the avocado prices in the quarter are about 150 basis points higher than normal levels seen two years ago. In addition to the impact of the hurricanes, we also made the decision to close two restaurants and relocate a third restaurant during the quarter, along with the expected closure of three additional restaurants in October. Impairments for these restaurants and other miscellaneous write-offs for equipment totaled about $4.4 million in the quarter, which impacted EPS by about $0.09. Lastly related to unusual items, we recorded a $30 million liability for the anticipated assessment by payment card networks related to the data security incident announced in April of this year, and that reduced EPS by about $0.64. This expense is an early estimate and a final determination, which we expect sometime in 2018, could differ from this estimate. Although our IT security team identified and isolated this incident in a matter of weeks during March and April of this year, this level of potential exposure is a result of our high daily transaction volumes. This $30 million expense is included in G&A for the quarter, and we'll continue to assess any possible shift in that potential liability going forward. For the full quarter, our comps increased 1%, and adjusting for the Chiptopia revenue deferral from last year, the underlying comp would have been flat. This 100 basis point benefit will reverse over the next six months and there will be a drag of about 50 basis points to 60 basis points on the comp in both Q4 2017 and Q1 of 2018. While comps ended up flat overall for the quarter, adjusting for the revenue deferral, the actual daily and weekly comps varied widely. And I think best way to provide insight into sales during the quarter is to separate the quarter into three distinct underlying sales trends. Initially, comps in the first half of the July were up 4.5%. Then, from mid-July through September 11, just before the unadvertised launch of queso, our comps were down about 2.25%. And lastly, from September 12th through the end of September when queso was launched and then advertised, comps were a positive 4%. I've excluded the hurricane impact from these segments as those impacts were relatively short-lived and each market impacted bounced back nicely. So, the hurricane effect was truly temporarily. In October, comps so far are running in the 2% to 3% range, before the negative impact of the Chiptopia deferred revenue. So, the launch of queso has added about 6% to the comp in September and is adding an incremental 4% to 5% in October so far when compared to the negative 2.25% trend pre-queso. The additional comp boost upon national launch, as well as just after the advertising launch came from a combination of increased check, as a lot of our existing customers added queso to their entr\u00e9e, and also from increased transactions as the advertising drove a lot of new and lapsed customers into our restaurants. And now in October, most of the added comp is coming from increased average check with about 15% of our customers adding queso to their entr\u00e9e or adding it on the side. In the fourth quarter, we plan to expand our price increase that we trialed earlier in the year. As we've mentioned previously, we've seen little or no resistance to the increase taken last spring in about 500 restaurants, and we're now going on four years without a price increase in most of our restaurants. In mid or late November, we will increase prices by an average of about 5% in just shy of 900 restaurants, primarily in restaurants located in the Midwest and Texas, with some pockets in the Southwest and Southeast. We'll continue to evaluate any potential resistance in these markets and if all goes well, we'll decide on a potential increase in the nearly 1,000 remaining restaurants in early 2018. This pricing will help offset continued high inflationary costs, especially around increased labor wages and higher occupancy rates. While we typically provide comp guidance for the upcoming year during our third quarter release, we're going to hold off at least until our fourth quarter release. That will allow us the opportunity to see the sustained impact of queso, the completion of our ad campaign, the response to our new app, and monitor the customer acceptance of the price increase I just mentioned. We'll also continue to refine our marketing plan for next year and finalize our 2018 field plan over the next few months, all of which we will incorporate into our expectations for the 2018 comp. For the quarter, our food costs were 35%, an increase of 90 basis points from Q2, largely driven by higher avocado costs. Heading into the fourth quarter, we believe that our food costs will normalize to just over 34%, and early indications for 2018 are that we may be able to improve even further due to an expected abundant avocado crop, along with a benefit of the menu price increase. We continue to make improvements in labor management in the restaurants, but higher wages offset much of that benefit. In Q4, we'll increase wages during our semiannual merit increase for crew, but we anticipate labor expense as a percent of sales will remain similar to the third quarter. Heading into 2018, labor will continue to be a challenge in the tight labor market and with rising wages, but we'll continue to search for ways to effectively schedule and manage our restaurant labor to deliver an excellent guest experience, while driving labor leverage. Within other operating costs, our marketing and promo expenses were lower versus last year as we lapped the significant investment for Chiptopia from last year. Marketing and promo expenses were 3.3% during the third quarter. Our combined marketing and promo costs will increase in the fourth quarter to about 4% of sales as the majority of our national ad campaign is occurring in the fourth quarter. Our G&A expenses during the quarter were $99 million, which included the $30 million estimated charge related to the data security incident. Excluding this charge, we anticipate that our fourth quarter G&A expenses should be relatively flat in dollar terms to the third quarter. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense was $17 million during the third quarter. During the quarter, we accelerated our stock buybacks to $102.5 million at an average price of $341 per share and we ended the quarter with over $548 million of cash and investments. We also announced today that our board has authorized an additional $100 million in share repurchases. From a capital allocation perspective, while we'll continue to buy our stock opportunistically, we also believe that the best use of cash is to continue to invest in the Chipotle business. This includes continuing to build additional Chipotle restaurants, but also includes thoughtful investment in innovation such as digital, new menu options and refreshing or reimaging our restaurants where it makes sense. Despite what was a noisy and challenging quarter, we've implemented substantial changes to our operational leadership, launched a significant menu item, rallied our restaurant teams to focus on training. All of these changes to date and our strategic goals are designed to deliver an excellent guest experience. As we look to the end of the year and begin to plan for 2018, we're confident that we're moving in the right direction, and are making the necessary moves to ensure the long-term success for our brand, our employees, and our shareholders. Thank you. And now, we'll open up the lines for questions. Operator : At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: I guess first on queso, if you could give any perspective on kind of the tail you're seeing in California and Colorado since those were the earliest markets. And then secondarily, as you slow development next year, Jack, I mean, what's the plan for the extra cash that you'll generate? It should be, I don't know, an extra $100 million of free cash flow, should we build that into share repurchases, any thoughts there. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah. Sharon, first on the queso, Colorado and California both held up after the first few weeks we saw a spike, especially in Colorado, that leveled off. But it leveled off after just a few weeks and then it held. And so what they saw after, I'd say, three or four weeks, Colorado continued to hold as an incremental comp, even to this day. Pacific, Southern California, they had a lower overall impact, but again, things settled after like three or four weeks. So, we're hoping that we saw in October the 2% to 3% comp or so that I mentioned in my prepared remarks that that will continue through the rest of the quarter. In terms of cash for next year, Sharon, yeah, the additional cash will either go into strategic investments such as digital, things like remodels. We won't be able to do much in a way of remodels early in the year because we want to actually have a few reimaged, reimagined restaurants. In the first quarter, we'll examine those, and we may decide to remodel more stores in the second half of the year. But to the extent that we don't have strategic investments in our business, I think you can expect that we'll continue to buy back stock at this higher level that you just saw. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: And just to clarify, Jack, Colorado and California, I mean, on average, are those at a mid-teens attachment rate? Is it single-digit? I mean, any clarity there? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Well, if you average them together, Sharon, they average about what we're seeing at a company-wide level. Colorado was higher. Pacific was lower. But when you add them together, they're pretty close to what we're seeing with the national rollout. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from David Palmer, RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good evening. You mentioned a few things on the call today that are drivers for sales. There's even a mention of a food innovation pipeline and obviously you've talked again about digital and delivery and improved operations focus. If you were to rank order the things or the reasons why sales would climb faster than the industry, and this recovery could be reignited so to speak after some of these food safety issues, how would you rank order those and what are you most excited about? Thanks. Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Well, I'll start by saying that we've had a lot of change in the last year, a lot of restructuring, so starting with adding four new board members, adding two new officers, including Scott Boatwright and Laurie Schalow. We've restructured our field leadership, and this is all toward the eye, in the eye of making sure that we deliver an extraordinary guest experience because we got away from that, as I stated about a year ago. We made a lot of progress. And I think fundamentally, when we deliver an extraordinary guest experience, it's really compelling and it's going to bring a lot of people back. Scott and I were just in restaurants all last week and when we were in excellent restaurants and we were in a few that were better than I've seen maybe ever and the way our crews connect with folks and the way people connect with our food and the experience is extraordinary. And I know by dedicating ourselves to bringing back operational excellence, we're going to get a lot of customers back. But that's not the only thing we need to do. We need to be an innovative company. For the past 24 years, we haven't really been an innovative company. We've leveraged the excitement around a very focused menu and about sourcing great ingredients, so we need to continue to do that and bring that back, and then also set ourselves up to be innovative and that's where I'll let Mark Crumpacker comment. Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah. If I were to rank the opportunities, I would say, as Steve said, I would put improving the guest experience at the top. I mean, there's a tremendous amount of room for us there and we've seen that that when we focus on that, we dramatically change the trajectory of a restaurant. Next, I would put enhancements to the digital experience in catering next on the list. I think those are two opportunities that we've not fully exploited for sure in the world of catering, but also in digital. And as Curt mentioned, we have a new version of the app coming out, new payment methods. We have that coinciding with the rollout of the digitally-enabled second make line. There's a tremendous amount of opportunity for us to increase the percentage of digital orders, which has the associated benefit of reducing congestion on the main line when we do that well. And then the third thing that I'd rank would be changes to the menu. As Steve mentioned, Chipotle is a company that historically hasn't added a lot to the menu. When we do it, we get a lot of attention for it. And there's a lot of potential for us to reignite interest, and particularly with lapsed customers, by making relatively small changes to our menu. It's really untapped potential for us. And so, that's the way I would rank those things. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Sara Senatore, AllianceBernstein (sic) [Sanford C. Bernstein] (42:20). Please proceed with your question. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. I have a follow-up on the top line and then just a question about margins. The first is, I guess I'm just trying to reconcile the comments and the enthusiasm about all of these initiatives with a comp that is 2% to 3% before the deferred revenue. And the implication, I think, is that basically you're back down to where you were before the impact of the credit card breach, kind of that down 17% from peak. So, I guess I'm just trying to understand how to sort of reconcile what seems to be a lot of enthusiasm, a big launch of queso, and also the marketing, all of which would seem to have been very successful, and yet it seems like you're still having difficulty just budging from that volume run rate. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yes. Sara, this is Jack. So, listen, I'll start. We had to suffer through several weeks of negative sales during the quarter, as I mentioned, when I described those three segments. And so, I don't know that we'd call ourselves enthusiastic about overall sales trends, but we did change the trend line. We were sitting on a negative 2%, I guess that average of negative 2.25% for several weeks during the quarter, and we've been able to change that trend line. Do we think we're done yet? Of course, not. Nobody's going to be jumping up in joy for a 2% to 3% positive comp, but it did take a negative 2% comp and turned it into a positive comp, and so it's a starting point. I think the enthusiasm is more about what we're focusing on, the strategies that we're working on right now. It's a lot of back to basics. It's a lot of focusing on our people so that they are well-trained, well-equipped, and confident about delivering an excellent guest experience. We've got some exciting digital developments, as Curt just mentioned, that are right around the corner. So, we've got a number of things that we think can enhance the guest experience. So, we're optimistic that those things will reignite the sales trends. So \u2013 but that is yet to happen. So, until that happens, we're going to continue to focus on these things that will make the experience better and hope that it will take the 2% to 3% comp up to a whole other level. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thank you. And just on the margins, if you could, are there any implications for slowing store growth with respect to the lower \u2013 sort of less of a drag on margins, but also maybe on the other hand, I think ramping up maturity curves has typically been a little bit of a contribution to comp. So, if you could just talk about those two things with respect to the slower unit growth. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, Sara, it's a very modest impact. As an example, our non-comp stores right now, those stores that have been open anywhere from one month to 11 months, they still generate a margin of about 10% for the year, so far, and so, yeah, they're lower than the 16% that we just generated, but \u2013 so, it will have less of a drag effect, but you're talking about a few dozen restaurants or so, maybe three or four dozen restaurants or so, so there is a little bit of relief and less of a drag, but it's not that significant. I'd say the same thing on the comp. Yes, our newest stores always are the highest comping layer, and then as you go to the two-year-old stores, they're the second highest comp. Three-year-old stores are the third highest comp. But again, you're talking about a matter of a few dozen stores, and so, it will have a bit of an impact and that would be a negative impact, but really, on a base of 2,200, 2,300, 2,400 stores, it's going to be a very, very modest impact. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Sara. Operator : Our next question is from John Ivankoe, JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thank you. The question was on future development. Presumably opening fewer stores is going to allow you to open better stores, so can you kind of comment what you think the new unit volumes are going to be going forward? And secondly, and, Jack, just to the previous question you just made a helpful comment, you're doing around a 10% margin on the newer stores, at least by our calculation. The newer stores look like they're tracking somewhere in the $1.5 million, $1.6 million range, which certainly isn't the returns that you used to have. But would you continue to open stores even at the new lowered pace if those unit economics in fact prove to be sticky? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, John, I don't know that we can comment on what we think the new sales will be. We're optimistic that as we move the number down that we'll go after the most risky or the most speculative site, and so we do think the volume will increase. You're right in the ballpark. Our average volumes are, for new stores that are opening up, at about $1.5 million. We do expect that number \u2013 if not higher. We do expect that number will go up as we open up fewer stores, but I don't know that I can give you a number. And in terms of returns, these are respectable returns. A 10% return at call it $1.5 million, $1.6 million volume, that's $150,000 cash flow at a less than $800,000 investment. It's only a 20% investment. It's not the 50%, 60%, 70% that we've historically delivered. But incrementally, that's going to add to shareholder value at that level, especially because those stores do comp at a higher level than other restaurants. And so, you're starting out at a 20-ish percent return and you're going to grow from there. So, these are returns worth investing in. But right now, we really have to allow our 70,000 employees out there to focus on the existing restaurants, the existing customers, focusing in on training. That's where the biggest opportunity is for us right now. So, this idea of pulling back on openings for the 12 to 18-month period, we think is absolutely the right thing to do. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And if I can, is it \u2013 pulling back on 12 to 18 months, is 2018 the bottom or is the run rate of store openings actually going to be the lowest as we kind of finish up 2018 and you put the brakes on development, which obviously takes time to slow it down? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Well, there's a tail there, John. So, I think you pull back for 12 to 18 months and then near the end of that 12 to 18-month period, I think we then start to say, okay, let's start ramping up. And so, I think 2018 is likely to be the bottom, although you may not see the reacceleration until late in 2019, just because there is a tail to get things ramped up again. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from David Tarantino, Baird. Please proceed with your question. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. Jack, just a couple of clarification questions. First, on the comps you're running so far in Q4, you mentioned up 2% to 3%, could you talk about maybe the breakdown of the check versus the traffic in that most recent trend? And then I have a follow-up. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, David, it's hard for me to give you any meaningful insight because we're comparing in October to the biggest month of the year. And so, if you look at just the pure math, the traffic is down a bit and the check is up a bit, but the problem is we were in a heavy promotional period, we had Love Story where customers can earn the opportunity to get free food or buy one get one, and so, that looked artificial to me. So, there's nothing I can give you meaningful in terms of what the real underlying traffic is, and what the real underlying check is. I think as we move away from comparing against this extremely high promotional period, we'll be able to see what kind of the normal underlying traffic trends and average check trends are. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And then, if I could have one more question on the margin outlook, any way to frame up how you're thinking about restaurant level margin as you move into next year? And I know in the past you've given us a framework that's sort of associated with different levels of same-store sales, but any way you can sort of give some initial thoughts on how 2018 might look at the \u2013 at whatever comp run rate you want to assume? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: David, I think this is similar to what we've talked about in the past, so this isn't necessarily meant to be a guidance, but at the nearly $2 million volume we're at right now, with normalization of food costs, especially avocados, and then allowing this price increase, and if we're able to push some or all of the remaining stores that haven't had an increase were able to increase prices, we believe we can deliver a margin in the 20% range at this $2 million volume. And the price increase, I don't want you to think that we're relying on the price increase to fund our margins, but it really has been four years for the vast majority of our stores that we've put any price increase through, and yet we've absorbed 4%, 5%, 6% of labor inflation during that time, and so, our margins have taken a huge hit during the past four years. And so, we think allowing us to pass on some of that increase, and it's only a portion of the increase, on through slightly higher menu prices, we think that we can normalize our margins. So, I still believe in the $2 million volume range, we can deliver margins in the 20%-ish range. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Okay, thanks, David. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Strelzik, BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Andrew, are you there? Andrew Strelzik - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi, can you hear me? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, Andrew. Andrew Strelzik - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. I'm wondering with some of the building out of the overhead structure and adding layers of \u2013 at the field level and things like that, how should we think about G&A going forward, the contributions of G&A going forward? Scott Boatwright - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: I'll do that. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Okay. Scott Boatwright - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Hi, Andrew. This is Scott here. A great question. We are actually removing layers in our field hierarchy today and removing some of the \u2013 what I believe to be just top-heavy field hierarchy in a work structure and instead of it being a G&A grab, we're going to repurpose those dollars to add additional field leaders closer to the restaurants, so we can reduce the standards of control. Andrew Strelzik - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Great. Scott Boatwright - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: And I was going to say, Andrew, I presume it to be, we haven't done the math yet, net neutral as it relates to G&A spend. Andrew Strelzik - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, great. And then I just had a question on taking down the development pace, can you help us understand the process you went through to identify that this is the right level of development going forward and kind of where you prioritize, or de-prioritize, I know you gave some of the regions, but just the thought process as you reached this level in terms of the guidance for 2018. Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, Andrew, I don't know that there was a precise science to it, but as Scott really got involved in working with our teams, it was very clear that, the analogy that I would use is we're changing the tire while the car's still moving and here we have a lot of people that we need to train or retrain how to run a great restaurant, how to deliver great throughput, how to execute our standards at a very, very, very high level. And yet, opening up new stores is a big distraction. You have to start thinking about hiring people months and months in advance. You've got to train people in advance of the opening. You sometimes are taking people from existing restaurants to staff a new restaurant. Turnover of a new restaurant often is high. You hire people and they didn't know what they signed up for, and so the turnover is very high. So, it's a distraction in a lot of ways. And so, from an ops standpoint, it just makes sense to pull back. Then you combine that, we're looking at our portfolio and saying, okay, there are certain areas where the team looks good. The team is able to handle this, the financials are great, the opening sales are great, and it's like you don't want to pull back on those. And so, it's a combination or an intersection of those two imperfect sciences, or imperfect arts if you will, where we come up to what we think is the right number. Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, and if I could just expand on that very quickly, I think it's important to note that it requires a great deal of talent planning to open up the volume of restaurants that we do today, and it has been a strain on our bench strength across the enterprise, and so this will allow us to restore some of the depleted positions throughout the organization, the field structure specifically, and get stronger in our current asset base, but also get us prepared for much additional or larger growth in the future. Andrew Strelzik - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Thank you very much for the color. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Bittner, Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed with your question. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. I have a question on comps and then a question on unit growth. On the comps, you guys are comping 2% to 3% positive in October, and your guidance is for slightly negative comps for the fourth quarter at least implied by the full year is. Is that just a function of facing tougher compares in November and December, or is that not the case, should we really start looking at your trends on a three-year basis once you get into November. Any color on that would be helpful. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: First of all, we're not predicting negative comps in the fourth quarter. We're predicting that if comps stay in that same kind of level, that the year-to-date comp will drop down to 6.5%. But it's not a negative comp. We had a negative comp... Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay, okay. Thanks. Thanks for the clarification. The full year guidance I just had plugged in implied something in the fourth quarter, so if it's not... John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: No, we're not expecting any kind of downturn whatsoever. So, yeah. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And just on the unit growth, you guys have opened around 500 restaurants since late 2015, and I think some of these or a lot of these are in existing markets. The question is just based on your ability to analyze these restaurants internally, is there any evidence that the addition of these stores over the last three years is one of the reasons why you're having a difficult time restoring the unit economics in comping in the recovery that you kind of were expecting? Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: No. No evidence whatsoever. We open different number of stores in different markets and we're not seeing that the number of restaurant openings has had an impact on our recovery whatsoever. And it's got \u2013 and that has nothing to do with our desire to pull back at this time. It really was let's focus on the existing 2,300 and so there's no correlation whatsoever that you're suggesting. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein, Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. Just one maybe on the broader menu evolution. I know you mentioned it earlier, Steve, but in the past, it was all about kind of over the existing menu and fine tuning for greater efficiency rather than broadening, and now it does seem like with the competitive pressures and the goal to bring back lost traffic, you guys seem quite keen to expand the menu, whether it's proteins, queso, beverages and desserts, and whatnot. So, I'm just wondering how you visualize the menu maybe three years out, whether we should assume it broadens meaningfully further from here. I think you mentioned maybe day parts, segments, I'm assuming people are thinking about breakfast and otherwise, I'm just wondering what's your vision for the brand menu three years out relative to where it is today. And then I have one follow-up. Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Sure. Well, first and foremost, we want to offer items that fit into our Food with Integrity philosophy. Chipotle is about being able to purchase premium ingredients, the kinds that are in high-end markets and gourmet shops, and making these kinds of ingredients available for everybody's every day fast food, and we've been doing a really good job at that, making these things available. And they cost more, but we have an economic model that could support them. So that \u2013 it's really important to design a system that enables us to continue to do that. And as we evolve the menu, we also evolve the way we prepare and cook our foods in a restaurant. So, we can take advantage of technology, I think the new digitally-enhanced second make line is a great example of that, and I've been talking about that for well over a year. The labor efficiency that comes with that allows us to continue to invest in the business. And so, it also is a platform that allows us to create menu items that wouldn't fit into the linear assembly process that we have on the customer-facing make line. So, our ability to try different kinds of menu items that we wouldn't have been able to in the past, you'll start to see that ability in the future and that's \u2013 that really opens the doors much, much wider. So that's exciting. But again, Chipotle has traditionally had a very high frequency, repeat frequency with our loyal guests. And so, we want to develop foods that people like to eat often. And so, there's a lot of emphasis on things like salads and fresh veggies and things like this that customers want. But at the same time, they've asked for indulgent things like queso. So, we're going to have to do both ends of the spectrum and things in between, too. But again, we've set ourselves up to be very innovative and we've revamped the culinary development team and staffed it with some really high-powered folks. And so, we expect to see some really fun stuff come out of that. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. In other words, Jack, just \u2013 I know in the past people have asked about balance sheet leverage, just wondering whether you consider taking on any \u2013 take advantage of what has been an extended stock pullback, especially if you believe in the underlying, perhaps encouraging signs and recent results and optimism for the future. I was just wondering whether that's ever a consideration at this point. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Well, it's certainly something, Jeff, that we've talked about, but it's not something that we put a very high priority on right now. We know the most important thing we can do is get back to basics in our restaurants, execute our standards 100% of the time, and we know that's going to turn into guests wanting to come in more often. Right now, our balance sheet has been a strength through this. We've weathered the storm for a couple of years. We were able to buy back a lot of our stock, we're still able to grow at the appropriate rate, and so, the balance sheet has been a strength. If there's anything I hate to do is take that strength and turn it into a weakness, and now all of a sudden we're kind of squeezed by \u2013 kind of debt covenants or cash flow. So, I would not see us \u2013 expect to see us looking at leverage in the near future. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Okay, thanks, Jeff. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I would like to turn the call back to Mark Alexee for closing remarks. Mark Alexee - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Great. Thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. We really appreciate it. We look forward to sharing our fourth quarter and full-year results with you on February 1 of next year. Thanks so much. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve. Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon everyone. In 2018, Chipotle will celebrate its 25th anniversary. This is an ideal time to reflect on the things that have contributed to our success over the past 25 years, while at the same time, providing an update on the fundamental changes we are making across the business to enable us to get back on a strong growth trajectory and realize our vast potential. As I think back on the past 25 years, I'm extremely proud of the unique company we've created. Our success is based on our passion for serving great tasting wholesome food that's served in an interactive environment. It has been our vision, and the commitment of doing what is right for our guests, employees, suppliers, and farmers, the environment and animals well before these things were common in the world of fast food, all while delivering a superior economic model that has led to our success. When I started Chipotle, I wanted to show that just because food is served fast doesn't mean it has to be a typical fast food experience. It wasn't a commonly held view at the time, but it certainly has paid off. I continue to believe that this approach to serving nutritious, wholesome, and delicious food remains highly valued by our guests and can deliver strong returns to our shareholders. Now, after 25 years, we must navigate new challenges by continuing to evolve how we approach the business. Our results for the quarter clearly show that there is still work to be done to restore a strong growth and customer trust, and today, I want to discuss the progress we're making on a number of initiatives that will transform how we manage the company and that will provide a solid foundation for how we build the business going forward. Today, I want to talk about three key areas of focus : first, our operational changes and efforts to perfect the guest experience; second, enhancing the guest experience through innovations in digital and catering; and third, reinvesting in our existing restaurants to enhance guest convenience and improve the appearance and function of our restaurants. In addition, I'll provide an update on our CEO search. First, let me discuss the operational changes and efforts to perfect the dining experience. After spending time in our restaurants over the past few months, I've seen firsthand the impact Scott Boatwright and his team are having on our operations. Shifting our operational culture requires leadership, determination, and time to retrain and build new habits. Our field leaders are spending time with managers to focus on what it takes to effectively train our teams to deliver an excellent guest experience. Scott and his team have formalized the role of the manager and the role of the field leader to ensure all their efforts are focused on the guest experience. And our support teams are building extensive detailed training programs to provide the necessary tools for this type of change. We're also launching a dedicated centralized training program based in Denver. This program combines classroom teaching, which is new to Chipotle, with live in-store training in a certified Chipotle restaurant. The curriculum has been tailored to our field leaders to ensure we are effectively addressing the most important elements of delivering a great guest experience. That effort is beginning to pay off as we develop consistency around the speed of service and improving hospitality from every crew member. We're revisiting the concept of throughput, which has historically been an incredible strength of our business. As our training program continues to take hold, our teams will be primed to refocus on delivering excellent throughput in the restaurant again and will be looking at various ways to incentivize terrific throughput. When executed correctly with well-trained crew, throughput is one of the best tools we've had to build sales and to build our brand. We also completed the restructuring of our field leadership, reducing the number of regions and eliminating unnecessary layers above the restaurant. Our field leader ratios have been reduced, enabling our strong field leaders to spend more time in each restaurant. This has had a direct and lasting impact on the restaurant teams. And over the past six months, we've implemented a new guest satisfaction system in our restaurants and we are encouraged by improvements we've seen across all measures, including key areas of friendliness and ease of ordering. These renewed efforts come in addition to the incentive program changes we instituted at the restaurant level one year ago, which makes the guest experience a key component of incentive compensation for our restaurant and field teams. With early signs of an improved guest experience, we are excited to celebrate our 25th anniversary with all of our guests, employees, and partners. We will incorporate the 25th anniversary celebration into many of our marketing and promotional campaigns this year, and it will be a rallying point for our brand. We have passionate and loyal fans that love Chipotle and it's a great opportunity to share their stories along with reminding our guests of all the things that make us unique and special. We'll share more of this campaign with you on our first quarter call. Now, let me turn to how we are enhancing the guest experience to build sales through innovations in digital and catering. It's clear we must also ensure that we are offering new and convenient ways for our guests to interact with Chipotle. For much of our 25-year history, innovation at Chipotle rightfully focused on sourcing better ingredients, improving our cooking techniques, and making our kitchens and equipment more efficient. But over the last year, we've been building new competencies around improving the guest experience through technology and testing new or enhanced offerings. Each of these is designed to improve convenience, add interest to our menu, and deliver a better overall experience for our guests. Our digital sales continue to be the fastest growing part of our business. We hit new records in the fourth quarter as our second make-line sales were up 33% over the prior year. Our digital sales mix was 8.6% of sales while two of our regions have digital sales of more than 10% of their overall mix. We continue to be optimistic as we further market this capability and as guests increasingly order Chipotle through digital platforms. This digital sales growth has been led by mobile ordering, which is up 50% over last year. And the increase has been driven by the new version of our mobile app for Apple and Android. The app's new features include quick reorder of favorite or recent orders and the ability to receive, store, and redeem offers. The app also introduces new mobile pay options, a more user-friendly store locator, and a streamlined user experience with enhanced design, and guest response has been consistently positive since the launch. For instance, average monthly users on mobile have more than doubled since the release of the app. We're also seeing higher guest satisfaction in the restaurants that have the new second make-line, and we've seen further reduction in guest wait times to under 15 minutes, as we continue to optimize our Smarter Pickup Times. In 2018, we will accelerate the rollout of our digitally enabled second make-lines. These new lines enable a faster, more accurate experience for our digital customers and allow our crews to more easily support the higher sales volumes. Cumulatively, including new restaurants, we expect to have at least 30% of our restaurants outfitted with these new second make-lines by the end of 2018. We're prioritizing our markets and targeting locations that currently have the highest digital sales volumes to install these new make-lines. We're also testing new catering offerings which include options for smaller groups, more convenient packaging, and new lower priced options, all of which should help accelerate growth. The test includes catering options for as low as $9 per person and for groups as small as ten people, compared to our current catering which requires a minimum of 20 people starting at prices of $12 a person. We offer delivery support for catering in about 40% of our restaurants now and will look forward to expanding this ahead of our peak graduation season. With these initiatives taking hold, our catering sales have grown 20% over the last year. Catering is only a little more than 1% of our sales today, with tremendous opportunity for growth in the future. We're also creating new restaurant designs which are optimized for mobile ordering, more ordering options, better beverage presentation, and more comfortable dining areas. These new designs have the ability to be applied to our existing restaurants and to any new restaurants that we build. Additionally, we'll reinvest in our existing restaurant base as we launch a significant refresh and maintenance effort to improve the experience. We are replacing dim lighting, upgrading equipment on our service lines, and addressing all areas where restaurants have become worn, both inside and outside. We'll continue to expand our digital infrastructure at our restaurants, and will also replace aging equipment. Some of these projects are relatively small in scope but with the potential to deliver a significant impact. Jack's going to talk in more detail on the financial impacts of these initiatives. Chipotle has always been a purpose-driven company. We've had a relentless commitment to doing what's right for our guests and our employees. This year, we will invest more than one-third of our anticipated tax savings in our restaurant and support teams through a special bonus and expanded benefits. We will first invest more toward training programs for employees, including the formalized classroom program that we are establishing in Denver. We're also announcing a special bonus program for all employees this year, from hourly crew who will be eligible to earn $250 special bonus, to restaurant general managers who will be eligible to earn $1,000 special bonus. And we are expanding our competitive benefits program with paid maternity and paternity leave, and expanding our short-term disability and life insurance plans for hourly restaurant managers. All of these enhancements are especially important in today's low unemployment and highly competitive environment, and they come in addition to our average hourly wage that we pay, which is on pace to be more than $12 at the end of 2018 and in addition to our unique slate of benefits that we offer including discounted college tuition and tuition reimbursement for salaried and hourly employees, twice annual merit increases, paid vacation, and paid sick time, and stock awards at the restaurant manager level. We have always been proud of our ability to attract and retain people who share our passion for creating an extraordinary guest experience, and our employees have rallied around our purpose to cultivate nourished communities where wholesome food is enjoyed every day. I want to thank them for their hard work and dedication to making Chipotle an amazing experience. Chipotle is a very special brand. The past couple of years have presented a set of challenges, but I know that the changes we have made are the right ones to help us move toward achieving our full potential. We will continue to focus on our long-term success and we'll continue to fight to preserve the things that make Chipotle special. An important part of this will be to bring in a proven leader with demonstrated success in meeting the kinds of challenges we currently face. The search for a new CEO is well under way, and as soon as we have found the right person, I'll transition to the role of Executive Chairman. The board and I are committed to bringing in a world class leader with demonstrated expertise to improve execution, build guest trust, and drive sales. We do not have an update on timing today, but we'll share news of our decision as soon as the process is complete. We firmly believe that a new CEO with a passion for driving excellence across every aspect of our business will be another important step in our growth, and I'm optimistic as we look forward to the next 25 years. I'll now turn the call over to Jack. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Last year held its full share of challenges, but we begin 2018 with optimism that the changes made so far and the changes and investments we'll make in 2018 will establish the foundation for a strong future. Our restaurant teams and field support teams are more committed than ever to delivering an excellent guest experience and will continue to emphasize the guest as we significantly increase our focus and investment on training. We've established incentives for our managers and field leaders to continue to elevate the guest experience and to build sales. Our second make-line sales including online, mobile and catering are the fastest growing parts of the business and we expect that growth to continue or even accelerate. We also plan to invest much more in our existing restaurants during 2018 and beyond to create a better dining environment, but ultimately to improve the overall experience and flow of our restaurants. I'll begin by reviewing results for the fourth quarter and full year, and then provide details related to our capital reinvesting plans and tax savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. For the fourth quarter, we reported $1.1 billion in sales on comp sales growth of 0.9%. Our reported comps include a 60-basis-point decrease as we lapped Chiptopia deferred revenue in Q4 of last year. If you recall, we recognized an additional 60-basis-point benefit in sales comp related to the deferred revenue in Q4 2016 and now that reduces our comp in the current period. We'll have a similar decrease in the first quarter of 2018 of about 50 basis points to our comp. Our restaurant level margins were 14.9% in the quarter, and we generated $1.55 in earnings per diluted share. Our EPS in the quarter benefited by about $0.21 related to the recent U.S. tax law changes. For the full year, we reported $4.5 billion of sales on a sales comp increase of 6.4%, which includes a 30-basis-point benefit related to Chiptopia. Restaurant level margins were 16.9%, and we generated diluted earnings per share of $6.17. The Q4 underlying comp of 1.5% before the 60-basis-point effect of Chiptopia was driven by a higher average check as we expanded our menu price increase to an additional 900 restaurants in November, bringing the total menu price impact during the quarter to about 240 basis points. Average check also benefited by about 200 basis points from queso. And queso continued to add about 200 basis points to the average check in January as guests are currently adding queso in a little more than 10% of our transactions. Paid traffic in the quarter was down about 3% due to the negative transaction trends that began in July of last year. January 2018 sales comp was 3.4%. We had one extra trading day in the month as we opened on New Year's Day for the first time. And that day contributed about 240 basis points and will account for just under 1% in the comp for the first quarter. Sales were diversely impacted during the first three weeks of January from the series of winter storms that impacted most of the country. As the weather has normalized over the past two weeks, our comps have been running in the 2.5% to the 3.5% range. First quarter comparisons will get tougher as we enter mid February and March, as warm weather last year caused our comps to surge, essentially bringing our normal seasonal spring sales bump earlier than normal. If our recent sales dollar trends continue through the first quarter, we would expect a comp of between 1% and 2% before the impact of Chiptopia. Our full year comp guidance for 2018 is in the low single digits with lower sales comps expected in the first half of the year due to the tougher comparison, then improving in the second half as comparisons ease. In addition to the menu price increase last November, we completed the final round of price increases in January in about 1,000 remaining restaurants or about 40% of our restaurants. The average price increase in these markets was about 5%, and we expect resistance of around 20% or less. We expect the average check will continue to benefit the comp by about 2% from guests adding queso through the first 8 months of 2018 until we lap the queso rollout in September. Of course, all this means we will likely continue to see negative transactions until we lap the beginning of the negative transaction trend which began in July. Food costs during the quarter were 34.2%, down from 35.3% in the prior year and down from 35% in Q3. The decrease from last year was driven by menu price increases, better management of paper and packaging inventories, and lower priced avocados. We expect relatively stable prices in 2018 including for avocados which along with the price increase should lower our food costs to the low to mid 33% range. California avocado growth should be on the upswing for their alternate-bearing crop this summer and we're fortunate that the recent wildfires in California are not expected to impact supply. Labor costs in the fourth quarter were 27.5%, flat with the prior year. Higher wage inflation of 5% was offset by a combination of factors including labor efficiencies due to fewer promotions, lower insurance and benefit costs, and slight leverage from pricing. Since early 2014, crew wages and benefits have increased by cumulative 29%, but we've only increased pricing by cumulative 12%. Our restaurant managers and crews are running some of the most efficient restaurant labor deployment we've seen in years. The labor pressures will continue at this level because of wage inflation, softer transaction trends and as we add our enhanced benefits that Steve discussed. Our labor as a percent of sales is typically flat from Q4 into Q1, although we anticipate it to increase slightly in Q1 related to regulatory minimum wage increases as of January 1 combined with the reinvestment into our employees funded by the tax savings. Occupancy costs for the fourth quarter were 7.6% of sales versus 7.4% last year. The higher occupancy costs were driven by inflation from renewals and slightly higher average rents from new restaurants. We anticipate new restaurant openings in 2018 to continue to have modestly higher average rents than existing restaurants due to refocusing our development pipeline with a heavier weighting toward proven markets. As a percentage of sales, occupancy for the full year should be about in line with 2017 in the low to mid-7% range as a percent of sales. Other operating costs were 15.8% of sales in the quarter, a decrease from 16.3% last year. Our marketing and promo costs were 3.8% of sales in the quarter, which is a decrease of about 100 basis points compared to last year. Our other operating costs also included 50 basis points of incremental cost related to maintenance and repairs. Maintenance and repairs is expected to remain at elevated levels during 2018, which I'll explain more fully in a few minutes. In 2018, we anticipate marketing and promo activity will be at or slightly above 3% of sales. Marketing and promo costs will be slighter higher in the second and third quarters with lower spending in Q1 and Q4. For the full year, we anticipate other operating costs to be about the same as last year as savings from the lower marketing and promo will be reinvested into existing restaurants with higher maintenance and repairs. With normal lower seasonal sales in the first quarter and the increased reinvestment in our restaurants, we would anticipate Q1 other operating expenses to be right around 15% of sales. So, overall in Q1, the restaurant level margins are typically similar to the fourth quarter with lower expected food and other operating costs and the full benefit of the price increase offset by higher maintenance and repairs investment and the investment in the special bonus for employees, Q1 margins should be in the 16% to 16.5% range. G&A costs for the full year 2017 were 6.6% of sales, or a total of $296 million. And this includes $30 million related to the data security incident from April 2017, $60 million in stock compensation, and $8 million in our employee bonus program. During 2017, our employee bonus program underperformed our targets. For the full year 2018, we anticipate G&A costs will be about $330 million, and this includes around $66 million for stock comp, $18 million for our employee bonus program, as we expect to return to paying bonuses at our target during 2018, $12 million for one-time executive retention bonuses and stock grants, and $12 million for our biennial all-manager conference. We expect underlying recurring G&A to grow by about $25 million after three years of flat G&A, despite the fact that we opened more than 650 restaurants during this time. The $25 million includes the formalized new training programs and the one-time special bonuses for staff related to the savings from tax rate reductions. We plan to invest a total of about $300 million in capital expenses in 2018, an increase from our 2017 investment of $217 million. For the first time ever, our capital investment into existing restaurants will outpace our investment in new restaurant openings. The total CapEx will be funded from our cash flow from operations and includes several components. First, in addition to normal ongoing upkeep of our restaurants, for which we would typically invest around $10,000 per restaurant, or around $24 million, we'll invest another $50 million to fund the new refresh and maintenance program that Steve introduced. This $50 million is a discrete one-time investment that will average about $20,000 per restaurant and it will allow us to fully assess the interiors of every single restaurant, improve efficiencies, ensure that the environments are warm and welcoming for our guests. This focus on improving our restaurants is also driving higher maintenance and repair expenses, which we expect will continue throughout 2018. In early tests, we have seen modest investments can have a significant influence on the atmosphere for our guests. In addition, we'll invest into new growth initiatives, including about $45 million to continue to retrofit our digitally-enhanced second make-lines into existing restaurants. Including new restaurants, the digitally-enhanced second make-line will be in about 1,000 restaurants by the end of the year. We'll also invest about $15 million to improve IT infrastructure, a portion of which will support and enhance our digital programs and digital experience. Our digital investments are targeted toward the fastest growing piece of our business, and will be accompanied by other digital-experience enhancements and focused marketing efforts to continue to encourage digital ordering. Beyond digital, we'll invest about $10 million in designing new prototype restaurants. The results from these prototypes will inform both new restaurant design and remodels of our older restaurants in 2019 and in 2020. We also plan to invest around $25 million into initiatives around optimizing our energy uses in our restaurants and introduce better equipment to cook our food, such as a new rice cooker to make our restaurants more efficient. And while we're investing more aggressively into our existing restaurants, our development pipeline remains healthy and we expect to build and open around 130 to 150 new restaurants during 2018. The majority of new restaurants will continue to be built in our proven markets where we've had a loyal and growing customer base. New restaurants opened during 2017 performed at about 75% of our average sales volumes and continue to provide a strong return during the first year of operations. Our net costs to build these restaurants will be slightly higher in 2018 as every site now incorporates the new digitally enabled second make-line. And finally we'll invest about $25 million into other general corporate initiatives which includes the consolidation of our two separate offices in Denver so that we can create a more efficient and more collaborative environment. Effective tax rate for the full year 2017 was 36.1%, compared with 40.8% in 2016, and for the quarter our tax rate was 28.8%. This lower quarterly tax rate resulted from remeasuring our deferred tax liability at the 21% corporate federal tax rate following the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act becoming law in late December. The full year rate is lower than 2016 due to the tax rate changes along with lower state tax rates. We expect the 2018 effective full year tax rate to be between 30% and 31%, with an underlying effective tax rate to be in the 27% to 28% range. There are a few moving pieces in this new rate. Relative to our normalized tax rate of about 39%, the last few years, our federal tax rate will decrease by 1,400 basis points as a result of the federal tax rate changes. But offsetting this decrease, our state taxes will be higher by about 100 basis points to 200 basis points due to the reduced benefit of deducting state taxes at the new lower federal tax rate. And under the new federal tax law we can no longer expense the full cost of our employee meals for tax purposes which is a substantial benefit that we offer our employees. That adds another 100 basis points to our tax rate. This underlying effective tax rate of 27% to 28% will then be impacted by prior and future stock based compensation plans. We currently have deferred tax assets related to outstanding non-vested stock award that contain market and performance conditions. If market conditions are not achieved, then we may not realize the benefit of these deferred tax assets which will result in a higher effective tax rate in future periods. Our current outstanding awards such as the 2015 and 2016 performance stock grant, there are estimates that these award either may not vest or may vest at lower realized values than originally anticipated. Under either scenario we would not benefit from the initial deferred tax asset which would negatively impact our effective tax rate by around 300 basis points to 400 basis points. Overall corporate tax law changes will result in tax savings of around $40 million to $50 million in 2018. We plan to invest more than one-third of these savings in our people with investments in special bonuses to our crew, managers and support staff, investment in employee training, and enhanced employee benefits. The remainder of the tax savings will help fund our investment to enhance existing restaurants. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, and we finished the year with $509 million in cash and investments and generated $467 million in cash from operations during 2017. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $77 million of our stock at an average price of $297 per share and we repurchased $284 million in stock during the full year 2017. Even with our increased investment in existing restaurants in 2018, we still expect to opportunistically repurchase shares throughout the year, albeit at a lower level than last year. As should be expected, our outlook for 2018 does not include any potential strategic changes that may be driven by a new CEO. Despite a challenging year, we feel that we have a lot of momentum and energy throughout the company heading into 2018. We're more committed than ever to continue to perfect our dining experience and to build our sales. The investments that we're making in our people, into growing our digital and catering business, and investing in new innovation will not only help set up the foundation for a successful 2018, but also for the next 25 years. Thank you, and we'll now open the lines for questions. Operator : At this time we will be conducting a question and answer session. Our first question is with John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. First just on top line drivers, if you could comment about in 2018 how you're viewing either product development differently or approaching marketing differently. Does queso give you more confidence, for example, in more new product introductions in 2018 to drive traffic? And when you think about marketing, the same question. Your approach has been non-traditional in the past. Does that approach continue to work or do you think that this is the time to pivot to maybe a more traditional marketing message to get traffic going again? Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, John. So we've learned a lot over the last year as we've pivoted toward more traditional marketing using television in particular. So this year, we're going to do a number of things. Our marketing plan will consist as it traditionally has of three big components over the year, three big advertising components. So in the spring, we will launch another advertising campaign. This time though it'll be using addressable TV rather than broadcast TV, which is a learning that we took away from fall, where a lot of that TV we're reaching lapsed customers who aren't the best target for us. So we're really focusing in more with this addressable TV on the new and current customers that we have. And then in the summer, we'll head into our 25th anniversary marketing campaign which is largely targeted toward existing customers although certainly it will reach new as well. And then in the fall, there will be another large advertising campaign which again is likely to include television. So the pivot I think toward more traditional advertising will continue, the one that we started last year. That's not to say that we won't do more non-traditional things, as we always have. The notable difference I think for this year will be in the addition of a much more robust CRM platform and the inclusion of a loyalty program which we should see in the second half of the year. So that'll give us \u2013 the combination of this more strategic approach to advertising, particularly the use of this addressable TV, along with a more robust CRM platform should allow us to reach the right customers more effectively. So I think it is overall a pivot to slightly more traditional, if you will, advertising, but we're doing it in a very targeted way. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And, Jack, if I could just sneak in one follow-up. You gave a number of detailed items around cost items individually. Could you just, if you were to hit your low single-digit comp guidance for the year in 2018, where do you think store margins land on a basis of what you just described? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, John, I think, we'll be in the \u2013 probably in the upper teens, maybe in the 17.5% to 18%, 18.5% range, something like that. A couple percent margin means that we would delever on the labor line with labor inflation running in the mid-single digits, and with only running a 2%, even though that's driven by price, that means we're still running negative transactions. And so I think it would be in that \u2013 probably constrained in that 17.5% to 18%, maybe as high as 18.5% if we really get cooperation from commodities. We've also got some of the one-time things I mentioned as well, like the bonus that we're going to pay for tax savings. And then the additional M&R, maintenance and repair, that we're going to, in addition to extra capital, we're really going to place a heavy focus on making sure our restaurants look, feel, and are a wonderful environment for our customers. So I think that's about where you can expect margins to hit for the year, John. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is from Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Good afternoon. I just have two quick questions. The first one, on point number 2 on innovations around digital and catering, how does loyalty fit into the mix there? And when might you be willing to launch a loyalty program? Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Well, as I just said, we expect to launch a loyalty program which is part of a larger CRM effort in the second half of the year. So the program is being designed as we speak. And so loyalty is a subset of the larger CRM effort, which will be an important part of all of our digital marketing, as well as catering, as marketing catering, obviously as those are things that we market to people who we know as existing customers. So they're very much linked. Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.: And will you be \u2013 you'll get the customer data so that you can reach out to them. And is this a surprise and delight or points or dollar based program? Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Well, yeah, I mean, absolutely. I mean, knowing the customer and having that one to one relationship with them is the central focus of it. The actual structure of the program is not something that we're talking about today, but absolutely everything is on the table with regard to that. Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay, and then just a second question in regards to the 130 to 150 new stores. To figure out how to model those, any sequence you would offer quarterly? And then are these new stores in new markets? Are they in existing markets? And is there any international growth to speak of? Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, Nicole, they should be reasonably even-filled throughout the year. You know, timelines always change throughout the year, but there's nothing out of the ordinary in terms of the way that they fall in through the quarters. And most of them will be in proven markets. We still will seed a few here and there in some of the newer markets, but most of them, way over \u2013 way more than 80% should be in our proven and established markets, which gives us greater confidence that they should open and generate an attractive return right out of the box. Mark Crumpacker - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: And none planned in international. Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: And nothing planned in international right now, Nicole. Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Nicole. Operator : Our next question is with David Tarantino with Robert Baird. Please proceed with your question. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: A couple questions on the traffic trends. First, Jack, on the quarter-to-date commentary, I think you sort of pointed to an underlying trend of around 2.5% to 3.5%. Could you just confirm the level of pricing that you have in that equation so that we can get to kind of an underlying traffic number? I believe you might be running 5% pricing or higher plus queso. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, it's right at 5%, David. There were some markets that had extremely high local costs, especially labor, so, market-by-market you would see some markets that were a little above 5%, but the overall weighted average across the country is running about 5%. We typically model in about a 20% resistance, so that 5% converts to about 4%. We might see less resistance than that, so, I would expect the comp to benefit somewhere between 4% and 5%. And then we're running 2% added to the check because of queso, so when we're running a 3%, for example, 3% positive comp, if you assume 4% from pricing and a couple percent from queso, you could back into a negative transaction of somewhere in the 3% range. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it. And then your guidance for the year seems to assume that doesn't get a whole lot better, despite everything you're doing. Is that correct? If you look at sort of the seasonally adjusted traffic trends, are you assuming much improvement? Or are you just assuming that the year-over-year number gets better when you cycle the stepdown you saw in the second half of the year? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Well, yeah, there's a couple things, David. One, we do assume the back half of the year, the underlying trends do get better because comparisons get better. When we compare against July, we're comparing against the beginning of the negative transaction, so we do think the transactions get better. But we have a couple things also that roll off. We have some pricing that rolls off in April. We will compare against queso launch in September and it will compare against the pricing in November, as well. Of course, we hope that we will build even more momentum, so we're not being overly bullish with our guidance. We're working on a number of things from an ops standpoint, from a digital standpoint, Mark mentioned loyalty, so we're hoping that we can spark a more positive transaction trend, but based on how tough it's been the last couple years to get that momentum going, we think this is the right level of guidance. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Makes sense. And then one more if Scott Boatwright is available to answer. There's a comment about guest satisfaction scores and a new system that you're using to measure those and some early signs being good on your progress there. So, I was just wondering if Scott could comment on sort of where you think you are today on those metrics and where you think you need to be to drive much better traffic trends. Thanks. Scott Boatwright - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Hi, David, Scott here. Thanks for the question. We are using Medallia as our partner in the space. And we have just really started garnering the level of survey volume necessary for statistical relevance probably over the course of the last four to five months, and we have seen pretty significant growth in overall satisfaction since September of last year with a steady increase. And February is still ahead of January, although not fully baked, but feel really good about our current trends. I feel like we are really regaining consumer confidence all across the country by some of the steps that we took later in last year to really shore-up some of our operational deficiencies, and we'll see that to continue to improve. I am encouraged by the trend at this point. But to the last part of your question, I think to be best-in-class, we probably need to continue to improve probably another 600 basis points, 700 basis points from where we sit today. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is with Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: Good afternoon. A few questions. I just want to clarify, Jack, on that 1% to 2% comp for the first quarter, are you including the New Year's Day benefit in that? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: I am, Sharon, yeah. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: The New Year's Day overall for the quarter will give us about 1%. So that does imply that we're looking about just \u2013 on top of that a 1% positive, net 1% to 2% range. And the reason is just that our sales really surged significantly in the middle of February, and we're about to go up against those numbers. So, if we're lucky, we'll get mild weather again, but again, if we had kind of normal winter weather compared to how warm it was last year, 1% to 2% is about where we expect the quarter to fall. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then I guess a question on the CEO search. I think, Steve, you mentioned being a purpose-driven company, and clearly, the culture has been one of the key hallmarks over time of Chipotle. As you look for that new CEO, is that purpose-driven dynamic? Is that a guardrail on that search? Or would somebody coming in kind of have free reign to take Chipotle in the direction he or she thinks it should go? Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Sure, Sharon. You know, it's a delicate balance bringing in a new CEO. Of course, you've heard of examples where new CEOs have come in but have not really been allowed to act as a CEO, and I fully intend to have the new CEO be in charge. It's been great spending time with a number of candidates, and one thing has been consistent though, and that is how strongly Chipotle has impressed these folks, and it's based in the purpose. So many of the candidates come from the restaurant industry and have been \u2013 either have led them or been a key player in these brands. And while they've enjoyed a lot of success in their companies, they've never had the kind of purpose that we've had at Chipotle, which is I think very, very exciting to all of them. I think it's not lost on them that you can really have both. You can have a purpose and you can have a product that's very, very popular with consumers, and you can have a great economic model. And for 25 years we never compromised on that. We had it all. And we need to get back on track and build momentum again, and all of the new CEOs realize that. I don't think you're going to see a situation where someone says \"To hell with food with integrity. We're going to buy cheap commodity meat now and really turn this thing around.\" I just don't worry that that kind of a thing would happen. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. Operator : Our next question is with Sara Senatore with AB (44:46). Please proceed with your question. Unknown Speaker : Hi. Thanks. One question and one follow-up, please. So, the question is on the CapEx and some of the investment in the existing stores. I think the comment was that you're seeing some real benefits in terms of customer experience. But is that translating into same-store sales lifts? I think a lot of times in the industry we see lifts in the kind of mid-single digit range when there are some upgrades to the stores. So, just trying to get a sense if that guest experience improvement that you're seeing is actually also translating into top line. And then I do have a question on margins. Scott Boatwright - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Hi, Sara, this is Scott Boatwright. It's a fantastic question. Once I joined the brand back last summer, I spent a great deal of time in our restaurants really from coast to coast and recognized there was a great deal of deferred maintenance across the country that needed to be addressed to ensure that we are best on block in each of the trade areas in which we operate. Unfortunately, Sara, those changes don't really alter the facade or the exterior of the Chipotle restaurants we've been talking about. So it wouldn't garner additional traffic, but I do feel, as a great number of our guests dine in that changing the experience for those folks will, although a slow build, will contribute to the overall sales performance here in 2018. Unknown Speaker : Great. Thank you. And then just on the margins, Jack, if you could talk a little bit about I think a year ago or what have you, we talked about 20% restaurant margins at $2 million AUVs, and now it sounds like maybe you're looking for 18% restaurant margins at roughly that number or even a little bit higher. Granted that you're reinvesting some of the tax savings as is the rest of the industry. But I guess is that 20% number off the table? And a related question, do you rethink how you approach pricing given that the nature of your pricing has meant that you've really lagged the cost inflation by quite a bit? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah. It's a good question. And let me try to answer it this way. Let me go back to Q2 of last year when our margin was at right around 19%, 18.9% or 19%, and then let's talk about what we can expect in the second quarter of this year, and that might be the best kind of way to show kind of before and after because second quarter of last year was right before we had the July where we started the negative transaction slide. So I would expect, Karen, that we'd have about the same margin in the second quarter of 2018. Unknown Speaker : Sara. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: I'm sorry, Sara. That we'd have about the same margin in the second quarter of 2018, about 19%, but there's a lot of pushes and pulls. First of all, we're having a net inflection point of about 500 to 600 basis points since the transaction trend last year. We were running positive 3% and then we switched to a negative 3%. So that 500 to 600 basis point, that impacts the margin by negative about 1.6%. The ongoing labor inflation that we've seen is about 1.2%, 1.3% or so. And that's running about a 5% margin on top of our 26% labor. The menu price increases is helping us by 300 or so basis points. And so the menu price increase essentially offsets the deleverage from the comp and then the labor inflation. And then we have pushes in terms of this year we're expecting lower marketing and promo but a little bit higher maintenance and repairs. The maintenance and repairs we think is going to be a this year item, not a forever item, but still. So you've got all these pushes and pulls, and so while our model still has the ability at higher volumes, if we can get transaction momentum growing, we can lever the model. We've seen us do that year after year after year. But this negative transaction hit is taking hits into the margin and then menu price increase, which adds 300 basis points to the model, is eaten all up by the delever and then by the inflation. And so the important thing for us is to hopefully get some of these things that we're focused on to start transaction momentum, start positive transaction. And then in terms of menu price, we certainly are open to the idea instead of waiting three years and raising prices to perhaps, especially that labor inflation is an every year thing at this level, perhaps we take a smaller increase every year, just kind of hold on to our margins in terms of regular ongoing inflation. So I hope that helps in terms of comparing the quarters year to year because it really is a dramatic different picture since the transactions turned negative. Unknown Speaker : Thank you. That's helpful. Operator : Our next question is with Jason West with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah, thanks. I'm just trying to understand the level of investments that you guys need to make in the stores. You talked about some refresh of equipment and the ambiance, lighting and things like that. But then you also touched on a more significant prototype change with maybe things like mobile ordering pickup stations and things like that. So what is the plan there in terms of \u2013 I know this year, it sounds like more of a refresh plan, but then is it more of a full remodel in the future or are you doing both at the same time? Can you talk about that a bit? Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, it's actually both at the same time. It's really low-hanging fruit to change light bulbs and to freshen with new deep thirds on the service line, the new stainless steel pans that aren't bent, things like this that really cause customers to notice that there's something different. It's shinier, it's brighter, it's cleaner. And we're going to continue to find those kinds of opportunities. Right now, we have engaged with three different architectural firms to create the next version of the Chipotle experience, and we've deliberately asked them to remodel existing restaurants so that this new experience can be applied to existing restaurants as well as brand new restaurants. And we'll start to see some of those come online shortly. We've got three of them now mocked up as models in full-scale cardboard models in a warehouse, and we've walked through them and kicked the tires and really felt what that experience is going to be like. It's really exciting. It combines the traditional Chipotle experience along with things like digital pickup, whether it's in-store digital or out of store digital, and grab and go. And it also allows for potential new menu items. So really exciting stuff and really preparing ourselves for the next 25 years. Operator : Our next question is with Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Another question on the CapEx (52:24) side of things. So with this $50 million of spending on really maintenance this year, it sounds like you roll off some of that more as one time than ongoing in nature. Would that rolling off give you sort of more flexibility to then increase the \u2013 or reaccelerate unit growth? Or what's sort of the governing factor on maybe getting back to prior peaks of unit growth? Thanks. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, I think on a theoretical basis, it could lead to that, but I don't think it's a matter of access to capital because we've got enough access to capital through our operations and through our balance sheet to do the remodels, to do the repairs that Steve talked about, the bringing our restaurants up to standard, and we can accelerate growth. I think the biggest driver right now is we want to give our ops teams a chance to really get on solid footing. The things that Scott has put into place have really just started to take hold. We're going to put a huge emphasis on training, a refocus on training so that we can have confidence that all of our teams, all of our managers, all of our crews will know what our standards are, they can execute the standards and they'll deliver an excellent guest experience including great throughput. We haven't had a great throughput year in the last few years, and that takes a lot of training. So I think the new store growth, reaccelerating that is going to be much more about how we feel about the ops teams and are they on solid footing, are our training programs, are they really taking hold. And then I think we'll redeploy capital into the new stores. So I wouldn't say just because capital frees up that that automatically would move into a new store. And we're not commenting specifically on 2019 right now. I think it'd be prudent for us to get through at least half if not three quarters of 2018, and then we'll assess at that time and talk about what 2019 and beyond looks like for growth. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our final question is with Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Steve, I believe it was last quarter you talked about the NEXT Team whether it was for menu innovation or new segments and what not. And I know you talked about how queso was I guess their first foray. So I'm just wondering with greater time now under your belt as you think about that NEXT Team, what's the early evolution or thoughts around I think you mentioned new segments or new day parts? How would you prioritize the different opportunities that perhaps they're coming up with as you think about the next many years. And I know you just mentioned kind of new menu items, so what do you think kind of the genesis of what's the outcome of that NEXT Team in terms of over the next year or so? Steve Ells - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Sure, I think the NEXT Team's biggest opportunity is to always look at our core menu and make sure that we're cooking better food, we're sourcing better food, we have better ingredients, we're improving our preparation techniques, our cooking techniques, our serving techniques. It's what drove our business for the first couple of decades, taking a core group of menu items and continually improving them, not only through food with integrity but through better restaurant execution. So that's a priority. But additionally, they need to work on new menu items and they have a whole host of menu items. New menu items at a place like Chipotle is tricky though. It's tricky not only because we've had the same menu for basically 25 years, but because of the linear format, it's not like you can put a whole new thing up on the menu board like at a typical fast-food place. Ingredients sort of become part of the overall offering, so it's a tricky proposition. But it's something that we're working really hard on. There are exciting new offerings that are around things like salads and different kinds of grains and also exploration of traditional things and these are things that customers are asking for, things like nachos and quesadillas. And so, how to integrate those into our service format so that we can maintain throughput and sort of the level of execution that we've relied on in the past is tricky. So, that's something that they're focusing on also. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And then, Jack, I just want to clarify. I think you said more than one-third of the tax savings you're going to reinvest. It sounds like a lot of it is more one-time in nature versus ongoing, but did you say something about the remaining two-thirds? I thought you said maybe you'd be reinvesting that, as well, or should we assume that the remainder gets returned to shareholders? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Well, in essence, what we did say is that that will help us fund the increase in CapEx, but we'll continue, Jeff, we'll continue to generate more than enough capital from operations to support our CapEx. We still have a strong balance sheet, so you can expect us to continue to return cash to shareholder. Not necessarily an incremental amount. I think the incremental amount that we're getting from taxes is going to be funneled into the extra CapEx and into our existing restaurants. We still have room that we can return some of our capital to shareholders, as well, through buybacks. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over back to Mark Alexee for closing remarks. Mark Alexee - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Great. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to sharing our Q1 results with you, which again is planned for Tuesday, April 24. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

With that, I will now turn the call over to Brian Niccol. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Coralie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm excited to be talking to you today on my first earnings call with Chipotle. Chipotle is such a strong brand with incredible equity built over the last 25 years, and I couldn't be more excited about our future. One thing is very clear to me, consumers love our great tasting food and appreciate that our food is made with integrity. I have admired Chipotle for many years and I'm excited to have the opportunity to lead the future direction of this incredible company. Before I get into the details of this call, I'd like to start by recognizing Steve Ells for creating this amazing concept. And for the last 25 years, leading it to become one of the most important restaurant brands of our time. I thank Steve for the invaluable time he spent bringing me up to speed over the past several weeks, and I deeply appreciate him fully handing over the reins to me and giving me the autonomy to lead, innovate, and create the new strategy that will ensure our growth for the future. Going forward, Steve has embraced his new role as Executive Chairman. We're fortunate to be able to leverage his creativity and expertise as a culinarian, a visionary and our founder. For those of you who don't know me very well, I'd like to share some of my key beliefs and leadership principles, so you know what to expect going forward. I believe it is important to focus on results over activity, to hold people accountable, and to be stewards of our business. I believe in the power of innovation and that to be successful we must create and lead change. I also believe in a winning work ethic and that to win we need to have an external focus with the ability to quickly read and react to change. And I believe in the power of people so it's important to me that we create a culture that is focused on running and supporting great restaurants, putting the customer first, living our purpose, innovating for today and tomorrow, and supporting and recognizing each other. Before I share my view on what changes we need to make, I thought I would start by telling you what is not going to change. We will continue to serve high quality, great tasting food that consumers crave. We will also continue to focus on improving operations and fixing and modernizing the foundation of our company. With that said you will see us doubling down on our purpose and our guest experience. We will get better at innovation and putting customers front and center. We will focus on execution, which rests on simple choices, clear goals and consistent measures. We are also upgrading our capabilities to innovate across our business. Specifically, we will provide greater consumer access including through delivery and catering, enhance the digital experience, innovate around our menu, and improve our restaurant design. We're working on building a world class executive team and an organization built for growth. In the last year, we've added new leaders across operations, communications, marketing, and human resources. Since our last earnings announcement, we added Chris Brandt as Chief Marketing Officer and just this week, Marissa Andrada joined Chipotle as Chief Human Resources Officer. Chris Brandt is a seasoned veteran and is quickly assessing the changes needed across marketing, so we can get back to emphasizing the craveability of our food and expanding brand loyalty among consumers. Having worked with Chris in the past, I can vouch for his proven track record of delivering innovation that is good for consumers and operations and that provides the financial outcomes needed to grow transactions and sales. I'm confident Chris will quickly find ways to increase our brand relevance and ensure our advertising spend is working harder for us. Marissa Andrada has extensive experience in senior human resource roles in prominent consumer brands and I'm excited that she has joined our team. Marissa's leadership will be essential as we look to strengthen our organization, and ensure we have the right structuring capabilities to achieve our strategy and build a culture of innovation and recognition. We are creating a path to performance and we are in the process of establishing the strategies to get there. I plan to share more details with you on a special call before our next earnings announcement with more details around how we will do these five things. First, grow sales, transactions, margin, and restaurants. Second, elevate our brand relevance and further our brand purpose. Third, build the right structure and capabilities to sustain performance. Fourth, create a people recognition and innovation culture. And fifth, run great restaurants that deliver best-in-class financial performance. In the coming months you will see us piloting various tests across key innovation focus areas such as consumer access, the digital experience, our menu and restaurant experience, and realigning the organization to support the go-forward strategy. I do want to acknowledge that there's a lot of great work underway and we are starting to get some traction. Curt Garner's work on the mobile app is paying dividends, and I'm excited about the continued benefits of the digitally enhanced second make-line, which is now in 237 restaurants. Order accuracy has improved in those restaurants, leading to a nearly 20% improvement in customer feedback. Digital sales are our fastest growing area with growth of 20% year-over-year and now represent 8.8% of sales in the first quarter. The customer experience with mobile sales is also improving as our average wait times for mobile orders are down by more than half since launching Smarter Pickup Times. Curt and I are excited to continue driving progress in these areas which we believe will help us bring Chipotle to more people in ways that customers appreciate. We are seeing improvements in operations under Scott Boatwright's leadership. I've spent a lot of time in restaurants with Scott over the last several weeks and I'm impressed with our teams and their dedication to operational excellence. The plans Scott put in place last fall have created a culture of accountability in the field, our design provide a great guest experience, and are built on a strong foundation of food safety. Most importantly, our customers are noticing and I'm confident we are focused on the right measures. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but I'm optimistic about the future of Chipotle. We have a strong economic model, a loyal customer base, and a powerful purpose. With that, I look forward to sharing more details with you on the special call I mentioned earlier. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jack Hartung to provide a financial update. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased with our performance in the first quarter as comp sales accelerated slightly, margins expanded, and earnings per share grew. And though it was a solid quarter, we realize we have much more work ahead. Since Brian's arrival, we've been taking a fresh look at every element of our business. We're committed to running great restaurants; putting our customers first; staying true to our purpose; embracing innovation in menu, digital, access and restaurants; improving our execution capabilities; and strengthening our culture internally. We're confident that these are the right areas of focus to drive strong performance and increase shareholder value on a sustainable long-term basis. Before I go through the financial results, I want to highlight some important operational accomplishments this quarter. As Brian mentioned, Scott's plan to instill a culture of accountability in the field is starting to get the attention of our customers, as internal customer satisfaction scores have increased significantly since last summer. Employee turnover at the crew level has improved to the best levels we've seen in many years. We have much more to do, but the culture of accountability, the heightened focus on training, and the improved leadership structure in the field is beginning to drive results that are precursors to sustained comp sales improvement. Brian highlighted the strong improvement in our digital sales, which grew 20% year-over-year and now accounts for 8.8% of total sales. Mobile sales alone grew 41% year-over-year. And these orders are all fulfilled on our second make-line, which we believe to be a competitive advantage and that we will continue to invest in to make the customer experience as convenient as possible, allowing us to continue to grow digital sales. The majority of second make-line orders are app and web orders, but also include third-party delivery orders and catering. The surge in mobile sales since relaunching our app late last year gives us confidence that our customers appreciate the great experience. We're proud to say that we were notified just this week that we won the People's Choice Webby Award for best user interface for a mobile app. The Webby is an award for excellence on the Internet and is one of the most prestigious industry awards. Catering is approximately 1% of sales and remains a large untapped opportunity on which we have increased our focus. We recently expanded catering delivery availability to 1,500 restaurants from 940, and on average, we see about a 15% lift in catering sales when we add delivery. And we're decreasing group size minimums and we're testing lower per person pricing options to expand our catering reach. Our delivery sales continue to grow at a rapid pace. And when our delivery partners offer free delivery at Chipotle to build their customer base, our customers respond in a big way, as they did during Super Bowl weekend when delivery volumes increased nearly 250%. We'll continue to expand the number of delivery partners we work with, and we'll look to partner with them to offer compelling options to our customers. Turning to financial results, we generated revenue of $1.1 billion during the quarter, an increase of 7.4% from last year on comp sales growth of 2.2%. And that's on top of last year's 17% Q1 comp sales. Restaurant level margins for the quarter were 19.5%, an improvement of 180 basis points from last year. And earnings per share increased 33% to $2.13. The Q1 comp of 2.2% is comprised of an underlying comp sales growth for the quarter of 2.7%, and that's before the 50 basis point impact from Chiptopia as we've lapped deferred revenue from Chiptopia in Q1 of last year. Comp sales were driven by higher average check, primarily from the price increase taken since Q1 of last year. The price increases averaged about 5% across the menu and resistance has been less than 20%. The check average also benefited from customers adding queso to their order which added about 200 basis points. April trends have been impacted by unseasonably cold and wintery weather in much of the country as well as the Easter shift, but taking these impacts into account, underlying April comp transaction trends are similar to Q1. Now keep in mind that we started lapping the first price increase from last year on April 15, which accounted for about 1% of the sales comp. Based on comp trends through the first quarter, we are reiterating our full year comp sales guidance in the low single digits with lower sales comps expected in the first half the year due to tougher comparisons. Now this guidance does not include any projected impact from the sales growth strategies we're currently developing, as it is too early to determine the timing and magnitude of the impact these strategies may have on the comp. We opened 35 new restaurants in the quarter and continue to expect 130 to 150 new openings for the full year. We're in the early stages of building our pipeline for 2019, and while it's too early to provide specific opening range for 2019, we expect to open at or above the 2018 opening level. We're pleased with the strong performance of our new restaurants this year, and we'll continue to emphasize high quality, high returning new restaurants as we build out the pipeline. Food costs during the quarter were 32.4%, and that was down 140 basis points from the 33.8% last year, and that's down from 34.2% in Q4. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase and efficiencies in paper and packaging. We expect relatively stable prices for the rest of 2018 across most items, resulting in food cost at or below the 33% range for the full year. Now this full year estimate is higher than the Q1 due to the seasonal shift to source avocados from California which will start in Q2. Labor costs for the quarter were 27.8%, 90 basis points higher than last year. Wage inflation of 5% was offset by the price increase but deleverage from negative transactions along with the Chiptopia revenue deferral drove the higher labor as a percent of sales. We expect labor costs to improve in the low to mid 27% range in Q2 as we move into our seasonally higher sales months. And we expect labor for the full year to approach 28% as crew and manager merit increases combined with general wage pressures continue to outpace the comp. Occupancy costs for the quarter were 7.4% or flat with last year, and we expect full year to be in a similar range. Other operating costs were 12.9% of sales, down from 14.1% last year. Our marketing and promo costs were only 1.8% in the quarter which is a decrease of about 150 basis points compared to last year. We still anticipate marketing and promo costs to be right around 3% of sales for the full year with elevated spending for the remainder of the year. And while Chris and the marketing team are still working on their plan for Q2 and the rest of the year, we would expect marketing and promo will be in the 3.5% to 4% range in Q2. Other operating costs included about 30 basis points of incremental maintenance and repair costs that we discussed on the last call. And we expect M&R to continue at this elevated level during 2018. G&A for the quarter was $77 million, or 6.7% of sales, an increase from 6.5% last year. This was lower than expected due to stock comp forfeitures of around $4 million and the 2018 equity grant that was done very late in the quarter. With normalized stock comp in Q2, total G&A is expected to be around $7 million higher, around $84 million, and that run rate puts us on target to hit the $330 million G&A for the full year, which was communicated last quarter. Underlying G&A in the quarter increased $8 million compared to last year to support our growth as well as several initiatives including new formalized training programs and operational changes in the field. This increase comes after three years of flat G&A despite opening up 650 restaurants. As we fully develop our strategic plan to strengthen our unit economic and drive sustainable sales growth, we may need to adjust how and where we invest our G&A. As such these G&A estimates for the second quarter and the full year are subject to change and we'll update you on any known changes during the special investor call Brian mentioned earlier. Depreciation was 4.1% of sales for the quarter, an increase from 3.7% last year. We expect depreciation to remain at about 4% for several quarters as we accelerate the depreciation for items expected to be replaced related to the maintenance and repair refresh, as well as other capital initiatives that we described on the last call. Our pre-tax income was $94.2 million, and our effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.9%. I'd like to spend a few more minutes than I normally would on this tax rate to put it in the right context. First of all, the actual tax rate we expect to pay the government is around 28.8%, not 36.9%. This tax rate of 36.9% includes about 810 basis points, the bulk of which are non-economic accounting items related to stock-compensation issues in previous years. In essence, during the quarter we wrote off deferred tax assets related to previously issued stock-comp because the related performance shares either did not vest, and so they expired, or the shares vested at a much lower value. So, the related deferred tax asset on our balance sheet needed to be written off or written down and the write-off flows through the tax expense line. We expect no such write-off in Q2 and Q3, so our effective tax rate is expected to be around 28.8% in those quarters. During the fourth quarter, additional performance shares may expire, and if they do, we'll write-off the related deferred tax assets for those awards. Again, we'll not actually pay a higher tax rate, but the write-off will flow through the tax line. We expect the tax rate including this write-off in Q4 will be around 38.4%. Before I leave the discussion on taxes I want to briefly walk through the components of our underlying tax rate. There are five key components that roll up to the underlying rate. First, our federal tax rate is the statutory 21%. Second, our state tax rate is about 5.6% and it's higher than last year's rate because of the lower federal rate. That takes our rate to 26.6%. Third, we lost part of the deduction for free meals we give to our restaurant teams which adds 1.3% to the rate. That takes us to 27.9%. Fourth, about 1.6% is added related to the tax law change, where all named executive officer compensation over $1 million is not deductible. And fifth, our rate is reduced by about 60 basis points for employer wage credits and other miscellaneous items. And that gets us to the 28.8% I mentioned earlier. For the full year, taking into account \u2013 taking all this into account and adding about 4% on an annual basis for the non-economic write-off of deferred tax items I talked about earlier, we estimate that the 2018 effective full-year tax rate will be around 33%. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, ending the quarter with $580 million in cash and investments, and we generated $200 million in cash from operations. During the first quarter, we repurchased $68 million of our stock at an average price of $311 per share and we spent $58 million on capital investments outlined on the previous call. We still expect opportunistically to repurchase shares throughout the year, invest in the capital items we discussed on the last call, and maintain a cash and investments balance of about $500 million. As I mentioned on the last earnings call, the overall guidance we provided then and we're reiterating today, does not factor in any potential strategic changes arising from hiring a new CEO. As Brian mentioned earlier, we will need to realign the organization in order to support and execute our updated strategy. We also plan to carefully analyze underperforming assets during the second quarter. This organizational review and the asset review will likely entail some one-time costs in 2018 that are too early to quantify, but these initiatives are intended to support and strengthen our economic model and set us up to execute our strategic plan and deliver long-term shareholder value. We'll share more details with you later this quarter. We're encouraged by our first quarter results and we're optimistic about the direction we're headed. We're confident that the changes we're making to our leadership and the realignment of our organization will enable us to be more nimble and more innovative in all areas : customer access, digital, menu, and the restaurant environment, and will allow us to execute better to deliver on our commitments to our guests, our employees, and our shareholders. We look forward to sharing more details about our plans on our special investor call which will be scheduled some time before our Q2 earnings call. Operator, we'll now open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. Nicole M. Miller-Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you, good afternoon. Jack, a quick one for you. Did you reiterate CapEx? We were going pretty quick through the numbers, so I just wanted to check that. I wanted to check that real quick, and then ask Brian a quick question. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, Nicole, the CapEx right now we expect will be about the same as we outlined on the last call. It's going to be in the neighborhood of $300 million. About one-third of that is new stores. The other two-thirds is existing stores. The big items there is the refresh that we talked about, which is about $50 million. Another big piece was about $45 million for the digitized second make-line, and then there's another \u2013 a number of other things that we outlined on the last call, but those are still intact now. Nicole, just like I mentioned, our guidance hasn't taken into account the impact of strategies. It's possible that we may refine that or adjust that throughout the year, and we'll give you a full recap on any changes when we talk to you before the next earnings call. Nicole M. Miller-Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great, thank you. And then, Brian, just a big picture question for you, and thanks for your time. Do you see this as a recovery story or global growth opportunity, just curious how you see this playing out long-term? And you talked about five pieces you want to execute, could you give us any little detail before the next call on maybe some of the low-hanging fruit versus longer-term solutions? Thank you. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, sure, Nicole. First, I think the opportunity is clearly a recovery story in the U.S. and we'll be focused on taking what I believe is a powerful brand that has really strong economics, strong purpose, that when we tie the elements that I outlined in my earlier comments, and we'll go into much further detail on our special call, I think the opportunity is really exciting for what this brand has in front of it. The innovation will be across the business, as I mentioned, in access, digital, menu, and frankly, we'll double-down on our fundamentals. So, I think it's a story of recovery, and then where that recovery takes us I think is also really exciting, but that's much longer-term discussion. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird & Co. Please proceed with your question. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi, good afternoon. Brian, just a couple of questions kind of high level how you're thinking about how this plays out over the next few years. Are you thinking, I guess, directionally that you're going to need to make a lot of investments in the business? I know you talked about realigning the structure, but do you think there's going to be a big step up in expenses related to that? And then secondly, I know Jack mentioned next year you'd open a similar number of units, or maybe a little higher, but how are you thinking about unit growth as you execute this turnaround strategy? Do you think you need to slow or moderate the unit growth in the out-years to accomplish what you're envisioning? Thanks. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah. Okay, thanks, David. Your first question, I think, we can get into all the details of how we see the plan playing out forward. I think some of the good news is, though, as I've looked into the business, like a great area of focus the people have been asking about is our marketing spend. And I think the marketing spend is one of those areas that we believe there's a lot of opportunity to take those dollars that we're currently allocating and make the brand much more visible with what we have. And then we're going to put in place more of a test-and-learn approach on the initiatives that will roll out, so, we'll have clarity on what we believe the return is for the investment that we're making before we make those decisions to go beyond our current plans. So, I think the recovery plan that we'll be putting in place, or as I talked about earlier, our path to performance will be based on leveraging the idea of testing, improving out propositions, while at the same token with our organization we build capability and we restructure to support the strategy that I believe will set us up for growth in the near term and longer term. Your second question regarding units, the good news is the economics of the units that we're opening continue to look very strong, and as mentioned in the script, we see no reason for us to change the pace that we are experiencing this year, and obviously, as we get further into our plan, we'll give the appropriate updates as the time permits when it's right to do that. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Alliance Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you and congratulations, Brian, on the new role. I wanted to ask two, if I may. One is about the quarter that just passed, and then sort of going forward. So, in terms of the quarter that just passed, I guess I was surprised at what appears to be a fairly quick impact you might have be having, a couple of things that we've seen are maybe new creative around marketing and then a waste management initiative that looks like it has some pretty big opportunities in terms of \u2013 in restaurant waste management. So, I guess, from my perspective to what extent is this you, Brian, kind of putting your stamp already on that and do you see a lot of low-hanging fruit like what some of these initiatives seem to suggest, just in terms of sort of basic systematic approaches? So that was question one. And then question two, if you could just talk a little bit about what you meant by consumer meaningful innovation across the business in the context of what's always been a very simple, straightforward menu and the operations that go with that? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, sure. So first, obviously thank you for the kind words. Very excited to be in the CEO role at Chipotle. It's loaded with opportunity, which I think is what you're asking about. And what I'll tell you is in the short-term, I think, there are real opportunities for us to make simple pivots to increase, I think, the appeal of our brands to those customers that are already very much big fans. One of the big surprises for me, frankly, even once it got announced that I was taking this role, was the amount of people that reached out just saying how much they love Chipotle and they love the food. And I think just with the most recent advertising we made a little pivot towards reminding people what is great about the ingredients. This Food With Integrity purpose really resonates and reminding people why they feel good about eating Chipotle, I think, is always a good approach. So, you'll continue to see us make simple pivots like that while we also continue to push this brand forward in a big way from the standpoint of access, as it relates to digital innovation; menu, as it relates to menu innovation that leverages our operating model, which I believe is something very special in this industry and allows us to do a lot of exciting things, whether it's day parts or simple menu tweaks that I think will broaden the appeal. And then obviously on \u2013 I think, you were kind of mentioning your question about waste management and such. Look, there's always opportunities to be better on the cost side and we're going to continue to look for those opportunities along the way. Because that just frees up the ability to give the customer more of what they want and our team members a better experience to provide the experience we want them to provide. So, lots of opportunities I think in the short-term. We're going to be very cognizant of what are the things we pace in sequence in the near term and what are the things we put in to test to ensure we're focusing on the right things over the next 18 to 24 months. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yeah, that's very, very helpful. Thank you. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please proceed with your question. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, good afternoon. Jack, a quick question on the restaurant level margin. I know you've beat by a good amount in the first quarter. I think, some of that as you mentioned with marketing will catch up as the year goes on. Are you still looking for 17.5% to 18.5% for the year? And then longer term, I guess, with \u2013 Brian, with your leadership, I mean, how do you think about the long-term restaurant level margin at Chipotle as you talk about new day parts balancing sales versus margin? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, Sharon. On the margin range, listen, we had a very nice quarter. It was aided by lower marketing \u2013 and the good news is Brian and Chris to the extent they came in and were able to look at what marketing was doing, they were able to redirect dollars, so they weren't spent. And so that's kind of dry powder. So that's dry powder that we have for future quarters. I think that's a very good thing. I would say the range of 17.5% to 18.5% now appears quite conservative. I don't know that I would change it. I think what I would do is say we're going to probably hit for the year at the high end that. Could we beat it slightly? Sure. I just wouldn't want to call it a victory just yet but getting out of the gates this strong does show that we have some great margin potential. And then you wanted to know in terms of margin potential going forward. If you want general margin potential, Sharon, I can answer that. I still think that our margins are going to be highly contingent around volume. Like, for example, if we're in this 18.5% to 19% or so for this year, if we get up to $2.2 million volume, we could do a 22% margin. If we get to a $2.4 million volume, we could do a 24% margin. So, really the biggest lever to pull is bringing more customers in. If we bring more customers in we know that our model levers up pretty significantly. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much and, Brian, good to hear your voice again. Congratulations. Two questions. One is when you look at the brand and you've looked at it from afar and now you're looking at it from the inside, how do you think about the price value relationship in this business versus the one you came from? Is there an opportunity for example to broaden the price value relationship so you can capture more customers? Are you happy with kind of the price value? So, think about just how you think about that price value equation for the brand going forward. And maybe just secondly, in your mind, what's the right timeframe for us to look at your initiatives that you're contemplating and how they're going to play out? In other words, is this a year of investment and the impact is really felt in 2019 or do you think there can be some meaningful impact and changes inside of 2018? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, well, thanks and good to hear your voice as well. Look, here's what I would tell you is, the value proposition at Chipotle is tremendously strong. And now with that said, we will always be looking for innovation that continues to enhance that value proposition. The most important thing I think you can do for a healthy value proposition is to never get complacent on where you stand. So, we will be on the side of the consumer making sure that we give them the value proposition that excites them to come back over and over again. So, all the initiatives we'll be talking about, one of the ways that you make sure it's consumer relevant is it rings the bell for our customer on that value proposition. Whether that value proposition takes place in mobile, digital, loyalty, menu, access, those are all important things. So that's the one piece. You're second question about timeline. Look, here's what I would tell you is as opportunities present themselves, we will walk through those opportunities to grow the business. As we find opportunities that yield even bigger benefits through testing and learning and iterating, those things will probably take a little bit longer. But I think there are simple wins on our way to our path to what I think is going to be really accelerated opportunities in the future. So that's how I think about it. It's really a combination of both. We'll find some singles on our ways to finding home runs. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks for taking the question. So, obviously looking forward to the call that we're going to get in a month or two months with some more detail on this, but thinking about that call, is that something that's really going to be focused on where are the opportunities at the margin level, or to drive sales? Or should we be also thinking about there's going to be discussion of any sort of more structural changes, whether that's the balance sheet, is refranchising something that you're considering? How should we think about kind of what's on the table, or topics for discussion there? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, what I would tell you is we're going to use that special call as the opportunity to give clarity even further into the strategy, the structure necessary to execute that strategy, and what those key focus areas are to put Chipotle on the path to performance that we believe is highly attainable. So, it will be comprehensive. And I think, you'll find it will be choiceful. And I think, there's power in simplicity, power in choice and power in a focused organization. So obviously it will be a comprehensive discussion and the good news is we'll have our entire leadership team present to be able to really discuss our path forward. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thank you. And congratulations again, Brian. Two things. One just on the comp recovery maybe from an outsider or actually most recently a competitor's perspective, I'm just wondering in your view what do you think's been the greatest impediment to the Chipotle recovery over the past couple of years? Hence, I guess, which of these initiatives you're talking about will be the most impactful I guess is a different way to look at it. And then the second question was just on the fact that you came from Taco Bell, which obviously there's lots of laterals, but the one thing that's quite different is Taco Bell being close to 100% franchise model, now you're in a 100% company operated model. Just wondering qualitatively how do you \u2013 how does the approach differ, whether you look at it as just pros and cons to the franchising versus the company operated side. I'm just wondering as you now come into your new role, how you have to think about things differently in that perspective? Thank you. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, sure. So, look, I think to answer your first question, Chipotle, smartly, under Scott Boatwright's leadership has refocused the fundamentals in running these restaurants. We put clarity into roles. We've put focus on throughput and we've also put high expectations on the guest experience and the food experience we're going to provide. Those fundamentals are critical whether you own the restaurants or whether you franchise them to people. So there really is no tradeoff in what are the fundamentals to having a great restaurant? The other thing that I think Scott's done very well is he's put in a culture of accountability and a culture where people know they can count on each other to train, support and grow. And I think that is a foundational element for any upside that we will experience in this business. We can never lose sight on running great restaurants and having great people that lead those restaurants and supporting them with a wonderful culture and tremendous opportunities. So that's the first piece. The second piece is I think the brand has been invisible. So, I think, if you combine great fundamentals in the restaurant with now a visible brand that has a powerful purpose and really craveable food, it's a recipe for a lot of opportunity that can play well in the ways that customers want to eat food today, and I believe how they want to eat food in the future. So, I'm tremendously excited about the fundamentals that we are maniacally focused on, coupled with identifying how we make this brand much more visible and get a narrative back out there in explaining what makes our brand different, what makes our brand connect with people, feel good about the way they eat and live, and why they can feel great about carrying the badge of Chipotle with them. Oh, and I think, you had a question on franchising. You know, we see no need to go down that path right now, given the economic model that we have and the returns that we get with building new restaurants. So \u2013 but thanks for the question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bitner from Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed with your question. Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you and, of course, congratulations, Brian, as well from me. I have two questions for you guys, both on just how you're thinking about the asset base. Jack, you talked about an asset base review. First of all, is there an initial smell test you are doing on the unit economic threshold required to earn the right to stay in the asset base that you can talk to us about? And then, Brian, you talked about looking at your unit base and improving the accessibility of it. Could the implementation of drive-thrus play a role in the accessibility strategy where it makes sense or is accessibility really just focused solely on digital? And I ask that question just in the spirit of where you came from, obviously seeing the benefits of drive-thrus. Thanks. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, Brian, I'll address the first question on the asset base. No, we haven't changed our threshold for what is a high-returning asset. What we're looking at, though, is we had a number of restaurants that, before the drop in sales, were strong cash flow, strong returning stores. We opened a number of restaurants during a tough period where they got off to a slow start. So, our asset review is going to look at all the restaurants that are clear underperformers, and these would be negative cash flow stores. So, we're not looking at stores that are positive cash flow that the return is a little underperforming. We're going to look at stores that \u2013 restaurants are not cash flowing, that maybe we picked the wrong site, maybe they got off to a wrong start and made a bad first impression, and it's going to be difficult if not impossible to change that. And to you give you an order of magnitude, the review, while we're still in the middle of it, we're looking at something less than 100 restaurants. So, it's not a huge list of restaurants, but that's kind of the total population that we're looking at. We'll review each and every one of them and we'll look at the whole story from a financial standpoint, from a real estate standpoint, from a what kind of first impression did we make, and then we'll make some very careful choices about what to do with the assets. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, hey, Brian, this is Brian. So, your second question regard to access. You know, look, I think innovation and access, obviously you are not surprised by the idea that look, digital is a key piece of the puzzle, right? Whether it's through the mobile access, delivery as access, also kiosks as access, catering as access. I mean I love the list that I'm rattling off here. The trick for us is figuring out what comes first and how we prioritize it accordingly. Now, drive-thrus I think are an interesting proposition for Chipotle as an element. It'll be something that will definitely be a part of our access innovation program, but that's in the scheme of what's going to happen in the very near-term versus what's more of a longer-term access innovation play. Drive-thru would fall further on that longer-term scale. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC : Hi. My first question is on the \u2013 for Jack, versus what you guided in February on the restaurant margins, it came in about 3 to 3.5 points better than expected, and we can see what is going to happen over the course of the year with COGS and labor expense, but a lot of that came from other operating expenses in this quarter, and I know that 150 bps was related to the ad spend shift, so, I'm curious what else in that line item would look better over the course of the year? Is that just not doing the maintenance or is there something else that's just looking better than you anticipated in that line item? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Well, yeah, thanks, Matt. The food costs behaved really well. Avocados were something that took a bite out of our margins last year. They got better late in the fourth quarter and then they got better again. And you hear us talk about avocados kind of almost every year. It has a big impact when it goes up and down. Nearly 50% of our transactions include guacamole. And so, when prices shoot up, which by the way, they shot up from something below $30 a case to nearly $80 a case for part of the fourth quarter. So, they've come back to kind of normal prices. If they stay at normal prices, we should have a decent food cost during the year. Labor is kind of the same story in terms of wage inflation continues. We expect it to continue, and so, the guidance I gave you, I think, is very reasonable guidance. So, I think, we got off to a great start. I think the comments that Brian made about Scott and the field, our field teams did a great job of managing food costs to the extent that it was their job to order the right amount of food, to control food waste, things like that. They did great job. They've done a great job managing labor, as well. So, I think we're off to a great start. I think if we keep these kind of controls, the next big surprise or additive thing would be additional sales. And so, some of the things that Brian mentioned go into test and they test well, and if we put those into more restaurants and we get more sales, we know we have the ability to leverage our margins when we bring more customers in. And that would be the next thing to look for. Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC : Got it. So, Brian, I've heard a lot really from external people that when you look at the supply chain that Chipotle has versus other restaurant chains that just the way that food is prepped and the way that it flows through that supply chain, it always makes it harder to innovate at Chipotle versus other chains. Having been at other restaurant chains, do you feel that there's a big factor that sort of limits your innovation at that company? Or do you see it's kind of just green fields and there's a lot that you can do? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, thanks for the question. Look, I actually think the -- I'll break up your comment. I guess supply chain meaning the ingredients that we use. I see no barrier to innovation. If anything, I see this great ingredients to be able to further distance ourselves from other restaurant alternatives. And then from the standpoint of then finishing that ingredient in the restaurant, it is a really powerful model. I mean if there's one thing that I've been really impressed by is the throughput capability of this line is something really special and unique. And I actually think it's an advantage to figure out how to do innovation that can build from a throughput machine. I don't think there are many places where you could say, well, I can have that great food, done at that speed, and then we can innovate on that foundation or that platform? And you'll see when we're talking about some of the innovation we're talking about. It just takes advantage of what I believe is a competitive advantage. So, I think, we're going to be able to innovate and distance ourselves and really put ourselves into what I believe is something very special that will delight customers and give our team members the ability to execute flawlessly. Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC : Great, thank you. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andy Barish from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC : Yeah, I was wondering on that \u2013 actually follow-up on a couple of those comments. If there is some throughput data you're willing to share kind of currently versus a year ago? And then secondly on innovation, not only supply chain, but just the physical plant and now the need for second make-lines. Is the space constraints make it more difficult to innovate or is that sort of an outmoded thought and there's ways to work around that with your fresh eyes viewing the business now? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, thanks for the question. Because the second make-line is actually a huge enabler for our business to take throughput to the next level, frankly. And the reason is we've put digital capability into 250 plus restaurants, but the fact that we already have the second make-line physically there in all our restaurants is a huge opportunity for us to both innovate as well as drive throughput even further on our consumer-facing line as well as our second make-line. That second make-line has some efficiencies that we are delighted that we have in place because as we dial up the innovation in digital and we dial up that off-premise access, it presents a great opportunity for us to really enhance our throughput on both lines. Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. And then any throughput numbers you're willing to share or is it a little early for that? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Look, we can probably get into those details. Scott will be available as part of the special call we're going to do and we're happy to take you through that then. Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, hi, thank you. Hi, Brian. At Taco Bell, you guys put in both fourth meal, or the so-called late-night day part, as well as breakfast. And we've mentioned day part a couple of different times and I was wondering what that could potentially mean at Chipotle, whether it's different products at different times of the day which can happen certainly within a quick service or a fast-casual type of format, and whether it's possible to have breakfast without a drive-thru or maybe you can put breakfast in just the dense urban stores, while not necessarily putting them in suburban stores. Just thinking about what kind of potential you think day parts really means for the brand at this point. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, sure. So, look, I think one of the things that's really exciting about the day part opportunity for Chipotle is today we're opening at 10 :30, 10:45 and we're closing roughly around 10 :00 PM, and there's opportunities to expand those hours and leverage our existing food and our existing platform in a very seamless fashion. Then when you look at the obvious day parts within those extended hours and you quickly see where there's opportunity where we have some down time where, frankly, I think with some marketing and some product innovation we could turn those down times into transaction-driving times. So, as I think about it right now, there is day part expansion opportunity with our current model and then you layer on some menu innovation coupled with some marketing communication, I see a real ability to drive the existing platform in those day parts without having to take the step today all the way through breakfast and introducing a whole new food platform. So, that's where our thinking is today. Not to say that in the future you may want to even expand those hours further and you need to think about new food platforms, but that's not in the plan right now. John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Hey, Brian. First a question on consumer scores. You mentioned something about becoming more consumer-centric. What is the consumer telling you about Chipotle today and the opportunities to improve, perhaps in ways that you've seen the brand deteriorated in those scores, and just in ways that you just feel like it's underachieving? And then separately, just building on that last thing that you mentioned, the operating model, everyone's always assumed that Chipotle's operating model, because they have those limited number of wells in front of us, doesn't have the ability to handle new menu news or even use price because of that simple menu. And those are two tools that you used with great effect in the past, and so, I think people are having a hard time understanding how you're going to use those going forward. So, that comment would be helpful, as well. Thanks. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Sure. So, on your first question regarding the consumer. You know, what we see is a real opportunity to make the brand more visible and be more top of mind with people to remind them why they love Chipotle. When you remind people about the fact that they buy into this idea of Food With Integrity, cultivating a better world, they instantly feel better about the food they're eating. And we make good on that promise. So, I think there's a real opportunity to be much more visible on why you want to be connected to this brand, why do you believe in this brand. And based on the information I'm seeing, that resonates with how people want to eat today and how they will want to eat in the future. Look, there's also huge opportunities to get people access \u2013 one of their biggest complaints, frankly, is access to the brand. The brand is not that convenient. I know we have 2,400 stores, almost 2,500 stores, we, as a result, are not that convenient to people. So, you've got people saying, hey, when can I do mobile ordering? When can I do delivery? When can I get Chipotle to me? And the good news is more than I think 50% of the people don't even realize that we started to do these things. So, there is tremendous opportunity of educating people on why they should feel good about the brand, why they will love the food, why it's craveable, because it gives them all of the customization, the abundance that they're looking for with the ingredients that they want. And then you combine that with now giving them more access and getting food to them on their terms, it's a really exciting proposition. Your second question on our ability to innovate. The line has flexibility, so long as we first test and understand the demand that we're generating. If we prepare ourselves for what is going to happen, Scott and his operators will be capable to use our supply chain and our operating model to execute and meet consumers' expectations. Where you run into problems is when you get ahead of a forecast, and one of the things we're going to put in place here is when we are working on innovation, we're going to pilot that innovation so that we can have a prediction of what's going to happen and prepare the operating model accordingly to support it. So, I'm very optimistic about opportunities that just leverage getting more access to what Chipotle is today, and then you add some innovation and I think you broaden the appeal and we have predictability of what that's going to perform, Scott and the operators will be able to execute. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. I have two questions. The first for Brian. Have you looked at portion sizing and your thoughts on whether or not consumers are paying you for your portion sizes now, if there's an opportunity to take that either up or down? And then I think you had also talked about employee turnover coming down recently. Any metrics around that and what do you think is driving that? Have you made any changes on the training front or -- the industry has been going up, and so that would be kind of impressive? I guess, I'm wondering what you guys are doing differently? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Sure. So, the piece on employee turnover, I think that's a testament to Scott putting clarity of what you're supposed to be doing in your role, how you support each other in the restaurant, and then providing clarity of how you can grow in this organization. And people like to stay at places where they believe they're appreciated and they have the opportunity to grow, and that's the culture that we're putting into the restaurants and I think that's why you're seeing our turnover move down. And it's really exciting because the more we can push that turnover down, the more we don't find ourselves retraining the organization and we execute better. It's that simple. So, Marissa, who's new to the team, she's going to be laser-focused on how we drive this culture and training all the way through the restaurant while Scott partners with her to take from a culture of accountability to also a culture of growth. And I think you put those two things together, people will feel highly appreciated and believe that there's a future for them at Chipotle. What was your first question? Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : The first question was just on portion sizing. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Oh, portion sizing. Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Okay. Yeah. So, look, one of the things clearly that people love about Chipotle is the customization proposition and we're going to continue to figure out how we get more consistent in our execution for people, so that they don't feel like they got too much this time, or they got too little. But one of the things that I love about the experience, and the consumer knows, is we're a place that wants to get them the experience that they're after with their food. And that's not going to change. So, if people want a little more, we'll probably give them a little more. If they want a little less, we'll give them a little less. But regardless whether they're asking for a little more or a little less, one thing Scott is focused on is how do we continue to get more consistent, so people feel like they're getting the experience they got the last time as well then the experience they can count on for the next time. So, that's what we're focused on, is how do we get more consistent with that experience, but we're never going to tell the consumer you can't ask us for a little more or a little less. Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Understood. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great, thank you, and just to echo, Brian, congrats again on the new role. Longer term question for Brian and a short-term one for Jack. So, Brian, as you think about the road ahead, can you help us compare and contrast the starting points? When you look at Taco Bell in 2011 and Chipotle in 2017, what do you think are the different factors at play here that help shape the turnaround, if you will? And then, Jack, you mentioned, as well, the similar comp trends that continued in April. How are you framing that? Just is that looking at it on a geometric three year or how should we think about that? Perhaps just for simplicity, if you just disclose the number, it might be helpful. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: So, why don't I go first, then I'll hand it over to you, Jack. So, look, here's what I believe for Chipotle. I believe the brand has been invisible and I think as the brand becomes visible and we lead culture, that's going to be a huge opportunity going forward. This brand needs to be leading culture, not reacting to it, and the people that are loyal to this brand, that's what they want to be a part of. The other piece that is very exciting about this company is, look, there is limited innovation happening in small scale and the opportunity for us is how do we take some of that innovation to pilot it and get it to a place where we can now do it at scale. And the opportunities, we talked about a few of them, right? They go from access to digital, to menu, to even the restaurant design opportunities going forward. That is huge opportunity. A brand that has a lot of relevance, that's culturally right in leading, coupled with innovation, built on strong fundamentals that give people great food at a fast experience at a great value. I like the future. I really get excited about that because those are things that I think as we put together this leadership team here with Chris and Scott and Marissa and Jack and Curt and Lori, it is mission one to make this brand visible, and right next to it is be culturally relevant so all the innovation and the fundamentals that we put in place are going to, I think, attract people not only to work here but attract people to continue to be our loyal customers. And that's why I'm excited about the long-term. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: And, Andrew, in terms of what I looked at when I made the comments about April, we look at dollar trends, we looked at what our expectations were, based on what we expected with the Easter shift, what normal seasonality would bring. The weather definitely hit us during parts of the month. I'm sure that's not a surprise to you. From a comp standpoint, we looked at it mainly from a one-year comp standpoint. If you're going to do multiple years, you'd have to go back to three. A two-year trend will not give you anything meaningful. 2016 and 2017 lined up, 2016 was a step down, 2017 was a step up. So, if you wanted to do a three-year layer, you'll probably get in the same ballpark, but for purposes of what we did, we just kept it very, very simple, looked at April compared to where our previous trends were. And underneath it all, it looks like the trends were very similar when you factor weather out. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Will Slabaugh from Stephens, Inc. Please proceed with your question. Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah, thanks, guys. On the 5% pricing, and then maybe more specifically on longer-term pricing plans in general, I realize it's been a while since Chipotle has taken any meaningful pricing, but 5% is obviously a decent ways ahead of where the rest of the industry is. So, I'm curious, number one, if you plan to change the strategy to be more consistent in terms of low price increases, and number two, if you've seen any material difference in customer pushback to the pricing in some of the market that we've talked about as being lower performing markets in recent years, or if that 20% level that you talked about earlier has been fairly consistent. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, the every three-year pricing, we've done it kind of three times in a row now. It's not necessarily strategy that we say, okay, no more price increases for the next three years. It just kind of happened this past time. We didn't want to do it while we were trying to bring customers back into the restaurant. Before that, labor inflation was very tame, and so we had strong comps and so we could lever our margin without resorting to pricing. It's a powerful advantage to have if you can continue to build your model, continue to expand leverage without constantly increasing menu prices. And so, we took advantage of that luxury. Going forward, we're going to do what we need to do. And if that means doing smaller, more regular price increases, we're certainly open to that. If we can lever our model, if we get the top-line going and we lever the model without a price increase, we think we can drive greater value to the customer. Customers always love it when they get greater value. So, we're not going to predetermine what and when we will do anything with pricing, but we're open to doing something other than kind of a three-year cadence. And in terms of the resistance, we just don't see much resistance across the company. The only time we've seen it, and we've seen it in the past, as well. We see it a bit on the West Coast, and that's it. Otherwise, for the rest of the company, our customers think we provide a great value. And value is not just based on price. It's based on high-quality ingredients, it's based on a lot of food, it's based on an environment that they enjoy, and it's actually the value that we bring is a harder thing to bring, based on food, based on environment, based on the overall experience. Price is something that our consumers, sure, would they like to pay less? (1:02:27) Who wouldn't? But when they come to Chipotle and they get a great experience in a nice restaurant, the food is delicious, they call that a great value. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull from Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Chris O'Cull - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Oh, thanks, good afternoon. First, Jack, I apologize if I missed it, but what was the traffic decline in the quarter? And then secondly, Brian, several of the opportunities you mentioned to improve access for the brand seem to me, could take some time to build, but are there opportunities to quickly address the traffic declines you're seeing? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, I'll answer on the traffic. The comp came from an increase in average check, and you can take the 5% price increase, it's less than 20%, which is rounded up to 20%. That added 4%. Queso added 2%. So, you can back into what the transaction impact was. So, you'd be in the 3.3% or so range, 3.3%, 3.5%, something like that, and so that's the underlying traffic. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, and then to answer your question on what's my belief on the transaction opportunity going forward. Look, I think that's a real opportunity, and one of the things that Chris and the marketing organization are going to be centered on. And the good news is I believe the combination of the brand visibility, the innovation that I talked about, I think, there are opportunities in the near term that we can start putting into place and put into action that make it a material impact on our transactions. And then over time, you'll see the culmination of all these things coming together. I think, play an even bigger impact on the transactions and the number of people coming into our restaurants. So, it's really a combination of the digital, the menu, the access, programs like loyalty, those are all things that are going to be centered on making sure we are driving transactions as part of the proposition. Chris O'Cull - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Strelzik - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Over the last couple years, there's been a shifting focus at different points in time trying to bring back sales among existing customers at some points and finding new customers at some points. I'm just wondering, Brian, do you think about the opportunity set in that way, the customer base in that way? And if so, where do you see the greatest opportunities over the next 6, 12, 24 months? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, look. Here's what we know about our customers. Every age cohort loves Chipotle. Okay? And we over-index with young people. And this brand is a youthful spirit. It's a challenger, right? It's breaking convention of what accessible food done fast is. And that appeals broadly. So, our goal is not to be exclusive, our goal is to be inclusive, and our goal is to drive transactions with a youthful spirit, a meaningful positioning, and continue to leverage the strength of being a youthful brand that connects with youth. So, that's how I look at it. Obviously, Chris and I are digging deep into it because we need to understand the reasons why you either slowed down or increased your usage with us. And then we want to make sure we understand why all these different age cohorts are excited about being in the Chipotle business. Our goal is every category buyer to be coming to Chipotle. It's that simple. I probably won't get all of them in the near term, but I'm going to try in the long-term. Andrew Strelzik - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great, thank you very much. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brett Levy from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Brett Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, thank you. If you could share a little bit, Jack, this question is for you on the margins. You mentioned that you think you can get to the high end of the 17.5%, 18.5% range, and then you said you could possibly exceed it, but you also mentioned earlier that nothing is really being built into the plan with respect to what Brian's integration and his ideas can have. Can you just balance between what you were saying? Because it sounded like you said it's going to be without any implementation of Brian's strategies, but it also sounded like you were talking about some additional sales. Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, I think you heard it right. We reiterated our guidance that comps will be in the low-single digits, so the margin comments deal with that assumption. To the extent we have strategies, that goes through pilot and are worthy of a rollout, meaning we expect to get a return on our investment. That's not included in the comp. It's just too early to know what those things might be or what the magnitude might be, so this is kind of a base case, if you will. Brett Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, and, team, good luck. Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Brett. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session and I would like to turn the call back to Coralie for closing remarks. Coralie Witter - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our special call in late Q2. Thank you.

And now, I will turn the call over to Brian Niccol. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Coralie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report a solid second quarter with sales and restaurant level margins ahead of our expectations. Total sales grew 8.3% to $1.27 billion, driven by comparable sales of 3.3% and 34 new restaurants opened in the quarter. This positive comparable sales trajectory enabled us to expand restaurant level margins, which were up 90 basis points year-over-year to 19.7%. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual costs grew nearly 24% to $2.87 and our GAAP earnings were $1.68. While Jack will go through the financials in more detail shortly, I'd like to put these results into context by discussing how the work our 70,000 employees do every day contributed to these financial outcomes. Last month, we shared with you that we would execute our strategy to win today and cultivate the future by focusing on these five areas : becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience to create a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model and building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu and the restaurant experience. Today, I'll focus on how innovation in digital and access and how improving our operations contributed to this quarter's results. Let me begin with operations. We know that strong sales growth and margins are dependent on great operations, which is the hallmark of any healthy brand. This brand was founded on outstanding operations and real food. We're getting back to our roots. When we have the right people leading the right teams and when those teams are well trained and operating with confidence, they execute great guest experiences. It takes time to build a culture of accountability and I'm pleased that we're seeing some encouraging signs of progress in key areas; namely our restaurant AB scores, a measurement system we implemented 1.5 years ago to drive greater accountability is trending in the right direction. We are doing a better job staffing our restaurants to match sales volumes and we have lower year-over-year hourly turnover, which tells us we are making progress on training and building great teams. Additionally, we have seen a meaningful decline in guest complaints and with that our guest satisfaction scores have improved since we started measuring them last year. This tells us that we made progress and that our guests are noticing the difference. We know that when the food is delicious, the field of the restaurant is great and we removed the friction from the flow of the order process, no matter the channel we delight customers. While I'm encouraged by our progress, we still have a lot of work to do. We have an opportunity to improve through-put, consistent execution of great food and consistent delivery of a great atmosphere. I'll outline some of the initiatives underway to address those opportunities. We are halfway through our Big Fix initiative, which is designed to bring our restaurants back up to standards and make them uniquely Chipotle. This not only improves the guest experience as the appearance of our restaurants is clean and well-maintained for every guest, but the team member experience improves as well. We overhauled our training materials several months ago and have retrained three quarters of our field leaders through Cultivate University. That's an in-restaurant and in-classroom one week training session that we launched in April, that investment in the ongoing development of our field leadership continue to drive crew member engagement. We are supplementing that training with a new hospitality training program in the restaurants and we are in the early innings of refining our training to teach and taste the details, so that we achieve the winning combination of great food, feel and flow with every guest experience. We are zeroing in on how to get back to great through-put as speed of service is a foundational element of convenience that our guests truly value. Late last year, we rolled out what we call the owner's path, a comprehensive review of our restaurants performance, equipping our field leaders with these tools improving their powers of observation and allowing them to focus on the critical details of delivering improved guest experience. In addition, the tool creates teaching moments for their general managers and documents the corrective actions are taken when needed. We are currently rolling out a digital version for mobile phones and tablets of this previous paper-based tool, that should result in more consistent operations across our restaurants. We'll have this in place nationally by October. We're also in the process of redesigning our forecasting and labor scheduling tool. This is significant undertaking, but necessary for us to have accurate sales forecasting and deliver the right amount of labor at the right time to meet the needs of our guests. The new tool will have a best-in-class sales forecasting component that will leverage machine learning to remove the guesswork of determining sales and labor needs for our business. In addition, our team members will have the ability to see their schedules remotely and swap shifts from mobile phones, taking these tasks out of the hands of the manager. We believe leveraging technology such as this makes us a more desirable employer as we work to create a better experience for our crew members. We will continue to make investments in our restaurants because a better experience for our team members directly translates to a better experience for our guests. I'd also like to talk to you about the progress we are making around the innovation in digital and access, as this was a real bright spot in the quarter. Today, our annualized digital sales are approximately $0.5 billion, and we are in the early stages of this multi-billion dollar opportunity. Our digital sales grew 33% in the quarter and now account for 10.3% of sales, an acceleration from 20% growth in the first quarter. We now have 4 million active monthly users across our app and our website, a 65% increase since the end of last year. Delivery in group occasions were particularly strong this quarter. Delivery sales quadrupled in the quarter and we know from our customer research that improving access to Chipotle is an important growth lever, whether it be through adding more restaurants or enabling more convenience, like delivery. Today, delivery is available from 1,700 restaurants and we expect that to reach 2,000 restaurants by year-end. We're also pleased that delivery is now an option available directly from our app. Our group ordering business was solid in the seasonally strong quarter for catering orders. In mid-July, we expanded our Build-Your-Own catering offer nationally, whereby we lowered the minimum size and offered more price tiers for group orders, therefore expanding access for more occasions. We tested this enhancement earlier in the year and found that group order sales in our test stores outperformed the base by mid to high single digits. Delivery availability for catering expanded to two-thirds of our restaurants in the quarter. As I've mentioned, Chipotle's second make-line enables the business to handle the incremental growth without any impact on throughput or the in-restaurant experience. I'm happy to see progress on digitizing our second make-lines, which are now in roughly 500 restaurants. We are targeting approximately 1,000 restaurants to be enabled with the digital second make-line by year-end and we are accelerating our rollout to reach completion by the end of 2019. These digital second make-lines have a direct positive impact on the team member and guest experience. Also, the digital pickup shelf test in several New York City restaurants continues to show great promise and based on the results to-date, we will be expanding the test to a larger number of restaurants in several markets next month. We've mentioned before that we are undertaking a wide-ranging consumer research project, with the results available this fall. I did, however, want to mention a few interesting highlights that we've uncovered so far. Access is the number one lever we can pull to drive sales, which supports our new unit growth as well as the innovation focus around access via our digital channels. Additionally, we sit at an interesting intersection between fast food and fast casual, with many attributes such as value and speed that are typically associated with fast food and attributes such as quality and freshness, which are typically associated with fast casual. We're particularly strong with Millennial and Generation Z customers relative to most brands and when these groups try us, our odds of repeat visits are much higher. These early insights give us confidence that new news and the more engaging marketing that you're beginning to see will allow us to drive transaction growth. Also, I'm pleased with the speed at which we're getting transaction-driving initiatives across digital, access, loyalty and menu into test markets. The combination of these test markets and our early insights from our consumer research will inform our plans in 2019 and beyond. Before I turn it over to Jack, I want to thank all of our team members across the country that are working diligently to serve our guests real food, cooked to perfection and prepared in our restaurants with fresh ingredients just the way our guests like it. This hard work is the basis for all of our future success and we appreciate it tremendously. Now over to you, Jack. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Brian. I'm really pleased that our team is focused on our five strategic priorities, has contributed to a high quality quarter with comp sales of 3.3% and a 19.7% restaurant level margin. And underlying earnings were also strong after adjusting for a number of unusual costs during the quarter. As we discussed on our call last month, we'll continue to see costs over the next few quarters associated with our restructuring, relocation and underperforming store closures. These charges also have a temporary impact on our tax rate, which I'll talk about in more detail later. We generated revenue of $1.27 billion during the quarter, an increase of 8.3% from last year, on comp sales growth of 3.3%. That's on top of last year's strong 8.1% Q2 comp sales increase. Restaurant level margins of 19.7% expanded 90 basis points from last year and normalized earnings per share adjusted for the unusual items was $2.87. The second quarter had unusual expenses mostly related to the transformation and that negatively impacted EPS by about $1.19, leading to a GAAP earnings per share of $1.68. In Q2, we expensed about $25 million in expenses related to restaurant asset write-offs, approximately $16.5 million related to office closures and $7 million related to the restructure of our organization and other unusual expenses. These charges were offset by a non-recurring benefit of about $6.5 million related to lower stock comp expense as a result of the restructure. As a result of these transformation expenses, our tax rate increased about 400 basis points, which I'll explain later. The Q2 comp at 3.3% was primarily driven by higher average check due to the price increases taken over the last year as well as queso add-ons. The price increase average about 4% in the quarter and customer resistance to the price increase remains at or below 20%. The menu price impact was lower than Q1, as we lapped the first increase from April of last year in about 20% of the restaurants. Sales trends in the first three weeks of July continue to mirror what we saw in Q2 with the comp increasing over the last week or so, as we've begun to compare against those softer trends from last year. So overall, comps should improve from the 3.3% in Q2. However, keep in mind, that comparisons will get tougher later in Q3, as we lap the introduction of queso in early September, which initially added about 3.5% to the comp, before settling into a sustained benefit to the average check of about 2%. And in November, we will lap the price increase in about 1,000 restaurants, which added an additional 1.3% pro-rated impact to the comp. Based on second quarter results and expected improvement in the Q3 comp, we're increasing our full-year comp sales guidance from low single-digits to a low to mid single-digit comp range. We opened 34 new restaurants in the quarter and expect to be at the lower end of our 130 to 150 new opening guidance for the full-year. While we're still building inventory for next year's openings, we continue to expect 2019 openings will be at or above the 2018 levels. Our new restaurants this year have opened strong and we're continuing to emphasize high quality, high returning to restaurants as we build out our pipeline. As mentioned on our last call, we expect to close between 55 and 65 underperforming restaurants; and today, we're closing 29 Chipotle restaurants. During the second quarter, we closed five Pizzeria Locale in Kansas and Ohio and we also closed three Chipotle restaurants including one relocation. So, today's closures about half of the underperforming restaurants have now closed. Food comps for the quarter were 32.6%, a decrease of 150 basis points from the 34.1% in Q2 of last year. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase and more favorable avocado prices. The decreases were slightly offset by elevated prices for our steak and barbacoa. We expect food cost to increase to the low 33% range in Q3, due to the seasonal shift to source higher cost avocados from California and an uptick in paper and packaging costs. We expect to be closer to the 33% in Q4, as we begin to shift the supply of avocados back to Mexico. Labor costs for the quarter were 27%, an increase of 80 basis points from the 26.2% in Q2 of last year. The increase from last year was driven primarily from wage inflation of about 6% and increased restaurant manager bonus cost as we returned to normalized bonus payouts, rewarding our managers for delivering strong results. These increases were offset by leverage from the menu price increase. I expect labor cost to increase to the high 27% range in Q3 and to the mid 28% range in Q4 and these increase are driven primarily by seasonally lower sales in Q3 and Q4 and by general wage pressures. Occupancy cost for the quarter were 6.9%, which is flat with last year. Other operating costs for the quarter were 13.8%, a decrease of 20 basis points from Q2 of last year. Our marketing and promo cost were 3.2% in the quarter, a decrease of about 40 basis points compared to Q2 of last year. We expect marketing and promo cost to be at or slightly above 3% of sales for the full-year with elevated spending continuing in Q3 and Q4. Other operating cost continue to include about 30 basis points of higher maintenance and repair cost, which we first discussed on our Q4 call and we expect M&R to continue with this elevated level for the rest of the year. G&A in the quarter increased by $8 million compared to Q1 of this year. The increase compared to last quarter was primarily due to the stock comp forfeitures and the timing of the 2018 equity grant that we discussed on the last earnings call. As I mentioned earlier, G&A also included $7 million in charges related to the restructuring and additional unusual charges in the quarter, but those were offset by a $6.5 million non-recurring benefit related to revising our estimates of forfeitures, related to stock grants from employees expected to leave the company. G&A increase compared to Q2 of last year was primarily in support of our restaurant growth, digitizing our restaurant experience and operational leadership changes in the field. Depreciation expense for the quarter was 3.9%, an increase of 40 basis point from the 3.5% in Q2 of last year. This increase is due to the accelerated depreciation for items we're replacing were related to the maintenance and repair refresh as well as capital initiatives that we described on our Q4 call. We expect the increase related to the refresh to fall off in the second half of the year. However, it will be replaced by accelerated depreciation and restaurant closures we detailed earlier. As a result, we expect depreciation to remain at this elevated level for the rest of this year. Our pre-tax income was $70 million and our reported effective tax rate was 33.3%. Our tax rate was higher than the 29% underlying rate we discussed on our last earnings call and is a direct result of the $42 million in unusual expenses this quarter. Without these charges, our tax rate would have been right around at 28.5% effective rate and we expect to return to a roughly 29% rate next year when the transformation charges are fully behind us. This underlying rate of about 29% may be affected in future years by stock comp vesting and exercises when the benefit realized by our employees varies from our accounting treatment and we'll fully call out these impacts as they occur. We continue to expect the transformation cost on the restructuring, restaurant closures and other unusual cost will total between $115 million and $135 million with most of that amount hitting in 2018. We estimate that about $50 million to $55 million will hit in Q3 with most of the remainder in Q4. There will likely be some charges related to terminating restaurant and office leases that will spill into 2019. We'll also write-off about $10 million in deferred tax assets, beginning in Q4 with most hitting in 2019 as fully vested, but underwater options will likely expire as we complete the restructure of the organization. In Q3, we expect our effective tax rate to be right around 30.3%, or about 130 basis points higher than we guided last quarter. In Q4, we expect our tax rate to be as high as 43% or about 450 basis points higher than we guided last quarter. Both of these increases are due to a lower pre-tax income as a result of the transformation expenses. As mentioned during our Q1 call, our Q4 rate is impacted by performance shares that will likely expire in that period, because their performance shares will only vest if the stock price is over $700. We took deductions on these performance shares over the years, but if they prove worthless, we won't get a tax benefit contributing to the estimated 43% tax rate. We'll continue to provide more specifics on future transformation-related costs, when we have more certainty around the timing and we will continue to break out the unusual costs for normal cost you can follow the underlying trends. We're encouraged by our second quarter results and the contributions of our restaurant teams have delivered an excellent guest experience. We're also encouraged by our guest response to our digital initiative so far along with the solid sales and restaurant-level margin performance during the quarter. We're confident that significant changes we're making to our organization will enable us to continue to improve operational excellence in our restaurants to be more nimble and innovative in digital, access, menu and the restaurant environment and to execute better to deliver on our commitments to our guests, our employees and our shareholders. And now, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yeah. Hi, thank you. Just on the 2Q, the implication is with four points of price, I think that you saw some negative traffic and I guess how do you turn that around? And, in particular, you talked about really a lot of growth in digital usage. But do you think you're substituting \u2013 just substituting from walk-in orders? Or can you actually tell that these orders are incremental? And are you starting to build a database of your customers that might allow for better targeted marketing? Thanks. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question. Obviously, I think I did mention in the early remarks, a lot of our new transaction driving initiatives are getting ready to head to pilot and we also are working on some new marketing communication as well. So, I think as those things start to enter markets and then we gain learnings on how to improve those programs and then plan for national execution, the goal is to use the stage gate process than to inform what our sales transaction performance is going to be going forward. The good news is our price increase that we passed-through has passed-through nicely. We're not seeing customer accounts retreat versus anything we've seen historically when we take pricing. I mean regarding your question on digital sales, obviously there's multiple elements to that, right? There's the delivery aspect. There's our catering and then there's also the app or website orders. And we see varying degrees of incrementality across each of those spaces. The thing that we do know though is, when we get a digital orders through that second make-line, the economics of that order are very attractive and then our customer satisfaction scores also are very attractive. So, we continue to see improvements on accuracy and speed at which we're getting people the food they want, when they want, where they want it. So, still a lot to learn and actually when we get the pilot going on our loyalty program, I think that's going to give us another level of insight in understanding on exactly how all these transactions are interacting with each other and that's a new skill we're going to be building for the organization going forward. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino. Please proceed with your question. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi, good afternoon. Just maybe a clarification question on the comps for the quarter. Could you maybe explain how the trend transpired as the quarter progressed? It's not as if on the last call you might have started a little slow and then maybe picked up later in the quarter. But is that accurate? Or how should we think about that? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, David. I think that is accurate. We talked on the last call that in April because of weather and the seasonal shift of Easter that we got off to a slow start. May was a great month for us. That's when we had the DoorDash promotion, so May looked great. And then June settled in right at about the overall average for the month, so I would say the overall comp of 3.3% is a good kind of gauge for what the underlying trend was, a little less in April more in May, but then we settled out right in the middle in June. So, we feel good about the way that we ended the quarter and how we're entering the third quarter now. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. That's helpful. And then I guess, Jack or Brian, that does suggest a little bit of underlying improvement in at least the way we look at the business on a sequential basis on traffic. So, could you maybe talk about what you think drove that improvement, whether it was the operations improvements you talked about? And then on the operations improvement, in particular, is there any sort of deeper look at that data that would suggest that's moving the needle as you kind of split the restaurants that are doing the best from the worst apart from one another? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I don't think it was just one thing. The good news is, though, as I mentioned earlier, we've seen improvement in our operations on all the key metrics. And we continue to hear more and more positive customer feedback on their experiences and fewer, or a reduction in customer complaints. And we believe there's even more opportunity for us to get even better on throughput going forward, so we're pleased with the progress we're making on ops. We also saw in the quarter people really responded positively to the advertising that we put out there, and then obviously, we've seen very positive responses to varying elements of our digital program. So, I think it was a combination of multiple things, not one thing that drove it and that's what has us excited about how we're moving forward with all the pilots across the business. We're making progress, I think, on ops. We're making progress on digital, and we're making progress on really understanding our customer base better. So that, look, we get the brands, the right message then with the right food at the right place with the right value. I think we'll continue to see improvement in our performance. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your questions. Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.: (26:09-26:14) culture of accountability. Could you talk a little bit more about maybe how it's changed to work in the store day-to-day and how are you aligning that with incentives to have the employees make these changes? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Hey, Nicole, I think we missed the first part of your question. Could you just start from the beginning? Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Absolutely. Thank you. So asking about the culture of accountability, and I thought it was helpful how you talked about how that translated to the customer engagement or improved guest satisfaction. So, what I'm wondering is from the employee perspective, in that store, how is it different to work there today than before, and what are the incentives that you have put in place to keep them aligned with your culture of accountability? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for the question. Obviously, one of the things that I think Scott has done a nice job in the field is the accountability is both on developing a great team as well as being accountable to providing a great experience for the customer. So, I think we're starting to see our teams being more staffed correctly, engaged at another level than where they had been over the last couple years, and everybody has clarity on what their role is on the team. And I think we've talked about this in the past. But, we've given everybody their kind of top five responsibilities, which then gives the team the ability to trust that each other is going to be doing what they need to do for them to be successful. And then to your question on incentives, yeah, we moved to some quarterly bonus programs. And we've seen that actually have a material impact on our employee satisfaction with \u2013 when they make great progress then they get rewarded much closer to when they have that success. So, I think it's a combination really of making sure that we're holding ourselves accountable to great experience, but also holding ourselves accountable to develop a great team and then obviously rewarding them when they have successes. Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.: And then just a final question, when you think about the structural framework previously of a $2 million AUV translating loosely to a 20% store level margin. You're doing that, yet you have over 3 percentage points of marketing that is at least twice as much as what it had been historically. So, it seems that there might be more leverage in the model. Is there any kind of framework you could give or update for us to think about as we model going forward? Thanks. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, Nicole. We've also got M&R just a little high as well. So, I mean, the results we're seeing in the last couple of quarters, give us even more confidence that the model at $2 million gets you right about in that high-teens to 20% margin. And as we grow the volume from there, we think we can move back up into the 20-plus percent margin. So, the things that we thought the model can do, I think we're starting to see that they're coming to life. Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good evening. Brian, you mentioned some statistics earlier about how the fast casual occasion perhaps overlaps with that of fast food in some ways with younger generations and that trial seems to be important with those consumers. I'm trying to understand, what you're seeing and saying about the opportunity there in the past? I think Chipotle tried to get trial going coupons and the like with this understanding that if you get trial they'll come back. But how are you thinking about marketing perhaps different than that and using the data you're seeing? Thanks. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Sure. Yeah. So, I think I mentioned this in our call a couple weeks ago. We've got a big foundational consumer study out and we're starting to get some top line in. And what we have definitely seen is when people try the brand and have a positive experience with it, their intent to stay with the brand is much higher than a lot of our competitors in both fast casual as well as fast food. And it's very exciting because when we look at younger people we're getting even more positive response to intent and then intent to stick with us. So, that's what I was referencing. And in the brand obviously, I think we all instinctually see this, it is very much a purpose-driven brand that syncs up nicely with Gen Z and Millennials and we're seeing that play out in our research as well. So, we're going to want to continue to build on that strength as we move forward. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And Jack, you mentioned the restructuring expense that you expect. I know, it's not typical necessarily in the sector, but could you talk about the dollar savings you anticipate, or maybe the return on investment from these store closures and restructuring expenses and the timing of that? Any color would be helpful. Thanks. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, David. The restaurants we're closing, these are all cash flow losing restaurants. We've got about half of them closed right now. So kind of take before we can see the full effect, we're going to have them all closed. But we should pick-up somewhere in the 20 basis points, 30 basis points of margin once they're all closed. So, there's a definite improvement in our margin returns from that standpoint. Most of the other costs that's more with restructuring the organization, they're going to be returned on that. It's not going to be as black and white or linear. The return is going to be on having a culture that's more innovative, a culture that's more results-oriented and we think there's going to be lots and lots of benefit there, but it's going to be less of a cause and effect where we can tell you what the actual return is. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Jared Garber - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, this is actually Jared on for Karen. Can you guys give us a sense of maybe delivery as a percent of your total sales at this point and maybe just some context about how delivery is contributing to stronger comp in 2Q versus 3Q? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, delivery is a piece of that 10% number that I mentioned earlier on our digital sales and what we're seeing is, today we're in 1,700 restaurants. We'll be expanding closer to 2,000 here shortly. Really, the delivery performance not surprising right now what we're seeing is it really is impacted by how we promote it, because we're in the early days of getting people to understand that it's available. I think at the last number I saw we still have over 50% of customers not realizing Chipotle is available for delivery. So, we're seeing some variability in the delivery performance based on how we promote with these partners. The thing that is exciting though is, we are seeing \u2013 when we hit that bump, we don't fall below where we were. So, we're continuing to see progress. And I think over time as we build awareness, build a habit, I think we'll see this play a bigger and bigger role in getting us into an on-premise engagement. Jared Garber - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. And if I could just follow-up with one more. Have you guys seen any learnings early on the new menu test items that you have in test right now? Thanks. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Sure. I think I mentioned this earlier. We're actually \u2013 you've seen the products in our NEXT Kitchen where that's really just the look of operational execution and we're just getting ready to use our stage gate process to move a handful of initiatives into an actual test market, where we'll be at scale, where we'll start to really have true learnings of customer experience, team member experience and then how that plays out on total Chipotle performance. So too early to comment on any of those items right now. Jared Garber - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks for the color. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC : Hey guys. Two things. Just on \u2013 can you help us understand as you start to lap, I think, you mentioned, Jack, the July issues last year in Virginia just how we should think about that maybe 500 basis points or 600 basis points decline in traffic kind of coming back? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, Andy. There's a couple things going on right now. We're also comparing against, right now, SAVOR.WAVS. So, we did see a nice uptick in a comp in the last week or so as we compare it to the soft tail from last year, but SAVOR.WAVS happened as well which there was a big BOGO, a lot of buy-one, get-one and so that's creating a little bit of noise, but we do expect to see much more attractive traffic and much more attractive sales comps over the next several weeks. And that'll only be slowed a bit as we compare to the launch of last year, which I talked about in my prepared comments. So, yeah, we're already seeing the positive effect from the comparison to last year, to the softness from last year. Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC : Got you. And then anything on sort of pricing as you do the research on the brand? The ability to be a more regular menu price increase taker instead of every several years as has been the case in the past? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah. So one of the things, we're definitely looking to understand is exactly the health of our value equation. The good news is our value continues to be very strong, and what we're assessing right now is, what is the right approach to sequence in pricing over time, making sure, we don't ever get ahead of a great value equation. So, that's part of the consumer research, frankly, that we've got going on right now. As we get those learnings back, it will inform, how we approach pricing going forward. Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please proceed with your question Jeff Priester - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. This is actually Jeff Priester on for Jeff Bernstein. Operationally, given all these initiatives, including your potential new items coming from the NEXT Kitchen and I know in New York some of the pickup shelves around the end of your actual make line. Is there going to be an issue down the line where implementing some of these initiatives, where you need to expand the line or reorganize it to get some of these things out there? And then I have one follow-up. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. So, I think I mentioned this before. Obviously, everything we're looking at has to be thoughtfully executed, so that the throughput engine of Chipotle is not jeopardized. And I think I mentioned this earlier, there's some projects that frankly just are bolt-ons. So like a digital shelf pickup. That actually improves the customer experience and the team member experience, because it eliminates that confusion for where the mobile order person is supposed to go, that awkward moment at the cashier. It eliminates a lot of that. So, that in our opinion is a throughput enabler, because two things happen. One, it merchandises the fact that you can do this mobile ordering and not have to go through the line. And then the second piece is, it really takes advantage of our second make-line, which is I think a huge advantage to open up an off-premise business. But look, the varying initiatives, if it comes with needs for new equipment, we'll test out the new equipment and make sure that it works and plays nicely with the throughput engine that we have. If it doesn't, then that's why we use the stage gate process to learn and figure out how we try again. And it's going to be an iterative process with us. So, I'm very excited that we're going to start the process of seeing some of these pilots get into market, so that we protect the integrity of what's made Chipotle great, while we figure out how we enhance relevance and dial up engagement. Jeff Priester - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. And then on delivery, can you give us a sense of the average check you're seeing relative to your dining customer and then as well as the number of customers per order, the number of entr\u00e9es per order, however you want to approach it? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, we see obviously a nice increase in our digital orders. So the mobile and delivery orders are in that $16 to $17 range versus our traditional check is in the $12 range. And we're still learning, frankly, what is the order size that comes with it versus additional attachments like chips and guac and queso and so on and so forth. But we're really seeing a blend right now of both. There are times we see more add-ons and then there are times where clearly it's a larger group occasion that's off-premise that's ordering through the app or through the delivery third-party. Jeff Priester - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Unknown Speaker : Hi, this Brandon (39:38) on for John. I believe on the first quarter call, you mentioned that you expected marketing and promo to be elevated throughout the remainder of the year. Do you still expect that to play out throughout the back half of 2018 here? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yes, it will be a little elevated. We were light in the first quarter. We were 3.2%. This past quarter, we'll be right at about that same 3.2%. So, overall for the year, we'll average right at about 3% for the overall year. Unknown Speaker : Got it, Okay. And then I just had a follow-up. You mentioned in your prepared remarks restaurant AB and guest set scores are beginning to trend in the right direction. Could you elaborate on that comment, maybe quantify some of those improvements? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yes. So, the restaurant AB is the measurement tool that we use that's a couple of metrics that are very important to us that cover financials, people, guest experience and the team, okay. And what we're happy to see is we're seeing a nice move from Bs to As, and that's a good sign. So, it's a very important metric. It's one that Scott keeps a laser eye on and it's a good way for us to understand how we're performing in our restaurants and how we're actually making progress. Unknown Speaker : Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Jake Bartlett with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. Jake Rowland Bartlett - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking the question. First, I just wanted to get a sense for how much of the initiatives are driving or how much the improved outlook in the back half is driven by the initiatives or driven by the easy compares? And I know with in terms of the initiatives, there's a lot of unknown timing, but maybe if you could talk about what you do know. For instance, I believe when you get your study back on the consumer that that's going to be the source of a new advertising campaign, maybe some impact of the change in the new catering menu. I'm thinking about the shelf roll-out. You just mentioned how kind of a no-brainer it is. I mean is that really a test that's going on? Or is that just kind of, should we expect that to be rolled out here in the back half? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: You know what, I didn't hear the last part of your question, but let me answer the first part, which is, as we talked about our guidance, it's got nearly zero on the initiatives that we've been talking about that we are putting into pilot and that we're going to start expanding over the course of the year. And what we're seeing right now, I think is what I mentioned earlier, which is, I think we're seeing a nice improvement in our operational performance. I think we've got more visible, more effective, more relevant marketing out there and I think we've done a nice job of expanding access to our digital efforts. I think it's going to continue to be the combination of all those things plus as we get some learning on loyalty and potentially some new menus items down the road, that we'll see initiatives play hopefully a bigger role going forward. But as of right now, there's \u2013 I think it's very minimal. And what was the second part of your question? Jake Rowland Bartlett - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: The second part was just your initiative like the shelves, the pickup shelves. You mentioned kind of it's a no-brainer operationally. I mean what is the obstacles to just kind of rolling that out and not considering the test, but kind of just seeing a roll out. What is there to test with them? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah. So look I think as an organization we're going to be a test and learn organization before we go launch. And even though going into where we put it in these five stores, our early indication were it's a no-brainer. The good news is in the first five stores it went as we hoped. And as a result, we're expanding now four, five markets in virtual order and the goal is keep assuming we continue to see the positive performance. We'll get it across the system very shortly thereafter. Jake Rowland Bartlett - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. And Jack a clarification on the tax guidance. I'm just looking if I think about adjusted earnings and comparable to the $2.87 that you mentioned today, I look at the adjusted tax rate there and it's 28.5% is my estimate. So, when you think about the third quarter effective tax rate that you've mentioned in the fourth quarter is that more relevant to GAAP earnings? Or is that relevant to the adjusted earnings we might be focused on? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Those rates are more GAAP earnings. The underlying rates are going to be more similar to what we talked about on our last call. So, the higher tax rate that you're seeing this time compared to what we talked about on our first quarter call are directly attributable to the fact that we've got all these charges. It's just pushing our income down and so it ends up pushing our rates up. When we normalize our earnings like, for example, in this quarter, our normal tax rate would be at that 28.5% range. Jake Rowland Bartlett - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. And then last question, just because I think there is some confusion around depreciation as I look at different estimates fairly-wide range. Could you help us understand what is accelerated depreciation in 2018 and will not going to occur in 2019? And maybe whether you think that depreciation as a whole would be potentially less in 2019 than the 2018 overall? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, 2019 will definitely be less. We're at a higher level this year. Let's call it 30 basis points or so. That's due to two things. One is due to retiring assets as a result of our refresh. We're investing in operating our restaurant. So that requires accelerated depreciation on the items that are going to be taken out of the restaurant. And then secondly part of the restaurant that haven't closed yet, we leave a little bit on the books, GAAP requires that you leave a little bit of the asset on the books and then you right that off over the remaining time that you expect to have restaurants to be open. And so as the M&R that we're doing the refresh that we're doing as that depreciation levels off, that'll be replaced by this higher depreciation from the stores that we're going to close, but that should fall off. Most of it should fall off this year, maybe in early next year and then our depreciation should go to more than normal historical rates. Jake Rowland Bartlett - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session and I would like to turn the call back over to Chipotle CEO, Brian Niccol for closing remarks. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Okay. Well, thank you everybody. I know this is a busy earnings time, so I appreciate everybody taking the time to listening to our results and have a discussion of the business. And thanks again and I'm sure we'll be in touch. Take care. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

We will start today's call with some prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A period. And now, I will turn the call over to Brian Niccol. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Coralie, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report our third quarter results, which demonstrated that our strategies to win today and cultivate a better future are working. Total overall sales grew 8.6% to $1.2 billion, driven by comparable restaurant sales increases of 4.4%, and 28 new restaurants opened in the quarter. The positive comp sales trends enabled us to expand restaurant level margin, which were up 260 basis points year-over-year, to 18.7%. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual cost grew 62%, to $2.16, and our GAAP earnings were $1.36. While the quarter experienced some sales headwinds, we had a noticeable lift in sales with the launch of our new 'For Real' marketing campaign in late September. And that increase has sustained through October. Marketing that drives culture, drives difference, and drives purchase combined with great operations, drives results. Additionally in Q3, key growth initiatives moved forward at a healthy pace. And the team executed with excellence the relocation, the restructuring, the hiring of new talent, and our All Managers' Conference. We exited the quarter with momentum, which sets us up for a solid fourth quarter. And we remain focused on building a culture of innovation and great execution that will drive sustainable long-term growth. Before I dive deeper into this quarter's bright spots, I'd like to take a step back to remind you that our strategy to win today and cultivate the future is based on five focus areas : one, becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand that builds love and loyalty; two, digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience to create a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience; three, running great restaurants with great hospitality and throughput; four, being disciplined and focused to enhance our powerful economic model; and five, building a great culture that can innovate and execute across digital, access, menu, and the restaurant experience. This quarter, we made strides towards becoming a more culturally relevant and engaging brand. Our 'For Real' campaign celebrates what is uniquely Chipotle, that our food reflects our belief that there is a connection between how food is raised and prepared and how it tastes. Real flavors, real ingredients, and real cooking techniques result in food that simply tastes better. We are making much better use of our advertising budget by more effectively communicating who we are and by being in better communication channels, thereby increasing our resonance and visibility. We'll continue to be present on national TV through the middle of November, and the 'For Real' messaging will remain visible in digital and social channels for the balance of the year. Going forward, you can expect Chipotle to have a presence in national media where and when it makes sense and to have an always-on social and digital program. While we are a brand that speaks to everyone, our consumer research tells us that we are particularly relevant to millennials and Gen Z consumers who share our values. And our customers also want to be our employees. During September, we hosted our All Managers' Conference and it was clear from looking at our general managers and field leaders in the audience, that they reflect our customer base. Our teams came away from this conference energized around our purpose, our values, and our goals, and ready to get back to their restaurants armed with inspiration and information on how to improve the hiring experience, the training experience, and the guest experience. In Q3, we made progress on our purpose of cultivating a better world with the announcement of a new accelerator program called the Chipotle Aluminaries Project. This is funded by our Chipotle Cultivate Foundation to help food-focused growth stage ventures that share our belief of cultivating a better world and are seeking to disrupt the current food landscape and take their business to the next level. We are using insights from our consumer research to refine our innovation pipeline and how we communicate with our guests. We continue to hear that the number one reason that consumers eat elsewhere is because they don't have convenient access to Chipotle. Expanding the reach of our digital system remains a key priority in providing our guests with easier access and greater convenience. The digitized second make lines are now in nearly 750 restaurants, and continue to be on track to be in all restaurants by the end of next year. The digital pick-up shelves are now in nearly 350 restaurants, and we are moving quickly to get them in all our restaurants before the middle of 2019. We continued to build momentum in digital this quarter, with digital sales growing 48%, accelerating from the year-over-year growth rates we saw in the first half of this year, and now accounting for 11.2% of sales. App downloads have increased 25% since last quarter, and we are seeing strong interest from new and infrequent customers as well as frequent customers. As was the case last quarter, we are seeing particularly strong momentum from delivery. In Q2, we added DoorDash as a new partner, and in Q3, we added delivery capabilities directly from our app and website. A free delivery promotion from our app in September drove an acceleration in delivery sales in the quarter. We continue to see good incrementality in delivery and we see very little customer overlap between our in-app delivery and our third-party delivery partner app. We are pleased with how delivery in our app is attracting and retaining new and lapsed customers, and the results we're seeing across our delivery channel has validated our strategy to be available wherever and however our guests want to access us. As we continue to remove friction from the digital ordering and pick-up process, we would expect our delivery time advantage to continue to widen. Our current average delivery time is under 30 minutes, already making us one of the most attractive choices for customers on our delivery partners' website, and this will keep getting better. As part of our goal to increase access, we are also exploring new formats that leverage digitally-enabled convenient. We're pleased with the early results from our initial digital pick-up lane restaurants and we will expand this test to additional new restaurants in 2019 across several markets. These restaurants have a convenient drive-up window for guests to pick-up digital orders. It's clear from these tests that our guests appreciate the added convenience as these restaurants generate digital sales that are far above our national average. This format is also a win for operations, as the window leverages our digital make-line. We're also excited about our loyalty test, which launched in September in three test markets. It's very early, but sign-ups look promising, and we'll evaluate and learn from the loyalty test as it moves through the stage-gates in preparation for national launch during 2019. We also have a number of menu items going through our new stage-gate process so that we can build a pipeline for future years. We're testing quesadillas, nachos, bacon, lemonade and a Mexican chocolate milkshake for example. These items are in different phases of the stage-gate process. Importantly, we're improving our ability to deliver great innovations for our customers and restaurant teams with a new concept screening process, more consumer insight, and a better cross-functional process from idea to launch. Lastly, I'd like to touch on where we are in our organizational transformation. At our all-managers conference last month, we rolled out our new values. These are, One, the line is the moment of truth. Two, teach and taste Chipotle. Three, authenticity lives here. And four, the movement is real. These values were very well received at the conference by our restaurant managers who are more energized than ever. We also emphasized the following key areas for operations to focus on going forward. Number one, throughput excellence, number two, team stability and development, number three, great tasting food, and number four, great customer hospitality. We did a number of store visits following the conference and asked our restaurant managers what they took away. I'm happy to say we are aligned from the support center to each individual restaurant. These values and focus areas also form the foundation for the culture we are building in our support centers, which exist to serve our general managers and team members so that they can delight our guests. I'm pleased with the significant progress we've made in rebuilding Chipotle into an organization with an inclusive culture that sets us up to be more innovative, more connected to what our guests want, and better at executing, so that we can capitalize on the tremendous growth opportunities in front of us. I'm delighted with the great talent that we're attracting, as well as the talent that we relocated. We've continued to enhance our leadership team, adding Roger Theodoredis as General Counsel, who joins us from WhiteWave. The restructuring and the relocations are nearing completion, and we are building an organization with best-in-class and diverse talent. I love the start-up energy that greets me every day I come in. Finally, before I turn it over to Jack, I want to thank all of our team members across the company that are providing our guests with a great experience, serving real food cooked to perfection and prepared in our restaurants with fresh ingredients. I'd also like to thank our general managers, who collectively did a great job managing the restaurant P&Ls during quarter three, enabling Chipotle to deliver on financial commitment. Okay. Over to you, Jack. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thanks, Brian. I'm equally pleased with how our team rose to the occasion and didn't miss a beat, despite managing a significant restructuring, to deliver a solid quarter and create sales momentum that has carried into the fourth quarter. We generated revenue of $1.2 billion during the quarter, an increase of 8.6% from last year, and comp sales growth of 4.4%. Restaurant level margins of 18.7% expanded 260 basis points from last year, contributing to underlying earnings per share, adjusted for unusual items up 62%, to $2.16. The third quarter had unusual expenses, mostly related to the transformation. And that negatively impacted our tax rate and our earnings per share by about $0.80, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $1.36. As discussed last quarter, we'll continue to see costs over the next two quarters associated with our restructuring, relocation, and underperforming store closures. In Q3, we recognized $26 million in total charges, with $10 million related to underperforming or closed restaurant, and $16 million related to the organizational restructuring and other unusual expenses. As a result of the transformation, as well as non-cash tax items, our reported effective tax rate increased to 36.8%, or about 690 basis points higher than our underlying effective tax rate of 29.9%, which I'll explain later. The Q3 comp of 4.4% was primarily driven by a higher-average tax on the price increase taken last November and January. And to a lesser extent, the addition of queso to our menu. During the quarter, comps were in the mid-single digits during July and August, before softening to low-single digits in September, when we compare to the advertised launch of queso in 2017. With the launch of our 'For Real' campaign, with national TV in late September, comps moved back up and are running 4% so far in October. Looking to Q4, we'll lap the price increase in about 1,000 restaurants in November, which will be a headwind to our overall Q4 comp by about 100 basis points. We would typically provide a first glimpse of our comp guidance for 2019 right now. But with the growing pipeline of initiatives still early on in a stage-gate process, we'll hold off in providing 2019 comp guidance until we have a better perspective of the timing and expected impact of each of these initiatives. We opened 28 new restaurants in the quarter, and continue to expect to be at the lower end of our 130 to 150 new openings guidance for the full year. Our new restaurants this year have opened at stronger levels, and we continue to emphasize high-quality, high-returning new restaurants as we build out the pipeline. As a result of these strong unit economics, combined with a healthy pipeline for next year's openings, we expect to open between 140 to 155 new restaurants in 2019. As mentioned on our last call, we expect to close between 55 and 65 underperforming restaurants. In the third quarter we closed 32 of these restaurants, and 38 in total, including the six closed in Q2, all related to the restructuring. The remaining underperforming restaurants will close over the next several quarters, as we pursue strategic alternatives to manage our future rent liability. Food costs for the quarter were 33.4%, a decrease of 160 basis points from the 35% in Q3 of last year. The decrease from last year was driven by the menu price increase, as well as more favorable avocado prices. These were offset by elevated prices for beef and paper and packaging items. We expect to be in the low 33% range in Q4, with the slight decrease from Q3 due to the shift in the supply of avocados back to Mexico, Peru, and Chile. Labor costs for the quarter were 27.2%, or flat compared to Q3 of last year. The price increase offset wage inflation of about 4% to 5%. We also decreased our worker's comp liability by about $4 million in the quarter, due to better management of claims activity so far this year. We expect labor costs to increase to the mid 28% range in Q4, as a result of deleverage from seasonally-lower sales, as well as continued wage pressure. Occupancy costs for the quarter were 7.1%, a decrease of 30 basis points from Q3 last year, and that's due mostly to the increase in comp sales. Other operating costs for the quarter were 13.7%, a decrease of 70 basis points from Q3 of last year. Our marketing and promo costs were 2.5% in the quarter, a decrease of about 70 basis points compared to Q3 of last year. The lower-than-expected marketing in Q3 is due to a timing shift into Q4 as our 'For Real' campaign began in late September and will continue through mid-November. As a result, we expect marketing and promo cost will be in the low 4% of sales during Q4, while full-year marketing and promo will still be right around 3% of sales overall for the year. Other operating costs continue to include about 30 basis points of higher maintenance and repair costs, which we first discussed on the Q4 2017 call, and we expect M&R to continue at this elevated level for the rest of the year before abating in 2019. SG&A in the quarter increased $24 million compared to Q2 of this year, the increase compared to last quarter was primarily due to $16 million in charges related to the restructuring and other unusual charges in the quarter, as well as $11 million for our biennial all-manager conference. Compared to Q3 of last year, the items I just listed mostly offset the one-time charge we had in the same quarter of last year. Underlying G&A increased compared to last year, primarily in support of our restaurant growth and digitizing our restaurant experience and operational leadership changes in the field. For Q4, we expect total G&A to be right around $95 million, which includes an estimated $10 million to $12 million of restructuring related expenses. Underlying G&A in Q4, excluding bonuses and stock comp, is expected to be at similar levels as Q2 and Q3 of this year, however, both bonuses and stock comp are expected to be higher year-over-year as a result of better performance. Depreciation for the quarter was 4.3%, an increase of 60 basis points from the 3.7% in Q3 of last year. This increase is due to the accelerated depreciation for the restaurant closures we discussed earlier and to a lesser extent, accelerated depreciation from the office closure. We now expect transformation costs from restructuring and restaurant closures and certain other charges to total between $100 million and $120 million versus our initial estimate of $115 million and $135 million, again, with most hitting in 2018. So, far this year, we've charged nearly $70 million, and we estimate that another $10 million to $25 million will hit in Q4. And the remaining charges mostly related to terminating restaurant and office leases will still end in 2019. We'll continue to provide specifics on future transformation related costs when we have more certainty around timing and we'll break out the unusual costs for normal costs you can follow the underlying trends. Our pre-tax income was $50.5 million, and reported effective tax rate was 36.8%. Our 36.8% recorded effective tax rate was higher than our 29.9% underlying rate due to the transformation costs and non-cash tax items related to the write-off of deferred tax assets associated with the underwater option. While we anticipate the underlying rate in Q4 to remain in the 28.9% to 29.9% range, we anticipate our effective Q4 tax rate to be in the high 30% range or higher through the impact of transformation changes as well as anticipated additional non-cash tax write-offs. During the quarter, we repurchased $19 million of our stock at an average price of $474 per share, leaving about $100 million in our current buyback authorization. Our buyback rate will remain at this lower level, as we fund the transformation cost. This decrease is short term, and we expect to return opportunistically repurchasing shares at a higher level once we've completed the restructuring. We're encouraged by our third quarter results, as our team has demonstrated that they can stay focused on serving our guests and executing growth drivers, while also being nimble on managing the business. Meanwhile, our support center made important progress in relocating and hiring talent, hosting our All Managers' Conference, and rebuilding an organizational structure designed to innovate and deliver on commitments to our guests, to our employees, and to our shareholders. And now, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : We will now being the question-and-answer session. The first question will come from David Tarantino of Baird. Please go ahead. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions on the comp trend. First, Brian or Jack, could you maybe talk about your estimate of the impact, if there was any, from the Ohio incident that was pretty well publicized? And I guess based on how you look at the business looking at maybe your average daily sales trend and seasonally adjust for that, do you think this most recent uplift from the marketing program has got you back on trend, if there was an impact in Q3? And then I have a couple follow-ups. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, David, this is Jack. There was a lot going on in the quarter. We compared in the middle of the quarter to some soft results from last year. We had Avocado Day that turned into a double day, once we broke the internet. We had a back-to-school promotion, then we compared to queso, then we had marketing at the end. So teasing out any single impact was very difficult. That's why I walked through and I wanted to give the comp trends throughout the quarter. The thing that we know for sure is that marketing did have an impact. As we went on air and as customers started seeing the commercials, we did see an improvement in our sales. And I think when I look through the net-net of it, by the time we left the quarter, I don't think there's any lasting impact of anything that happened in Ohio. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. That's helpful, Jack. And then on the quarter to-date, you mentioned up 4% for the comp. I know you're cycling now the mix benefits that you had with the queso. So I guess is traffic now running positive in the quarter-to-date period behind the advertising? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: David, it's right around flattish. When you look at the 4%, we're still carrying a price increase in about a couple thousand restaurants. We'll lap the next wave in November and then the final wave in January. So, I'd call the traffic right around flat. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. And then last question for Brian, you talked a lot about the stage-gate process with some of the menu innovation you're working on. So I guess at a high level, when do you think we'll start seeing some new items added to the menu? And then, if you can maybe share your perspective on what you've learned in adding new items to the menu in this operating model. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Sure. So yeah, we've got obviously a couple items in the stage-gate process, all in various stages actually, both digital initiatives as well as food initiatives. And I think you're going to see both a digital total system from loyalty to our mobile app to our digital shelves. All those things are in test markets right now. And we're very optimistic about what we're seeing. And we're continuing to learn, and the plan is they will start to touch in 2019, consumers; same thing with a food initiative or two. So, we're still early days, David, but we're learning a lot. We're optimistic about what we're seeing. And we're feeling like this stage-gate process is working, and it's going to set us up to execute with excellence on some of these initiatives coming to market in 2019. David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Sounds great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. There were a couple of operational initiatives, Brian, you talked about either on or offline during the quarter, including throughput seemed like an early opportunity for you, and I think you talked about maybe purchasing, professionalizing that organization. Just some of the operational things that you're taking on, where are you on those, and did they have any impact on the past quarter? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: So, we are early days into both of those, and the good news is, I would say our operational focus, I feel like we're out of the starting blocks with getting our throughput to a higher level than where we've been. But really our focus was, at that All Managers' Conference to get everybody aligned on values so that we're hiring the right people. So that ultimately we can end up with a stable team with the right leaders. And then the other key focus for that meeting was to make sure people understood we're getting back to the throughput excellence, great-tasting food. You do those two things, you end up with great customer hospitality. And what I love is I feel like we're out of the blocks on all these things. And we should \u2013 as we go into 2019, we'll continue to make progress as opposed to just getting started with it in 2019. And the same thing goes for the supply chain leadership. Carlos, actually myself, and Jack, we've already started our visits with some of our key partners, and it's been great to understand the relationships that were started, in some cases, 25 years ago, to some that are relatively new. And the good news is, I think this is an iterative process where there's opportunities for Chipotle and our suppliers to benefit going forward. So I'm very optimistic on both of those fronts, and I feel like a lot of good work has been put in place so that when we walk into 2019, we'll start to see some real tangible benefits. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just one more for me. On the digital sales growth this quarter, which was impressive, are you seeing the operational benefits you hoped? Particularly some of maybe the margin benefits you hoped, utilizing the second make-line? Or is it too early, and you have to get sort of a threshold of volume going through that second make-line to really start to see some of the margin leverage benefit that you might expect? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, I think it's a little too early on the margin side of it. But one of the things that's been great to see is where we have the digital make-line, where we have our shelves, and you've got, obviously, the customer app everywhere. We're seeing increases in customer satisfaction, and we're continuing to see a higher ticket. And it's playing across all those digital channels that you would expect, the app, the web, and in delivery. John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Nicole Miller of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you. Good afternoon. It seems to me you've had \u2013 or you're in the midst of a headquarter cultural reset in combination with what is store alignment that could be very powerful. So I'm curious, what are today's store-level incentive metrics? And I've noticed on some of my visits some customer contacts in the dining room, and I'm wondering if that's a particular element that you're focusing on? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely. We are very much focused on, we want people to walk away from Chipotle with a top guest experience. I think you heard me mention this. When we say the line is the moment of truth, we believe the whole stage is set from the second you see our line. And those are both digital lines, as well as our customer-facing lines. And I think what Scott and his team have been also focused on is we've got to make sure our hospitality matches that line experience. So, you will see some table touches. You'll see what Scott calls his four cornerstones start to roll out across the system. So, I'm delighted to hear that you're seeing that first-hand. Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.: And could you speak more specifically about the incentive metrics for the store-level employees? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Sure. We can talk a bit more about that. Scott, I don't know if you want to chime in here, but this is all based on our restaurant AB (27:31) scorecard. So why don't you take that? Scott Boatwright - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Hi, Nicole. Good to hear from you. Scott here. Yeah, so our incentives currently are tied to our AB (27:38) scorecard, which encompasses sales and profits, obviously, but also incorporates the guest experience, food safety obviously being paramount to our business. So when we ladder that up, we understand where we are from a business unit perspective. And everyone's striving to reach the A level. We've made great progress this year of getting there. So hopefully that answers your question around incentives specifically. Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.: That's very helpful. And just a last question. Brian, when you first talked to us a couple conference calls ago, you talked a lot about enhancing and aiding the Chipotle awareness. And today I heard you talk about customers wanting accessibility. So could you compare and contrast those opportunities? And how are you approaching and prioritizing the strategies and tactics between those two opportunities? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: I think you have picked up on what I think are the two biggest levers outside of our operational excellence, around throughput and great hospitality. I think what you just saw with the 'For Real' marketing campaign \u2013 and this is what meant by being more visible, and also being more focused on what makes Chipotle unique, different. So you're going to continue to see us push very hard on getting across what makes Chipotle different, what makes Chipotle driving food culture. And then obviously, we want our marketing to be driving the purchase as well. And I think that can be done at the brand level, which is very exciting for Chipotle. Because I think our purpose is powerful. The other big lever for us is access, and I think it's going to be driven by this digital access. So, those are two things that we are very focused on getting front-and-center. And then obviously, I think there are opportunities for menu variety and a few other things that we talked about. But probably the two biggest focus areas here in the very near-term are the visibility of the Chipotle brand and purpose. Because I think we're creating a new category with folks, and changing food culture. And when we're much more visible with it, customers respond. And then the digital access aspect is another place where we're seeing great response across that whole digital system that we're rolling out. Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.: So is it fair maybe for us to think about awareness is really generating the call to action, and the access is just reducing the friction to get to you? Is that right? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Well said. I should have started there. Nicole M. Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you for your time, appreciate it. Congratulations. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. I got two follow-ups. One is just on traffic. I think in the past we've heard there's been a bit of a struggle with frequency, in the sense of just all tiers of customers maybe coming a little bit less. And I was wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing there? Is this where loyalty comes in? Or is it the new menu items that'll bring people back more frequently? So besides access, what are customers telling you that they want to see most, in order to ramp up that frequency curve, which used to be such a tailwind to Chipotle comps? And then I'll have another one. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Sure. So, yes, what we've seen \u2013 and this is early days \u2013 is with our loyalty pilot, we're seeing people that have less frequency entering the program. And we don't have enough time to truly understand what ultimately is going to be the impact on their frequency. But we're very excited about the cohort that we're seeing come into the loyalty program in the early days. So we think that is going to play out where that program will be a key vehicle for driving frequency among key cohorts that today have an opportunity to increase the frequency. The other thing that's been really exciting is a lot of our digital business is attracting new and lapsed users to our business. So that's been another real exciting learning for us. Then I think your point on what about the people that historically were coming all the time? I think that's where we need to get back to talking about what makes Chipotle unique in culture, specifically food culture, what makes our purpose so different. Because that really resonates with our heavy users that are bought in. And we've seen some early indications that that's a great way to drive frequency into our loyalists. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you, that's helpful. And then just on the unit, you were sort of at the low-end of the range this year, but obviously will be above that in fiscal 2019, according to guidance. I'm just trying to understand the extent to which this year's build rate was maybe a function of re-establishing your growth pipeline or your development, how you approach it, versus just the how many attractive trade areas are left? And next year, I guess, would we expect to see more of a mix shift towards some of the newer, less established? Or are you going to continue to mostly focus on these established markets? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: I'll answer and then I'll let Jack chime in as well. But yeah, look, what we're really excited about is the restaurants that we opened this year opened very strong. And the economics support continuing to open Chipotle restaurants above the rate at which we opened this year. And I think that was the guidance we just shared with you all. The thing that's also exciting about Chipotle is we're finding we're having success in some new formats. As I mentioned in the earlier statements, the digital pick-up lane is a very exciting proposition. We're going to do more of those next year. We're also very excited about how we're seeing success in proven markets, and the new markets that we tapped the brakes on, frankly, a while ago. But the economic model of new restaurant openings is very powerful. And as such, we're building the pipeline accordingly, so that where the opportunities present itself, we can take advantage of those. Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah. The only thing, Brian, I would add is, Sara, we did increase the quality this year, and that showed. We've got better economics this year than we have in the past few. We were more discerning. We were more selective. We did focus more of our attention in the proven and fully-developed markets. But we also had great success in some of the new and developing. So I think by being discerning, both in our proven markets and our developing and new markets, we've got better quality. I think that sets the table now, for us to take this stairstep up that we talked about next year. And I fully expect if we continue to build this kind of quality, we'll look for another stairstep the year after. So we focus on quality first and then quantity second. Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much, very helpful. Operator : The next question will come from Andy Barish of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC : Hi, good afternoon. Just wondering if you could \u2013 I know you've probably given us a bunch of thoughts coming out of your consumer research, but more importantly, on pricing for next year, any initial conclusions on how you're going to approach pricing versus the historical practice of a larger price increase every several years? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: I'll let Jack \u2013 go ahead, Jack. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, Andy, we have mentioned on previous calls, we're open to a whole different approach. We're in the early stages of talking to some outside parties about our menu compared to competition, customers that shop within our menu, and are there opportunities? I think you'll more likely see us take smaller price increases rather than wait two or three years or so and then take a larger one, but nothing to report right now. Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on again, looking out to next year, having 'For Real' for the full year, how do you anticipate the marketing windows to fall versus, obviously, the late roll this year? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah. So we are still in the planning phases on exactly when and where we want to use national media. But what we feel really good about is we believe we've got the right communication, and now we're working through how we use the right communication vehicles at the right time. But what we do know is we'll have an always-on social, mobile, digital effort. And then we're still working through how we use the traditional mediums throughout the year in 2019. Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : The next question comes from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good afternoon. I guess just a follow-up to Andy's questions. 3% for marketing, how are you arriving at that as the right number? And how do we think about that going into 2019? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah. So we believe 3% is the right number based on what our planning process is sharing with us. We're using our stage-gate process to really understand what does each initiative provide, as far as growth goes, layered on top of our throughput effort. And what we've seen is as of right now, as we re-approach the marketing budget, we're going to change the allocation from a lot of local marketing to more national. And in that switch, it changes the level of visibility that we can achieve with our marketing dollar. What should happen is, our 3% should feel like we're much bigger than what our 3% has been historically. And that's our ingoing assumption. Obviously if we find, through our stage-gate process, that we have an opportunity to enhance the marketing, because the result matches the increased investment, then we'll do that opportunistically. But the going-in plan is to make more out of the 3% than we have in the past. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: Can I ask just a quick follow-up? For your 2018, what percent of that marketing budget is digital? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Chris? Do you know that off the top of your head? Christopher Brandt - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: I don't know the answer off the top. And I don't know that we necessarily want to give everybody a clue into that. But clearly, with our consumer base skewing more millennial and more Gen Z, that digital is an integral part of the program for us. And one of the things we have a lot of things going on with stage-gate, in terms of five initiatives. But even the media that we're running, we're constantly in a state of where we look at how it goes and how we evaluate it, and how it moves the business. And we'll feel free to shift things between more traditional linear media and digital media as the results warrant. Sharon Zackfia - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks, a couple follow-ups for me as well. You talked about operations, digital menu innovation, and obviously you've done a lot of research and testing. But if you were to rank your biggest bucket or buckets of opportunity from this point, how would you do that, in terms of what is going to be the biggest source of improvement? I think the assumption might be new menu news being the unlock from here, but wanted to hear your thoughts. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, look, I don't think new menu news is the primary unlock. I think it plays a role. But I think the digital access, removing friction, and getting into digital access is a big unlock for the Chipotle business. Throughput, reclaiming our throughput capability is another big unlock. And then obviously, I think making the brand more visible and more resonant with this 'For Real' campaign is another unlock. So menu will play a role. But I think you're going to find digital and the combination of throughput, and reminding people why they love Chipotle are going to be big unlocks. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And Jack, in the past, you've had these rules of thumbs about margins, restaurant-level margins, and their commensurate level of sales per unit. How has your thinking been changing on that? Obviously you see innovation in delivery or things that bring complexity, and you think that could be margin dilutive. And on the other side, you've talked about productivity. And of course, there's labor inflation and pricing. Have you really shifted how you think about what margins are possible at what levels of sales? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: No, David, we go through and study this carefully. I think everything with digital, with delivery, we feel good that any time there's an added cost, that there's an opportunity for inefficiency there. So I still think when we get to $2.1 million, we can be in the 21% margin. $2.2 million is a 22% margin. Wage inflation is a bit of a wildcard. We can't overcome that with transaction growth alone. That will require some careful timing and place in a menu price increase. But if we can (41:57) well-thought-out menu price increases to make sure that we manage labor inflation, the model is still intact. And there's efficiencies of moving our customers from the front line to the second make-line. And then it's a matter of working with our delivery partners to make sure that the economics work for both us and them. But everything I've said in the past, David, still intact. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Two quick housekeeping questions and I have another one. What was the actual cost to the manager conference in the quarter? And what are you looking for first stock comp for the year? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: What was the numbers for the conference? John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: It was like, $10 million in the quarter, $11 million for the year. Stock comp for the year is in the \u2013 between $60 million and $65 million. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And then, as we've started to see some of the marketing digital initiatives take hold, is there anything you're seeing, in terms of regional variations, in the comp performance? And what I'm really getting at are markets that might be thought of as having more competition in the overall fast-casual space, and specifically with concepts that share a lot of the same philosophies and values around food quality and sourcing. Are those regions keeping pace with the system? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah. We're not seeing big variations in performance based on the initiatives that we've rolled out to date. When we've done our stage-gate process, we've tried to be true to representing the full United States, so we get a picture of how this performs across the country. So no, we've not seen that issue. Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Matt McGinley of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI : Thank you. On the labor rate in the quarter, you did a good job of managing that relative to what you had anticipated, or told us what it would be in July. What improved relative to what you had assumed back in July? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: I missed the first part of your question. Sorry, you cut out. Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI : The labor rate looked a little better than you had guided in July, and I'm curious what came in better than what you had anticipated, from a labor standpoint? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah, two things. Our teams worked really hard to manage workers comp and workers comp is something that you don't see the benefit week-by-week or month-by-month. But we saw steady progress throughout the year, and so we were able to make an adjustment there. And then secondly, Scott and the team, they challenged the team during the third quarter to really take a close look at staffing and making sure you got the right people throughout the day. And so we saw some efficiency gained throughout the quarter as well. So those are the two things. And I agree with you that we did a nicer job with labor in the third quarter than we did in the second quarter. Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI : In the quarter, you ran a few offers to grow digital usage. I think you ran a BOGO and you had the free delivery offer. Did that have any impact on the margin? And is promotion something that you would use on a go-forward basis to drive utilization of that? Or would you expect it to be more of just a more natural increase in digital usages as awareness of the platform builds? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Let me answer the latter part of the question, then I can hand it back to Jack on your margin question. Yeah, what we have seen is when we increase awareness of the digital platforms, we get a good response. And I think over time, our loyalty program and using analytics to inform how we incentivize behaviors is going be the future. You'll see us continue to use what I would call broad scale incentives as we build the database and get people into our loyalty program, get people using the mobile app. But where we're ultimately headed is we want \u2013 I think we're less than 50% awareness on these digital platforms. We need to improve that dramatically. And then once we get them into the platform, we need to create a capability around using analytics to drive the right incentives for the right cohort at the right time. So with that approach, we think good things happen throughout the entire P&L. But Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything else. John R. Hartung - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah. Listen, I think that was well said. Yes, it does have a theoretical impact on our margin. We give away guacamole. Guacamole, our customers love it. It comes with more than 50% of our transactions. And we gave away a lot of it that we planned on giving it away for one day. We gave it away for two days. But not anything that I would call out when you look at $1.2 billion in sales over the entire quarter. It wasn't material enough to look at. But it's an investment worth making, because we attracted a lot of people into our digital platform, and so it's an investment that will pay off. So it has a theoretical impact on the margin, but not enough to call out during the quarter. Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeffrey A. Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thank you very much. Two questions. One, just following up on the unit growth discussion. Clearly, you're upping the absolute number in 2019. I'm just wondering how you actually arrive at that absolute number? You talked about how there's lots of opportunities and different types of stores that you could do. I know a few years back you were doing well north of 200 stores a year. So I'm wondering how do you think about, maybe what are the guardrails or challenges to a greater stairstep in growth? I don't know if you think there's certain markets that are at saturation, or is it real-estate availability, or cost to build or quality of managers? I'm just wondering what keeps you from ramping up that number more meaningfully in the short-term? Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Look I think one of the things that always have to go hand in hand with new restaurants is having managers ready to take over those new restaurants. So you have to take it at a measured pace as we increase year to year. Because the last thing you want to be doing is opening restaurants ahead of your capability to run them. The good news is, I think our economic model suggests we still have room to grow in a meaningful way. And the Chipotle employee value proposition is very compelling. So we're able to attract managers, apprentices, to get them prepared and developed so that they can be part of the growth story as well. So it's really that balancing act if you got to have the teams ready to work and lead the restaurant, coupled with making sure you've got the right economic sites available to open it in. You can't just all of a sudden \u2013 well, you could, but we're not going to just go guardrail to guardrail on this thing. I think we would find ourselves not executing very well. So those are the principles we're using. Jeffrey A. Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And then you mentioned the unlocks earlier, which I thought was interesting. You didn't mention anything about, I guess, maybe extended store hours. I know there was some talk of selling burritos earlier in the day or going into breakfast store. I know certain markets you're now doing more late-night initiatives. I'm just wondering how you assess what extended hours might work, what might not work, and the potential opportunity. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Yeah. I think one of things we learned through the stage-gate process is ours is going to be a surgical approach. It's not a blunt initiative. And so I'm delighted that we learned that in pilots, as opposed to on a national level. You'll see our hours be very surgical. Where it makes sense, you'll see us have some different hours. But it's not going to be a national, blunt effort. Jeffrey A. Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understood. Thank you. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Sure. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Brian R. Niccol - Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, everybody, for listening and joining in. I think as I said in my earlier remarks, very proud of what this team has accomplished in the third quarter. I do believe our strategy to win today and cultivate the future is making tremendous progress. The team that we're building in the support center, I am very excited about diversity of the talent and the caliber of the talent. I'm also very excited about how we've moved all these initiatives forward while moving the company to a new cultural space through this relocation and restructuring. So the Chipotle brand continues to be a purpose-driven brand that we continue to learn, over and over again, means a lot to our customers, means a lot to our team members, and very proud of what we accomplished to date, and also very optimistic about the pipeline that we're building and the initiatives that we're focused on going forward. So, thank you for taking the time. And I look forward to speaking with all of you in the future. Take care. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Additionally, I am also happy to share that we have hired our Chief Development Officer, Tabassum Zalotrawala in December and therefore completing my executive leadership team. I am confident Tabassum will make a terrific contribution to our development organization. With that, I am very pleased to report strong fourth quarter results with 6.1% comparable restaurant sales growth that included 2% transaction growth, restaurant level margins of 17%, 210 basis points over last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items with $1.72. I am also pleased to report for the full year 2018 restaurant average unit volumes achieved $2 million and our digital business went beyond $0.5 billion, representing 10.9% of sales. The growth acceleration this quarter gives us confidence that our strategy to win today and create the future is working. When we connect with guests through culturally relevant marketing focused on Chipotle\u2019s great taste and real ingredients and provide more convenient access with less friction, they respond enthusiastically. I am excited about the momentum we built heading into 2019. Now before I talk about the future, let me review the many positive changes at Chipotle during 2018 by going through the five key pillars that drive our purpose of cultivating a better world. The first is to be more visible with culturally relevant communication and the innovation that increases brand engagement. Our marketing mandate is to drive culture, drive a difference and ultimately drive a Chipotle purchase. In late September, we launched our For Real advertising showcasing Chipotle\u2019s point of difference in real ingredients and real cooking techniques. We drove significant awareness of the brand through a holistic media plan on culturally relevant programming. We published our entire ingredient list for the world to see in Times Square across numerous social and digital channels, a full page ad in the New York Times and in our restaurants with the headline, the hardest ingredient to pronounce at Chipotle is Chipotle. The next iteration of the For Real campaign called Behind the Foil is launching February 11 and builds on this success. It feels more like a documentary than traditional advertising. It showcases our fresh ingredients, food preparation and celebrates the work our talented team members do everyday in our restaurants to provide our guests a great dining experience. Our free delivery bowl offering which ran from December 17 to January 7 help to expand access and was not only a great way to attract new guests to our app and delivery capabilities, but also to Chipotle as nearly half of the guests taking part in this offer were new or lapsed users. Collectively, these marketing initiatives help drive a noticeable lift in sales during the second half of the year. Additionally, beginning January 2, we launched our first menu innovation called Lifestyle Bowls for mobile and web orders that really resonated with consumers in a big way. It generated over 1.3 billion earned media impressions in the first few days of January. Overall, Chris Brandt and his team have done a great job of making Chipotle more visible in culturally relevant social and traditional media channels. For example, our 2018 overall digital impressions increased nearly 20% year-over-year, while social impressions increased nearly 40% year-over-year. This was all accomplished without increasing our overall marketing budget. Going forward, you can expect Chipotle to continue to be a part of culture, have our presence in national media where and when it makes sense and to have an always on social and digital program. I am excited about the continued evolution of our marketing strategy as I look into our 2019 plans. Our second pillar is to digitize and modernize our restaurant experience with enhanced access and less friction creating a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience. We continue to hear the number one reason consumers eat elsewhere is because they don\u2019t have convenient access to Chipotle. In 2018, we opened 137 new restaurants with industry leading returns and will continue to be one of the leaders in developing new restaurants. For our existing restaurants, we completed the big fix and stayed focused on expanding the reach of our digital system to provide our guests easier access and greater convenience. The digitized make lines are now in over 1,000 restaurants and remain on track to be in all restaurants by the end of 2019. The digital pickup shelves are in approximately 1,000 restaurants and we are moving quickly to get them in all our restaurants by the middle of 2019. Curt Garner and his team continued to build momentum in digital this quarter, with digital sales growing 66% year-over-year, an acceleration from the 48% we saw last quarter. Digital sales totaled $158.6 million during the fourth quarter and represented 12.9% of sales. For the full year, digital sales exceeded a $0.5 billion and accounted for 10.9% of sales. App downloads increased 72% year-over-year in 2018 and we continue to see strong interest from new and frequent as well as frequent guests at Chipotle. Similar to last quarter, we saw particularly strong traction in delivery. Although off of a relatively low base, delivery sales increased roughly 13 fold compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. The free delivery bowl promotion drove growth in the latter part of December offsetting normal expected seasonality. Encouragingly, we are seeing some residual lift in delivery sales that last beyond the promotion and have seen very little guest overlap between our own in-app delivery and our third-party delivery partner apps. As we continue to remove friction from the digital ordering and pickup process, we expect our delivery time advantage to continue to widen. Based on data shared with us by our white label delivery partner, we are consistently among the quickest delivery times in their system and we expect this to only get better with the addition of pickup shelves and delivery prepay capabilities that enable delivery drivers to walk in, pickup their order and walkout without any delays. As part of our goal to increase access, we are also exploring a new format that leverages digitally enabled convenience. Our test of the initial 10 restaurants with the mobile order pickup lane that we call Chipotlane is showing promising results with a higher mix of digital sales and total restaurant sales. We will continue to explore and learn about this opportunity by opening a few dozen more Chipotlanes in 2019 with a mix of freestanding and end-cap building. These restaurants are a great extension of our digital system as they help to increase convenience and access to Chipotle. We are also encouraged by our loyalty test sign-ups and early user data. As we have seen with our app, we are seeing a nice mix of new lapsed and medium frequency guests. And while it\u2019s still early days, we are pleased to see changes in behavior across all frequency bands. Our stage-gate process is working and we are making changes based on the feedback received thus far and remain on track for a national launch in 2019. Our third pillar is to run restaurants with great hospitality and fast throughput in a great environment. During Q4, we rolled out several operational improvement initiatives to drive better food, feel and flow. This includes training that reiterates our four pillars of hospitality, which are be and look your best, be guest obsessed, surprised and delight and make it right. In an effort to enhance our best-in-class food safety program, we adopted a quarterly food safety training requirement, which trains crew members on their role in keeping our food safe every quarter. In addition, we implemented a new prep process, we call focus prep. Focus prep reduces the number of people preparing our great food, which makes it more consistent as well as food safe. Ancillary benefits include better service as our hospitality teams are now singularly focused on delivering a great guest experience. And the GM is now in a position to lead the restaurant versus managing every single process of the production. Our teams have embraced this new process quickly and we are already seeing benefits from the rollout. In the coming year, Scott Boatwright and his team are focused on team stability, throughput and consistently great tasting food. Additionally, reducing turnover particularly at the GM level through better leadership training and a clear direction on career progression are critical factors to our long-term success. Internally, we are calling this the year of the General Manager. We are also doubling down on throughput training and providing our teams with an easy to use dashboard that provides greater visibility on their throughput performance. Lastly, we are elevating our culinary prowess through chef-driven cooking demonstrations as well as consistently executed line tastings to ensure our food is cooked to perfection everyday. In the first half of 2019, we are also launching Cultivate You 2.0, whereby we bring leadership training to the restaurant General Manager level to further drive in-market talent development. As a reminder, we retrained all of our field leaders during Cultivate You sessions at our corporate support centers throughout 2018. We previewed many of these initiatives at our All Managers Conference last fall and our managers know that when I am visiting with them in their restaurants, I\u2019m always going to ask their team, how is the culture and how is throughput here? I am going to ask our general managers about team stability, the development of our team members and obviously the Food Safety Seven. And of course, since we are a restaurant company, we are going to be doing food tastings. It\u2019s clear from my numerous restaurant visits this quarter that Scott and his field leadership team are making tremendous progress and are focused on the right operational initiative. The fourth pillar is to be disciplined and focused in order to enhance our powerful economic model. Our biggest lever remains sales and transactions growth. Over the past year, we have become more strategic about pursuing projects that generate sales growth and healthy returns. We are in the process of building sales growth layers for multiple years and putting them through our stage gate process to ensure we are learning and iterating prior to national launches. While we are focused on winning today, we are also cultivating our future. Last but not least, we are building a great culture of accountability and creativity. This is one of the things I am most pleased about as we have made significant progress during 2018 in rebuilding Chipotle into an organization with an inclusive culture that sets us up to be more innovative, more connected to what our guest want and better at executing so that we can capitalize on the tremendous growth opportunities ahead of us. Our people are our biggest asset and I could not be more proud of the team we have assembled. With our restructuring and relocation largely behind us, we are well on our way to building an organization with best-in-class and diverse talent that is dramatically improving our ability to deliver great food and service to our guests. I love the energy and enthusiasm I see everyday when I am with our employees, in our restaurants, and in our support centers. Chipotle has always thrived by being different, by being the best version of ourselves, not another version of someone else. And we have earned the deep loyalty of our guests, because we are different and deliver a unique experience and being different means always changing. Right now, we are investing in many areas that further position us to win. So as you think about 2019, the main initiatives that ladder up to our five key pillars are : digital system investments, which includes pickup shelves, digitized make lines, loyalty and delivery; marketing programs that celebrate our real ingredients and classic cooking techniques; elevating our core menu by developing innovation that leads food culture and meets guest requests and lifestyle; and of course, a dedication to improving operations with General Manager stability and development, excellent throughput, consistently great food, all in a great restaurant environment. With that, let me conclude by thanking all of our team members for their belief in Chipotle. Their dedication and passion provide our guests with a great experience serving real food, cooked to perfection and prepared in our restaurants with fresh ingredients. Their efforts are helping Chipotle cultivate a better world. We have an exciting journey ahead of us and while we accomplished a great deal in 2018, I believe the best is yet to come. With that, here is Jack to walk you through the financials. Jack Hartung : Thanks, Brian. I am really pleased with the high-quality fourth quarter results, which provide a glimpse of our powerful economic model and a leverage we can deliver, we drive top line sales and provide a great guest experience. Our marketing and digital strategies led to increased guest visits and our restaurant teams responded by ensuring every guest enjoyed a delicious meal. Our revenue was $1.2 billion during the quarter, an increase of 10.4% from last year and comp sales growth of 6.1%, our highest comp in six quarters. Restaurant level margins of 17% expanded 210 basis points over last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items, was $1.72. The fourth quarter had unusual expenses mostly related to the transformation and these negatively impacted our earnings per share by about $0.57 leading to GAAP earnings per share of $1.15. For the full year, sales were $4.9 billion on a comp sales increase of 4%. Restaurant level margins were 18.7%, up 180 basis points and we generated earnings per share adjusted for unusual expenses of $9.06, an increase of 33% over last year. Unusual expenses, mostly related to the transformation, negatively impacted our earnings per share by $2.75 leading to GAAP earnings of $6.31. In Q4, we recognized $23 million in non-recurring expenses, with $7 million related to underperforming or closed restaurants and $16 million related to the organizational restructuring and other unusual expenses. We continue to expect transformation cost from the restructuring and restaurant closures as well as certain other charges to total between $100 million and $120 million. We recognized about $91 million of these charges during 2018 and expect that the remaining $9 million to $29 million will hit in the first half of 2019. We will continue to provide specifics on the transformation-related costs each quarter, so you can follow the underlying trend. The Q4 comp of 6.1% was driven by a trend change in transactions as 2% of the comp came from greater guest visits along with a higher average check. The check increase includes a price increase of 3.3%, which was a result of increases taken in late 2017 and in January of 2018 and a mix contribution of 0.8%. Our For Real campaign during the quarter really resonated with our guests and the Free Delivery Bowl campaign in late December made it easier than ever for our customers to enjoy Chipotle. We expect full year comps in 2019 will be in the mid single-digit range with the recent modest price increase contributing about 1.7%. This is lower than the 4% price increase seen in 2018. We are optimistic that with the recent trend change in transactions plus the modest price increase combined with our 2019 growth initiatives, a mid single-digit comp is achievable. We opened 40 new restaurants in the quarter bringing our total count to 137 for the full year. The new restaurants opened in 2018 have continued to open up strong as our development teams have done a great job emphasizing high-quality and high returning sites. For 2019, we continue to expect to open between 140 to 155 new restaurants, but these openings will be weighted towards the second half of the year. We expect about 10% of these openings will occur in Q1 and about 25% will open in Q2. Food costs for the quarter were 33.2%, slightly lower than Q3 due to price increases as well as lower avocado prices based on our seasonal shift from California to sourcing from Mexico, Chile and Peru. We expect food costs to be approximately 33% in Q1 as the slight leverage from the December menu price increase is largely offset by an expected increase in beef prices. We also expect food costs for the full year to be about 33% as an expected rise in avocado prices this summer will be offset by other efficiencies. Our new supply chain team is now fully in place and we set to find efficiencies later in the year by strategically reviewing this sourcing of all of our ingredients. We will keep you updated as these potential opportunities arise. Labor costs for the quarter were 27.1%, a decrease of 40 basis points from last year. Our restaurant teams did a nice job of scheduling and managing labor in the quarter while labor inflation in the 4% to 5% range was partially offset by the menu price increase. We expect Q1 in the full year labor to be in the low 27% range as leverage from the menu price increase and sales growth is expected to largely offset ongoing wage inflation in the 4% to 5% range. Other operating costs for the quarter were 15.5%, a decrease of 30 basis points from Q4 of last year and that was due to sales leverage. Marketing and promo costs were 4.2%, an increase of about 40 basis points compared to Q4 of last year and that funded our For Real campaign in the fall as well as our Free Delivery Bowl campaign in late December. Marketing and promo finished the year at 2.9% of sales and we expect to invest about 3% of sales in 2019 and this includes investing in the low to mid 3% range in Q1, which is higher than the 1.8% we spent last year in Q1 as we launch our Behind the Foil campaign next week. Other operating costs were also higher due to the inclusion of delivery fees, which rose with the increase in our delivery sales. For 2019, we expect other operating costs to be in the 14% of sales or perhaps slightly lower as sales leverage and M&R efficiencies are expected to be offset by our fast growing delivery business. G&A for the full year was 7.7% of sales or $375 million, which included $32 million related to the transformation and other unusual expenses, $64 million in stock compensation and nearly $11 million related to our biennial All Manager Conference. Without these items, our underlying G&A support totaled about $270 million in 2018. In 2019, we expect our underlying G&A support to be in the $275 million to $280 million range. Our annual stock comp is typically approved and granted in Q1, so we will be able to provide updated clarity during our next earnings call. And this underlying G&A does not include non-recurring transformation costs, which will continue to clearly call out each quarter. Depreciation expense for the quarter was 4.3%, an increase of 60 basis points from Q4 of last year and it\u2019s increased due to the accelerated depreciation from the restaurant closures as we discussed earlier and to a lesser extent the accelerated depreciation from our office closures and we expect depreciation to be about 4% in 2019. Our GAAP tax rate during the quarter was 26.3%, which is slightly lower than our underlying rate of 27.4%. For 2019, we expect our underlying effective rate to be in the 27% to 30% range. While expected 2019 underlying effective rate has settled into a tighter range than it was throughout 2018, it maybe effective from time-to-time by items such as executive comp related adjustments or deferred tax assets related to previously issued equity and we will fully disclose these adjustments as they occur. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investments balance of $677 million as of December 31. This allowed us to repurchase $45 million of our stock at an average price of $452 per share during the fourth quarter. And for the full year, we repurchased $161 million at an average of $370 per share. We also funded CapEx during the year totaling $287 million, which is lower than the $300 million we guided early last year as we reprioritized our CapEx to support our new strategies. In 2019, we expect CapEx will be around $300 million with around 40% to 45% invested in new restaurants, 30% to be invested in growth-related initiatives, including digitized second make lines and digital pickup shelves and the remaining invested in normal upkeep of our restaurants and strategic corporate initiatives. Our new restaurant investment will increase to an average of about $860,000 per new opening and that\u2019s mostly as a result of further testing of the Chipotlane. The guests convinced with Chipotlane along with the potential for superior economics support allocating a portion of our portfolio to this new format. In closing, we are encouraged by our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results as our teams remain focused on the guest experience while seamlessly managing a significant restructuring and relocation. The results as a company that is well on its way to building a culture of innovation and great execution that will drive sustainable long-term growth. I am excited about 2019 and I believe we are in a great position to win today and create a bright future for our guests, for our employees and for our shareholders. And now we are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from David Tarantino from Baird. Please go ahead with your question. David Tarantino : Hi, good afternoon and congrats on the progress you made last year. Question I guess on the sales trends first. I think, Jack, you mentioned multiple times change in the trend line during the quarter. So can you maybe elaborate on what you meant by that, maybe talk about how the trends progressed during the quarter? I know you mentioned comps in October were up around 4%, so that implies quite a bit of an acceleration. So can you maybe talk about that and maybe what you are seeing so far in 2019? And then underneath that, Brian, can you maybe give an update on for what you think the impact from that For Real advertising campaign was on the comp trajectory and I know you pulled some of that advertising during the quarter, what kind of tail did you see from that approach when it wasn\u2019t running? Thanks a lot. Jack Hartung : Yes. Hey, David, I will start. We talked about during our third quarter release that the For Real campaign did bring more customers in at that time and we talked about October sales or actually sales in late September moving up to a higher level. We maintain that during October and then through the quarter, October, November, were pretty similar months, David. So even as we are getting near the end of For Real, we held on to those sales and then we had a nice bump at the end of the quarter as we had the Free Delivery Bowls as we were advertising on all the college bowl games and our customers responded in a big way and so that was nice acceleration. I think the things \u2013 the two things that make us really encouraging is that the For Real campaign was just resonating with our customers in terms of Chipotle stands for real food and real cooking and that resonated with customers and then two when we made Chipotle more convenient to our customers by making available through delivery and free delivery during the Free Delivery Bowl campaign. They responded, because it was convenient access and those are two levers that we can continue to pull throughout the year. In terms of January sales, it\u2019s really difficult to give you an underlying trend. We maintain the momentum from the delivery bowls end of the first week of January, because we were advertising and offering the promotion through the BCS Championship game. Then we also introduced the lifestyle bowl as well and that created a lot of buzz and interest and activity as well. And then in the second half of the month, we have weather and so really difficult to give you what the underlying trend is. I can tell you we are just encouraged with what we saw during the quarter and we are optimistic about how 2019 is shaping up. Brian Niccol : Hey, David. This is Brian. The only thing I would add is the thing that was exciting to hear from consumers as well as our team members, is when we started talking about Chipotle, a point of difference in regard to real ingredients, real cooking that results in just better tasting food. Everybody agrees that is why they originally found what with Chipotle and that\u2019s why they\u2019re falling back in love with Chipotle. So the good news is that message is proving be very sticky and I think the team has done a great job of making the brand much more visible with that key point of difference. And it continues to carry momentum with the execution in the restaurant as well as the guest experience that consumers are actually having. So, we are very excited, I think we mentioned obviously, we\u2019re going to continue to pull that string and the team is getting ready to launch kind of the next wave of the For Real campaign through Behind the Foil next week. David Tarantino : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Leo for Sarah. So I have a question on the restaurant margins. It seems that it went up this quarter given the menu price increases, sales leverage, but we were just wondering if there were also some operating efficiency in here and if you could perhaps give more detail on what they might look like in 2019, but ideally some kind of quantification through the supply chain or labor metrics? Thanks. Jack Hartung : Yes. They were efficiencies and we talked about. We started to see efficiencies in the third quarter. And this is the way our field teams and restaurant managers are scheduling and deploying labor. They found ways to get more efficient in the second half of the third quarter that continued into the fourth quarter. And so that definitely drove part of the margin. The rest of it was from sales leverage and a little bit from the price increase. And then going into next year, it\u2019s really going to be more of the same. We are hoping that will or expecting that will hold on to the efficiencies that Scott and his team drove in the second half of this year. We are expecting with a comp guidance that we provided with a very modest price increase that we will be able to offset some of the labor inflation, the biggest challenge is going to be labor inflation. And labor inflation, we expect to continue in that 4% to 5%. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Karen Holthouse : Hi, thanks for taking the question. One quick housekeeping one and then a real question, could you just walk us through given the pricing actions have been taken, why\u2019s that cadence of price through the year will be in 2019 and then there are some encouraging commentary on the loyalty test, in a best-case scenario what one could we think about that getting to a broader rollout? Brian Niccol : Sure. So, the way to thing about pricing is, we take in a price increase of just shy of 2%. And I think we\u2019ve mentioned this in prior calls, we now brought in a partner to help us manage our pricing approach going forward. So, the good news for us is even with the pricing of below 2%, we continue to have the best value scores in the fast-casual segment and we\u2019re always going to want to hang on to that strength. So, any pricing that we will take going forward, will continue to be probably in smaller increments than we\u2019ve done historically, with obviously more frequent basis, and right now we\u2019re working through what that frequency will look like. But through all of it, the thing that we\u2019ve kept our eye on, is how do we maintain the integrity of that value proposition that we provide to our consumers. Your second question on digital, the loyalty program specifically, we\u2019re in the stage gate process with the loyalty program. I think you\u2019ve heard us talk about one of the things we\u2019re delighted to see is one, the enrollments and how this is one of those things that just keeps building on itself. So, you get started with some level of enrollments, you see cohorts of people coming in, the thing that\u2019s nice to see is how those that enroll, utilize the loyalty program in their behaviors. And then what\u2019s nice to see is how that builds throughout time and what we continue to be very optimistic about is the cohorts that we\u2019re seeing are, like last meeting users as well as our heavy users. But the thing that we\u2019re most interested in has the data that we get on this, our ability to then turn around remarket Chipotle to influence people\u2019s behaviors going forward. And we\u2019re still in the early days of understanding a lot of those implications, but so far are very promising, and that\u2019s why we continue to move this through the stage gate process, still on track for 2019 launch. Operator : Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please go ahead with your question. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good afternoon. I\u2019m sorry if I missed this, but I think Brian, you\u2019ve talked quite a bit about throughput and the opportunity there. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s anything where you saw any measurable progress in the fourth quarter? And then I guess just to clarify Sarah\u2019s question, can you just talk about how the price benefit will impact the quarter. So, how much are carrying in first quarter versus full year? Brian Niccol : Yes, I\u2019ll let Jack answer the pricing question here. And then I can answer the other question around throughput. So, go ahead Jack. Jack Hartung : Just make sure price, it\u2019s 1.7 through the first three quarters. And then about 1.3, something like that. We took the pricing in two stages during December. So, it\u2019s pretty much going to be an even 1.7 through 11.5 once a year. Brian Niccol : And then your question on throughput, the guys have actually made a lot of progress on throughput. We just launched our throughput dashboard. And, I think I mentioned this in our All Manager Conference, we reemphasize the pillars of throughput. So, we\u2019re in the process right now, giving our teams visibility that they\u2019ve not had on throughput in a long time. And we\u2019re already starting to see that have an impact on our results. So, it\u2019s very early. But the good news is the dashboard coupled with the focus and going back to the core of what this business was built on, which is fundamentals of great throughput. We\u2019re already seeing an impact in the business. Operator : And our next question comes from Joshua Long from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead with your question. Joshua Long : Great, thank you for taking my question. Kind of following up on that point on throughput, I was curious if you can talk about the opportunity around GM turnover. I know that\u2019s something that you mentioned in your prepared comments, Brian, but just curious on where turnover levels are at now. And then how you think about kind of rebuilding that over the course of 2019 and beyond, if there\u2019s other initiatives in place, or if it\u2019s really a function of just getting the messaging and things that we\u2019ve talked about here thus far in the call and then other venues getting traction with that as we go forward? Brian Niccol : Yes, thanks for the question. I think I mentioned in my remarks earlier, we\u2019re making 2019 the year of the General Manager. And the reason is because, we want to improve the stability of the General Manager level. And we also want to improve the development of our apprentices and General Managers, so that they\u2019re ready to step in the growth opportunities that are going to be presented. It\u2019s a focused effort. We actually have all of our field leaders together here in a couple weeks, where we\u2019re going to be reviewing the best ways to develop future General Managers and future field leaders in this organization. And, Scott and his team are very much focused on keeping stability in the restaurant with our A plus leaders and then those leaders that need development, they get the right development, so they become A plus leaders as well. And I think what you\u2019ll see is that builds a culture of growth both from a standpoint of career opportunity, as well as sales and guest experiences. So, we\u2019re very much focused on continuing with right initiatives to drive more stability, lower turnover at the General Manager level, goes from that, that just gives us a position of strength to get better throughput, better food execution, and better environment for our customers. Joshua Long : I appreciate that color. Thank you so much. In terms of thinking about the Chipotle lane and the prototype that goes along with that. How should we think about that in terms of, for those of us who haven\u2019t necessarily seen it in person and is there an opportunity to shrink some of that square footage as the sales make shifts towards digital and pushing things through or pushing sales through the app rather? Brian Niccol : Yes, so great question. A lot of folks probably have not seen our Chipotle lane. The way First I want to explain it so, you order ahead in the app or on the website and what it does, is it provides another access point at the restaurant where you don\u2019t have to get out of your car. So, you are able to just pull up to a window, our team member then has a quick conversation with you, you just said pickup time and then what happens is, literally it\u2019s like, I\u2019m here for my burrito, out of the window comes your burrito, you never get out of your car. So arguably, it will be possibly the fastest way to Chipotle is going through the Chipotle lane. It does require you though to order in advance and pick your pickup time. We have that in about 10 restaurants right now. The nice thing is we\u2019re seeing both digital sales as well as total restaurant sales elevate with this new access point. To your question about what does it mean from a restaurant design standpoint. This is one of the reason why I\u2019m really excited to have Tabassum on our team. She is going to have the flexibility to think through with this new access point, what are our opportunities to change the footprint of Chipotle, and I think that means finding trade areas that historically we haven\u2019t gone into, because we haven\u2019t had this access point and also finding trade areas where potentially we could have a smaller footprint because of this access point to get into those trade areas. So, it really opens the door, so I think additional convenience with less friction and get people to Chipotle closer to where they want a Chipotle. So, we\u2019re still in the early days, so I do want to make sure people understand that. This is still very much in a testing phase and we will continue to test, learn, iterate throughout 2019 and will be happily sharing the results as we get them. Joshua Long : Great thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. John Glass : Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about delivery. First, how much of the fourth quarter sales particularly, I guess December sales results you ascribe to delivery and particularly that free offer, how much accomplish did that give, you can tease it out? Second, you did offer free delivery earlier in the year. So, it sounds like this time around, it had a greater impact on sales, why do you think that was? And third, maybe Jack, I know, you\u2019ve talked about delivery economics in the past. But just to be clear, when you look at a delivery sale, I think it\u2019s generally understood, it\u2019s lower margin because of the commission, and it\u2019s hard to offset that even if the higher check. Is that the way you think about it, or do you think yours is structured somewhat differently, or somehow there\u2019s a different proposition where you actually see a restaurant margin going up, and it\u2019s accretive not dilutive to restaurant margin, I\u2019m talking about the average margin now, not maybe an incremental margin? Brian Niccol : So, John, I\u2019ll touch on the first part, and then I\u2019ll let Jack share on your margin question. Two things to think about. The first time when we did the delivery promotion, it was not available both through in the app and across the marketplace. Now, delivery is accessible both in our app and across marketplace. The other thing I would share with you is, we now have more coverage of our restaurants than we did when you go back the first-time we did this. The other key piece of the puzzle obviously, is I think our marketing team and Chris did a great job of smartly connecting the idea of delivery to an event, that was happening in a lot of people\u2019s homes that just made the occasion that much more relevant. So, I think it\u2019s a combination of more access, more visibility, the access being in our app, in the marketplace and then the visibility being done through television, tied to an occasion that basically trip to what thought for the consumer, hey, I should be doing Chipotle at home while I\u2019m doing this event. So, I think the combination of all those things just built on top of each other to really drive our delivery business in the fourth quarter. I think I\u2019m excited about it, it is the delivery business continues to stay with Chipotle because the speed at which it gets delivered, I think we talked about this before, we\u2019re still best-in-class when it comes to speed. And the second piece is our food is really great when it gets delivered. That burrito, it\u2019s really delicious. And so, to get people delicious food in roughly 30 minutes at home while they\u2019re watching, whatever they\u2019re watching, it appears to be a good idea for our consumer. Jack, I\u2019ll let you answer the margin question. Jack Hartung : Yes, John, the way to think about the margin first of all is Chipotle is really set up where our operations are geared towards great delivery experience, from through the entire process for our crew, for the driver and for the customer. First of all, let me start with our second make line sales before you consider delivery, is higher margin than our frontline sales, because we start with an advantage there. We have a second make line which means our operator setup who take these extra sales, we\u2019re not running the sales through or the production through the same frontline that our customers are waiting through. We\u2019re investing to make that experience even better with digitizing the second make lines. So, our capacity is going to go up, our accuracy is going to go up, and our timeliness is going to go up. We have stayed at times where when a delivery driver comes in, they know they can come in Chipotle at x time. They know that it\u2019s going to be ready. We are putting shelves in our restaurant as well and we\u2019re about to launch prepaid for even for our delivery partners, so that there is no stopping to pay for the order. So, everything is set up to be very efficient, very seamless in everything we do. There is a delivery fee, but John, right now the incrementality is so high as long as these are extra customers, additional customers coming to Chipotle, we can cover the fee because our morning starts out at a higher level, because it\u2019s incremental. We still can cover the fee and it\u2019s still a accretive. So, it\u2019s not just that it\u2019s profitable, it\u2019s accretive to our margins. The way we\u2019ve got it set up right now. John Glass : And Jack, just to be clear you\u2019re talking about accretive to the consolidated average margin, not an incremental margin that the second make line can offers in higher check or whatever else elements can offset that commission fee, is that the way you look at it? Jack Hartung : That\u2019s right John. When we are at a 19 margin, when we cover the delivery fees, our margins are still much higher than the 19%. Now if you\u2019re going to compare this to an incremental customer that\u2019s going to order on their app and come and pick it up, that is our highest margin transaction in the whole restaurant. When you then attach a delivery fee, it\u2019s going to be lower, but it\u2019s still going to be a very attractive margin and again the way we\u2019ve set this up, it is so convenient for everybody and about our crew, the driver and the customer. We think our growth is just going to continue to grow here we\u2019re just going to continue to be incremental and so you know we\u2019re bullish on where this goes both from the sale as well as margin standpoint. John Glass : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. John Ivankoe : Hi, just a couple if I may. Firstly overall, if we do think a while like what is going to be necessary at this point in terms of adding other customers in terms of your peak day parts are, we at the point now where overall throughput is now at the point where that customer can be reaching. And then secondly in terms of the shoulder periods that we\u2019ve talked about before in between the 2 and 5, for example, if there are now programs in place, again it\u2019s meet, the shoulder periods that couldn\u2019t otherwise being met with the overall peak staffing and day part demand? Brian Niccol : Yes. Hi John, the simple answer is we still have plenty of capacity to handle more throughput during our peaks. I think we\u2019ve mentioned this before, you know, Chipotle in the past was doing $2.5 million on average out of these restaurants and you know, we were doing 35 transactions in 15 minutes and we\u2019re still in the mid-20s today. I\u2019ll be at making progress from the 20, so, you know, Scott, his team know that when we have a line and they go faster, the good news is the line just keeps moving, as opposed to somebody peeling off of the line. And the peak business still has a lot of capacity when we execute throughput really well. So, there\u2019s plenty of upside there. Then your question on the shoulder, you know, the thing that\u2019s great about Chipotle is our proposition really resonates lunch through dinner and consumers are becoming more hour-less on the time of day that they want to eat. And we\u2019re continuing to see us make progress in our throughput in those shoulder hours. But the focus right now is those peaks, how do we get back to where we once were on that throughput because we still have so much headroom in that space. And it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s an impressive operation when you see us operating at our throughput capability, and I think we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, but plenty of headroom, but we have lots of focus to capture that headroom in our peaks. John Ivankoe : Yes. And from your perspective, it\u2019s more of a supply, in other words, a throughput constraint than it has been a demand constraint as the number of customers like you serve for 15 months has been reduced? Brian Niccol : Yes, yes, I mean, look, I think our \u2013 the good news is, we smartly guide our team members focused on their roles, accountability and making great food and now we\u2019re pivoting to, okay, now this is how you do the four pillars of great food, but which was at the core of Chipotle 5 years, 6 years ago. So, we believe we can open more transactions during those peaks by getting people up to speed on what it\u2019s like to run the four pillars of great throughput in a Chipotle. John Ivankoe : That\u2019 great, thank you. And then secondly, if I may, on the supply chain, and I know you talked about this in the past, but in terms of the bigger structural changes that are happening in the supply chain, how far are we in this journey at this point. I mean, obviously, you hire new people, you have new teams, you have new office, and you have a completely clean slate in terms of what Chipotle could be in 2020 versus 2015 or 2014. I mean, I guess how much efficiency and effectiveness opportunity maybe there\u2019s a basis point number, I think we\u2019d all love that. But whatever it is and then maybe there\u2019s a quality number or a service number that you can talk about in terms of the work that you\u2019ve done on the supply chain in terms of how much that could deliver going forward? Brian Niccol : Yes, I think we\u2019ve talked about this and I think you categorize it correctly. We\u2019ve got a new leader with Carlos and we are really taking a clean sheet to how we approach our supply chain. But one caveat, food with integrity is still going to be a key driving principle on how we operate in our supply chain. So that means supporting the farmer, supporting the right animal welfare and then also protecting clean food and farming practices that we believe is the future of food culture. With that said, I think Carlos and his team working with Jack, have already started to identify opportunities for our business that we\u2019re going to attack and as we understand what that really means for the business, I\u2019m sure Jack and myself will update you guys, but right now, it\u2019d be premature to give a specific number, John, on what that entails. But I think it\u2019s part of one of our pillars of doing our business, which is we need to take a disciplined approach to protecting the economic model to pull back and that\u2019s what we task Carlos to do here. So, I don\u2019t know, if you want to add anything to that Jack. Jack Hartung : No, it\u2019s just the only thing I would say, it\u2019s a whole new team as well John. So, we\u2019re fully staffed right now. The team is up and running, it\u2019s really a great team that believes in Chipotle purpose. They believe in Chipotle, our ethos of sourcing high-quality sustained [indiscernible] food, and they\u2019ve had significant outreach to all of our suppliers. So, we\u2019re really optimistic about the team, about the relationship with our suppliers and Brian is right though there\u2019s nothing to report right now, but if there\u2019s opportunities there, I\u2019m confident this team is going to find them. John Ivankoe : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Badishkanian from Citi. Please go ahead with your question. Greg Badishkanian : Great. Thanks. Just your 2019 comp guidance calls for mid-single digit same-store sales. Should we expect an inflection at some point or you think it\u2019s really just kind of a slow and steady march back to the 2.5 million AUV level you achieved 4% last year. So just kind of steady and slower would you expect inflection point? Brian Niccol : Yes, look, obviously I think the way we think about this is, if we do the right marketing with the right communication, our consumers will respond enthusiastically to the Chipotle business. And is that slow and steady, is it inflection, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re focused on. What we\u2019re focused on is, how do we get to a place where we\u2019re communicating the things that are meaningful to people about Chipotle, we\u2019re doing the initiatives that we believe will drive returns and growth and we\u2019re running great operations so that when people come in, they have a world-class experience and they want to come back. I think we do all those things right. We\u2019ll continue to be rewarded with customers\u2019 business and we\u2019ll continue to be rewarded with employee loyalty and engagement. So, we\u2019re optimistic about the various initiatives we have in our stage-gate process and how we\u2019re going to attack growth going forward. But what we\u2019re really zeroed in is, how do we make sure we run great operations, do the right initiatives, and then give the consumer the message that makes them feel good about being a part of Chipotle, that\u2019s when we\u2019ll get rewarded with sales and transactions. How that plays out, we\u2019ll update you guys quarterly. Greg Badishkanian : Alright. Thank you. Brian Niccol : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Brian, you mentioned a few areas of focus for 2019, I\u2019m just wondering as you internally I guess, think about measuring success. I mean, you\u2019re more focused, do you think on the comp to kind of drive kind of acceleration in traffic or do you think about it more as you\u2019ve got the comp momentum back and are you focused more on the margin, just trying to think if this comp upside to \u201819 versus the mid-single digit level, especially because you\u2019re off to a strong start with the initiatives kicking in whether or not you\u2019d be reinvesting that in a variety of initiatives you have or the initiatives really require stage-gating, and therefore, there would be more flow through the margins and earnings in \u201819, if you would have beat that the comp expectation? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, obviously we\u2019re concerned about both, is the way I would respond to your question. We want to invest in the business so that we continue to drive momentum in sales and transactions because the best \u2013 look the best leverage for the economic model here is growing sales and transactions. We do that well, our margins will expand. At the same token, I think this is kind of to somebody\u2019s question earlier, where there\u2019s opportunities to be efficient or take some of the upside to the bottom line, if we don\u2019t have an investment vehicle that would suggest you should go reinvesting, will take it to the bottom line. So, the thing I\u2019m excited about though at Chipotle is, we\u2019ve got a lot of levers and we\u2019re validating with those levers at work through the stage-gate process, whether it\u2019s a delivery program, a loyalty program, a menu innovation or an ops initiative around throughput. We\u2019re starting to better understand how these things play out, both from a top-line and then how it flows to the bottom line, and we\u2019re going to continue to fund that balancing act. Because ultimately, and I think Jack has talked about this in the past, we want to get back to that 24, 25 with margins that would be best-in-class at 24 and 25. So, we\u2019re really striving towards doing both. Jeffrey Bernstein : Got it. Just because you mentioned the delivery and the loyalty in the menu, it seems like you have a variety of initiatives at various stages of rollout as we think about \u201919. And as you started \u2013 like you started in the year strong, it seems like you are back into it maybe December was up in the 10% range. So, obviously, there\u2019s some nuances in short-term trends, but you\u2019re starting very strong. I\u2019m just wondering whether you\u2019re expecting the comp to accelerate through the year or whether for some reason get posting some things and some things out that we shouldn\u2019t expect comps to accelerate through 2019 versus where they are today? Brian Niccol : Yes, look I think we talked about this, right, the fourth quarter, we definitely saw a trend change with the combination of I think improving operations, more penetrated digital system, delivery having more coverage and being more visible about the point of difference in Chipotle. We\u2019re going to keep doing that in 2019, because we believe those are the right strategies to engage with our customers in a unique way. So, what I would say is, we feel really good about the strategies and the programs we have in place. The trick for us in 2019 is executing those with excellence, so that we maximize with each of those at work. But I know \u2013 I think it\u2019s really important for people to understand it\u2019s a multi lever that we\u2019ve got going on here, great operations, a great digital system, more visible marketing that is more resonant than we have been in the past, coupled with some smart innovation, both done in digital and in the menu. So, we\u2019re going to continue to drive that. It served as well in \u201818 and we believe it\u2019s going to continue to serve as well in \u201819. Jeffrey Bernstein : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Barish from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Andy Barish : Yes, just a couple of points on the physical plan. Chipotle lane, are you \u2013 those new builds as well as remodels? And then secondly, on the new stores, could you discuss kind of a recent performance history on new store openings relative to the $2 million system average where those stores are kind of coming in? Brian Niccol : Sure. So, your question on the Chipotle lanes, it is really a new build effort. We are going to do one or two kind of remodel efforts. But the emphasis of this is going to be really a new build approach going forward, at least that\u2019s what our learnings would suggest today. And then your question on the economics around our new openings, they continue to really perform with great opening volumes, as well as terrific returns both on a one-year and two-year basis. Jack, I don\u2019t know if you want to add any \u2013 Jack Hartung : Yes, just Andy, I would say it\u2019s relative to some of the best results we\u2019ve had historically, meaning there are about 80% or even a little bit higher than what our existing mature stores are and so it\u2019s right where we hoped it would be. You might remember a few years ago, we had fallen down to about 70% of the average mature store, so we closed that gap and the quality really is really, really attractive. The team\u2019s done a great job. Andy Barish : Thank you. Operator : And our final question today comes from Andrew Charles from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question. Andrew Charles : Great, thanks. Just Jack one quick housekeeping question, and then Brian, one question for you. Should we interpret mid-single digit same-store sales guidance for 2019 to mean 4% to 6% or 3% to 5%? And then Brian, why doesn\u2019t the effect just play devil\u2019s advocate? What is the effectiveness of the marketing spending you saw in 4Q that 4.2%, what does that lead you to rethink the 3% of marketing spend budget plan for 2019 is clearly efforts are working? Thanks. Jack Hartung : Yes, just a housekeeping real quick, when I say mid low is 1%, 2%, 3%, mid is 4%, 5%, 6%, so I\u2019m saying somewhere in that 4%, 5%, 6% range. Brian Niccol : And yes, your question regard to marketing as a percent of sales. The \u2013 I think the way we thought about this is, how do we have a communication program that will get the brand to be visible, where we want when we want, and to Chris and the teams\u2019 credit, as they\u2019ve looked at the existing budget, we don\u2019t see a problem with being able to allocate those dollars in such a way where we can be, where we want, when we want and how we want to show up. I think we mentioned this in the past, if we find ourselves in a place where look there\u2019s an opportunity for us to go beyond the 3%, we\u2019re not afraid to go do it. But as of right now, we believe reallocating the budget is the better way to go to optimize result we\u2019re looking for right now. But Chris appreciates that question, I\u2019m sure. So, thanks for the question. Andrew Charles : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we\u2019ve reached the end of today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks. Brian Niccol : Okay. Well, thank you everybody for taking the time. I just want to reiterate again, how proud I am of the culture we\u2019re creating here, the leadership team that we\u2019ve put in place over the last 9 months to 10 months, and the fact that our reorganization a lot of it is behind us and what we\u2019re really focused on now is executing our strategies, so that we show up for our customers where they want us, how they want us, and then for our team members, that we continue to develop them, grow them and get the opportunities of growth. I think Chipotle is a one of a kind brands and our goal here going forward is continue to drive that one of the kindness with customers and everybody that chooses to be a part of Chipotle. So, thank you for taking the time and appreciate all the questions. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference call and thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode [Operator instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions [Operator instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ashish Kohli : Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter of 2019 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations Web site at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward looking statements, including projections about comparable restaurant sales growth and new store openings. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K and in our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to gap measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the investor relations section of our Web site. We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. Afterwards, we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. With that, I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian Niccol : Thanks, Ashish and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to report strong Q1 results with 9.9% comparable restaurant sales growth that included 5.8% transaction growth; restaurant level margins up 21%, 150 basis points higher than last year; earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $3.40, representing 60% year-over-year growth; and digital sales growing 101% year-over-year to represent 15.7% of sales. The ongoing improvement in each of these key metrics over the past few quarters gives us confidence that our mission to win today and cultivate the future is resonating. In fact, this is the fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating comps, which reinforces our view that when we connect with guests through culturally relevant marketing, focused on Chipotle's great taste and real ingredients, and provide more convenient access with less friction, they respond enthusiastically. The first quarter strong results were driven by the same strategic focus areas that we've talked about for several quarters now; being culturally relevant and increasing brand engagement and visibility; digitizing and modernizing the restaurant experience; great hospitality and throughput; and of course, enhancing our powerful economic model, all while building a great culture of accountability and creativity. We were definitely visible this quarter with unique marketing programs that celebrate our real ingredients and classic cooking techniques, as well as several initiatives that caught the attention of our guests. As you know, last fall we launched our four-wheel advertising, which showcase Chipotle's point of difference in real ingredients in real cooking techniques. We followed this up with our behind the foil campaign in February to showcase what is fully kitchen looks like every day; real fresh ingredients; real cooking techniques; and real people. Chipotle has always believed that there's a connection between how food is ready and prepared to how it tastes. And what I love most about these commercials is there was no studio, no script, no props and no actors. It was just our employees doing what they do best, which is making delicious food. In addition,Q1 also benefited from several other initiatives that made the Chipotle brand more visible in culturally relevant social and traditional media channels. Our free delivery bowl offering, which ran from December 17 to January 7, helped expand access and was not only a great way to attract new guests or app, and delivery capabilities, but also to Chipotle as nearly half of the guests taking part in this offer were new or last users. And we are seeing increased new customer retention with higher levels of delivery sales after the promotion. We also launched our first digital only menu innovation on January 2nd called Lifestyle Bowls. This resonate with consumers in a big way. In fact, during the first few days, it generated over a billion earned media impressions. Later in the quarter, we extended the Lifestyle menu platforms with plant-powered options, highlighting our Sofritas and Vegetarian Bowls. We're currently testing several other menu items to our stage-gate process and we\u2019ll update you on their progress over time. And finally, we continue to drive awareness of our brand through a holistic media plan with national TV advertising on culturally relevant programming like March Madness, and always-on social media that resonates with our guests. Collectively, these marketing efforts help drive culture, drive the difference and ultimately drive the Chipotle purchase. This contributed to the lift in Q1 sales as evidenced by digital impressions increasing 300% year-over-year and social impressions increasing 400% year-over-year. We are pleased with the returns on our marketing dollars to-date and expect healthy returns from programs being worked on for the remainder of 2019. We\u2019re also excited about Chipotle Rewards, which launched on March 12th. The stage-gate process allowed us to learn, enhance and optimize the program to ensure a better guest experience upon launch. And we're encouraged and have already enrolled 3 million members. The rewards or spend day where customers earn 10 points for every dollar spent and receive a free entr\u00e9e after accruing 1,250 points with periodic bonus offer so real food becomes real treat real fast. In addition to allowing us to reward and thank our guests, we're beginning to gather data that can be used to more effectively target them to engage and grow their loyalty. The Rewards program gives us a currency that we can use to incept behaviors as a key part of our digital system flywheel. Our guests have been asking for a loyalty program for a long time and now the more you eat at Chipotle, the more you can get free Chipotle. We believe that Chipotle rewards will be a key element that will provide topspin for digital system, which was again a key driver of our sales growth. The digital system, which includes order ahead, delivery, catering, digitize second make lines, mobile order pickup shelf and now, Chipotle rewards, is creating a more convenient and enjoyable guest experience, making it easier to order food from Chipotle, however and wherever you like. To that end, I am pleased to share that we recently completed the addition of mobile order pickup shelves in all relevant restaurants. These self-service shelves are a key element in digitizing and modernizing our restaurant experience. As they increase access, speed of service and convenience for our guests, while building more love for Chipotle and driving digital sales. In addition, this is a key component to improve delivery times. The delivery driver no longer waits for orders when they enter our restaurant. They simply go straight to the shelf, select the appropriate order and head off to the delivery destination. We feel this is a competitive advantage and allows us to have industry leading delivery times. I want to thank our teams for their great execution on this initiative. Also with regard to our digital make lines, they're currently in approximately 1,300 restaurants and we expect to have them in all applicable restaurants by the end of 2019. Early results are showing that restaurants of mobile order pickup shelves and digital make lines generate digital sales above our national average. Through a combination of delivery, order ahead and catering, our digital sales accelerated from Q4 and grew 101% year-over-year in quarter one. Digital sales totaled $206 million during the quarter and represented 15.7% of sales. We also re-launched a new chipotle.com website in February that is helping increase customer conversion. We are pleased to be averaging more than 1 million digital transactions per week. Delivery remains a key driver of our digital growth given enhanced capabilities on our app and website, as well as our expanded reach. As I mentioned earlier, we are seeing some residual lift in delivery sales that last beyond any promotion. And I've seen very little guest overlap between our own in app delivery and our third party delivery partner apps. As part of our goal to increase access, we continue to open Chipotlanes and this test will ramp up later in 2019. These restaurants are a great extension of our digital system as they help increase convenience and access to Chipotle for customers looking to pick up digital orders without getting out of their cars. On marketing and digital, we're helping to bring guests into our restaurants, the operations team is determined to deliver a great experience that will keep them coming back. Specifically, we are focused on team stability and development, creating and supporting an inclusive engaged culture, exceptional throughput, consistently delivering great tasting food and food safety. Our field leadership conference last month allowed us to reiterate these messages, while also highlighting the theme that Chipotle is a people driven world class organization. The key part of this is to continue supporting and celebrating our general managers through better leadership training, providing a clear direction on career progression to ensure long term success and great benefits as illustrated by our enhanced tuition assistance program. While early, these efforts are beginning to make a difference. We experienced a solid reduction in overall turnover measures in Q1, which tells us we're on the right path with our people focused initiatives. We are now consistently executing line testings and leveraging chef food and cooking demonstrations to improve the quality of our food. And these efforts are being noticed by guests as measured by our guest experience survey. In addition to these outcomes, we are seeing a modest improvement in throughput, aided by training, focus and providing our teams with an easy to use dashboard that provides greater visibility on performance. We still have more work to do but I am encouraged by the progress thus far. And we are aligned in our approach and believe that great execution will enable Chipotle to capitalize on future growth opportunities. As we continue to evolve our brand and grow the business, it is an honor to welcome Patricia Fili-Krushel and Scott Boatwright to our board of directors. Pat is currently the CEO of the Center for Talent Innovation, and has previously held numerous leadership roles in Comcast, Time Warner and WebMD. Scott recently retired as CFO of Starbucks after a long and successful career. From contributions in global business strategy and talent management to finance and risk management, I'm confident both Pat's and Scott's perspectives and valuable insights will help us accelerate our goals. With that, let me conclude by thanking all of our team members for their belief in Chipotle. Their dedication and passion to provide our guests with a great experience, serving real food cooked to perfection and prepared in our restaurants with fresh ingredients. Whether I'm in our restaurants or in our support centers, I feel the energy and see the right actions being taken day-in day-out. It's this focus and strong execution that has brought us to where we are today. To care, hard work and dedication on the line, in the kitchen and in our support centers, are the reason we are winning in the marketplace. We're off to a great start in 2019. And with our sustained efforts, I believe Chipotle can cultivate a better world. With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials. Jack Hartung : Thanks, Brian and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very pleased to report another strong quarter as both comps and margins accelerated from our last report. The biggest lever to strengthening our economic model has always been comp sales and transaction growth. And the Q1 results illustrate that point as we achieved our highest restaurant level margin in nearly four years. Customer engagement and visits are increasing as a result of a compelling marketing message, more convenient access, including delivery and strong operations. Sales were $1.3 billion in the quarter, an increase of 13.9% from last year and comp sales growth of 9.9%. This 9.9% comp includes a reduction of 30 basis points as a result of deferred revenue from our loyalty program. Restaurant level margins of 21% extended 150 basis points over last year and earnings per share, adjusted for unusual items was $3.40, representing 60% year-over-year growth. The first quarter had unusual expenses related to the transformation, and these negatively impacted our earnings per share by about $0.27, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $3.13. In Q1, we recognized $7.5 million in non-recurring expenses, primarily related to the organizational restructuring. Transformation costs which started last year now total about $98 million, and we continue to expect these charges to total between $100 million and $120 million. The EPS of $3.40 include $7.3 million or $5.5 million on a tax effective basis. And G&A related to higher bonuses, higher non-cash performance based stock comp adjustments and higher employer payroll taxes, all related to our strong performance and the strong performance of our stock. The higher stock price also contributed to a tax benefit of 480 basis points in the quarter. The stock option exercises and RSU vestings at the higher stock price drove excess income tax deductions. This tax benefit offset the higher performance based costs included in G&A, resulting in no net impact to EPS. And I'll talk in more detail about these impacts later. Our Q1 comp of 9.9% was driven by a healthy acceleration in transaction as 5.8% of the comp came from greater guests visits. The higher average stock includes a price impact of roughly 2.5% and a mixed contribution of 2% driven by growth in digital orders, which have a higher average check. With the launch of our Chipotle rewards loyalty program, accounting rules require to deduct or defer revenue for anticipated reward redemptions in our current comp sales. This negatively impacted our Q1 comps by about 30 basis points. We're pleased that our customers have responded enthusiastically for our digital strategies and our culturally relevant marketing, which drove increased guest visits this quarter. And our restaurant teams welcomed our customers by providing a great guest experience. With these strong Q1 sales results, we're increasing our full year comp guidance from mid single digit to mid to high single digit range with price contributing about 2%. Our comparisons get more difficult as the year goes on. And for Q2 specifically, recall that last year's second quarter benefited by about 100 to 200 basis points, and the beginning of our partnership with DoorDash in May and from the start of our spring marketing campaign. Finally, the revenue deferral of 30 basis points in the quarter related to loyalty is expected to increase each quarter as we acquire more customers, and it's likely to hit 100 basis points or more before redemption cause the deferrals to level off. We opened 50 new restaurants in the quarter and returned for new restaurants continue to be strong with projected year two cash on cash returns in the low 40% range. Our development teams continue to emphasize high quality and high returning sites. For 2019, we continue to expect to open between 140 to 155 new restaurants with a waiting towards the second half of the year. We anticipate Q2 openings to be slightly higher than what we saw in Q1. Food costs for the quarter was 32.2%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year as leverage from the December price increase was partially offset by higher protein prices. Our supply chain team drove approximately $2 million in cost savings through more efficient sourcing this quarter. And while we expect to find additional efficiencies, it's too early to quantify the impact, which we expect to materialize later this year or early next. Of course, our number one priority is to continue to pursue high quality sustainably raised ingredients and our pursuit of efficiencies will never be at expense of food quality or food safety. While avocado prices were stable throughout most of the quarter, in late March they began to spike based on higher demand from retailers who've been aggressively advertising the fruit combined with lower expected supply in the short term due to the reduced harvesting for an Easter holiday, and a lighter California crop this summer. We expect Q2 food costs to increase around 100 basis points from Q1. For the full year, we continue to believe food costs will be right around 33%. Labor costs for the quarter were 26.7%, a decrease of 110 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales levers and the menu price increase. We also decreased our workers' comp liability due to better management of claims activity, and we experienced lower unemployment expenses. These benefits were partially offset by labor inflation, which continues to be in the 4% to 5% range. We expect Q2 labor costs to be in the low 26% range as leverage from sales growth and the menu price increase is expected to offset ongoing wage inflation. Other operating costs for the quarter were 13.4%, an increase of 50 basis points from Q1 of last year and higher marketing and promo costs more than offset sales leverage. Marketing and promo costs were 2.5% in the quarter, an increase of about 70 basis points compared to Q1 of last year to fund our behind the foil campaign in February and free delivery bowl campaign in early January. We expect to increase our marketing investment to around 3.5% in Q2, but still expect overall marketing and promo budget for the full year to be right around 3% of sales. Other operating costs were also higher due to the inclusion of delivery fees. Delivery continues to be the fastest growing part of our business with high incrementality. And from a margin standpoint, because of the efficiency of our dedicated second make line along with the high leverage our economic models generates on incremental sales, delivery continues to be accretive for our margins. G&A for the fourth quarter was 7.8% of sales or $103 million, which included nearly $5 million related to transformation expenses, nearly $25 million related to non-cash stock compensation, higher bonus accruals related to our strong performance and payroll taxes and stock option exercises, along with $1.5 million for expenses related to our biannual field leadership conference. Without these items, our underlying G&A support totaled about $72 million right around what we expected. We expect our underlying G&A support to remain around this level for the rest of the year. And while total G&A each quarter should be lower than the $103 million in Q1 as we complete the transformation of our company and those related costs fall out. The total G&A each quarter will vary as a result of these performance based charges and the level of option exercises. As an example, stock comp in the quarter includes an upward revision of $1.9 million in our non-cash stock comp related to performance shares. Unlike stock options and restricted stock grant, the accounting expense associated with performance shares will adjust up or down each quarter over the vesting term based on actual performance. Our annual grants have evolved over the past two years to become more heavily weighted towards these BSUs with the percentage of overall equity grants growing from less than 10% in 2017 to about one third in 2019. While these PSUs, which are tied to improving margins and comps, are effective in aligning company performance and incentive pay for the creation of shareholder value, the variable accounting treatment can cause volatility in our recorded quarterly G&A cost. Another component of G&A that's difficult to project and will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter is the employer payroll taxes and stock option exercises and stock vesting. These costs will vary depending on the stock performance and the timing of when our employees choose to exercise. Depreciation expense for the quarter was $53.8 million, which included $1.8 million of accelerated depreciation related to our digital make line project progressing more quickly than initially anticipated. For the full year, we expect depreciation to be about 4% of sales. Asset retirements were higher this quarter as re-retired assets were identified last year as we completed the big pay. Our effective tax rate was 22% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis, both lower than our communicated range of 27% to 30%. Our effective tax rate benefited from option exercises and restricted share vesting and elevated stock prices. In essence, we receive a tax deduction for the value our employees receive upon option exercise or share vesting. And when that value exceeds the fixed accounting charge for those shares, we benefit from a higher tax deduction. For the remainder of 2019, we expect our underlying tax rate to be at the low end of our previously disclosed 27% to 30% range. Though it may vary quarter-to-quarter based on the factors I just mentioned. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investments totaling $735 million as of March 31. We repurchased $52.4 million of our stock at an average price of $567 per share during the first quarter. Even though there are fewer shares outstanding and trading as a result of these purchases, our diluted weighted average number of shares increased 422,000 shares as a result of more options being in the money given the higher share price. This negatively impacted EPS by $0.05 in the quarter. In closing, we're encouraged by our Q1 results and the progress we're making against our strategic growth plan. We know that [Multiple Speakers] initiatives, many of which are in the early stages will help drive sustainable, long-term growth for Chipotle. This will benefit our guests, our employees and our shareholders, and it will allow us to have a positive impact on how real food is sourced and made accessible, contributing to our vision of cultivating a better world. And now, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator instructions]. Our first question comes from Sarah Senator with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Sarah Senator : I have a question about delivery, if I may. And first part is just, you\u2019ve seen an inflection point, I don't think we've observed in any other limited service in terms of launching delivery and really seeing a change in comp. So I was wondering if you could maybe talk about what you think might be distinct about your context for what you're doing, where you could see that level of incrementality that we're not really seeing perhaps elsewhere. And then just on the margin side, you said it is accretive to margins but then also called that that was a cost headwind. So could you talk a little bit about that? And if there's any opportunity to perhaps lower the cost and delivery, whether it\u2019s the take rates that aggregators have or something else? Thanks. Brian Niccol : So, we\u2019ll answer both of those questions. So your first question, why do we believe Chipotle is a great solution with respect to delivery. I think it's as simple as our food really travels well in the channel. And then when you think about the time and the ease of access to actually get your order in and then the amount of time that it takes for your food to then get you is some of the best in that space. So we're basically removing a lot of obstacles for people, because the app experience or the web experience, I think is one of the best out there. So it's very easy for people to place order. And then when you look at the time for people to get their food from orders at home, again, it's one of the best alternatives out there for that space. So time and time here is delivery drivers love delivering Chipotle food, because of our smart pickup times. So they know the food be ready when they walk into the restaurants, they grab it off those pickup shelves and they go. And there's literally no wasted time in the process. And that's we're going to continue to work towards is removing all the friction so that these deliveries become as efficient as possible. In regard to your question on the margins and incrementality, we continue to see as we give people more access, we get more incremental business. And delivery is one of those occasions that is proving to be highly incremental for the Chipotle business. And on the margin side of things, we are continuing to see with that high level of incrementality it results in a margin accretive proposition. Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything. Jack Hartung : The only thing, Sarah, when we look at delivering, we take the sales. Some of it is trade off that we think is coming from in-store to delivery. Most of it, we think at least two thirds is incremental. But we take our costs associated with that business. So we separate it as a separate business and we've got our food costs, our labor costs and you factor in the delivery costs as well. Our second make line is very, very efficient and our incrementality, our model drive a high margin incrementality, that the margin that we get on the delivery business is higher than the 21%. So if we didn't have delivery, we would not have delivered the 21% margin. Now, I called that out in other that we do have delivery fees in there. So you're going to see that line item is going to be higher. When you take the whole P&L of delivery together, we're generating net incremental margins at a higher than 21%. Operator : The next question comes from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Nicole Miller : Thank you. Good afternoon and congratulations. If you could think about same store sales performance and rank the drivers, it does sound like delivery is number one. But I'm just wondering what TV marketing in past you would suggest there was on comp. And then in terms of delivery, when you think about the 15% or so of sales in delivery, how much was going to your app? And how much is going through other third party marketplace sites? And besides having the ability to keep your data when it comes to your app, what are some of the other economic differences? Brian Niccol : The first piece I just want to clarify the 15.7% is digital. So that's percent of sales in digital. Within that 15.7%, delivery makes up a certain percentage of that. So I just want to make sure if you guys understand the 15.7% it's not a delivery percent of sales, that's our total digital percent of sales. To go to your first question though, the breakdown between the various levers that drove comp, and I really think we just had a lot of things working in unison that we're building nicely on top of each other. You have the marketing, which I think was very visible with some smart menu innovation around these ideas of lifestyle goals. And then we've got very positive response to advertising, which I think reinforces why Chipotle is a different restaurant company there is real ingredients, real cooking techniques that brings food really fresh to you at tremendous speed and tremendous value. So I think that is coming through loud and clear. And we know that is a compelling message for people to be excited about being part of the Chipotle business. The other piece, obviously, is our digital business. As we continue to make access easier, so there's mobile pickup shelves giving to more restaurants, the digital make lines giving to more restaurants. We just execute that much better than we did the prior week. And what we're seeing is consumers love the app experience. They love the new website experience. And that's resulting in them committing, I think more and more to this easier access approach through the digital channel. Many layer in the idea of delivery, which our delivery times are usually below 30 minutes. And what we're hearing from folks is they love obtaining that new point of access as well. I think we're also one of the only companies out there that has delivery boat in our own app, and is using a third-party partner like a DoorDash or those that are delivering for us. And what we're seeing is no overlap between the two access points. So they're proving to be two different occasions and which is really terrific news. And we have built strong relationships with our partners where we're able to use data smartly to inform what we do next, as well as in the data reflecting internally. The other thing too is the rewards program got started. And one of the things that's terrific about the rewards program is we see another level of engagement into our digital system. So you see even more commitment to the idea of digital ordering, as well as all these additional access points. So the last thing too is I would tell you our operations. If you had a chance to be in Chipotle lately, I think they have really improved versus where we were three months ago, six months ago or even nine months ago. Our crews are staffed they know about how to make great food, they're doing line testings, the restaurants look great. And we're making progress on throughput. So when you think about all the initiatives that are going on, our operations, I think are operating at a higher level than they have in the past. I think our digital system is more robust than it was in the past. And I think our marketing is much more on point and much more visible. So it's hard to distinguish one versus the other. I really think it is all those things working in unison, and that's why we get that 9.9% comp. Operator : The next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Just a couple of questions on the sales trends. Jack first can you maybe talk about how the comps trended through the quarter? Was it a gradual build or any color you could add there would be helpful? Jack Hartung : So we started the quarter very strong. We had the free delivery bowls that continued into January. Then we had Lifestyle Bowls as well. There was a lot of talk about the Lifestyle Bowls. So the quarter started out very, very strong. We had weather then in the middle of the quarter, and then things rebounded near the end of the quarter. So there's a lot going on in the quarter. It was overall relatively steady if you factor out some of the weather. But we did start out -- like I said, we started out very strong and then settled into nice gains for the quarter with the exception of the weather during the middle of the quarter. David Tarantino : And then, Brian, you mentioned that the guest experience surveys that you run have responded well to the operational improvements you mentioned. So I was wondering if you could perhaps elaborate on where you are now on whatever metric you're measuring versus where you were three or six months ago. And how much you think that might be influencing the trends that you're seeing relative to some of the more tangible drivers you talked about? Brian Niccol : So one of the biggest things that we've seen make the dramatic change is just the feedback on the food testings. And I think that's a direct result of our teams being basically focused on ensuring they\u2019re creating great food and they are doing their line testings. And so one of the examples I'd give you is what we seen in customer satisfaction surveys is people are commenting on how great the food tastes again. And I think that is a testament to a couple of things. You don't end up with great food unless people make the food correctly. And you don't end up with great food if, when you sit down and go to eat your food that\u2019s not in a great environment. So all those things I think help build the idea that this food was terrific. The other thing that we're seeing in our customer satisfaction surveys are people just are getting us high marks on overall experience versus where we were in the past. So is a customer satisfaction survey is the best way for us to get that feedback, and we're very excited about the momentum we're seeing in those key metrics. David Tarantino : And then just a quick follow up. Brian, I know you shared some throughput metrics in the past related to your peak 15 minute intervals. And I think the last update you gave us was 25 transactions in the peak on average for the change, and it used to be 35 before all the issues. So can you maybe just give us an update on where you are heading into the peak season here on that metric? Brian Niccol : So I think I made comment in my early remarks. We're seeing some improvement on that mid 25, that mid 20s number. And we're excited about the improvement that we've seen. We're not I think done getting better on this throughput front. We're obviously not close to that mid 30 number that you referenced, David. But we're definitely making progress from the mid 20. And I think this is going to be one of those things that overtime we just continue to get better at. This is element of having teams in place with some stability with the right leader in place, so that they really get into a rhythm of great throughput. But early indications, we're making some progress on this front already. And we're excited because there's still so much headroom to get us back to where we were. Operator : The next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John Glass : First, can you just comment, Brian, little more about the loyalty program? How does this fit in as you think about comp drivers? And you talked last quarter about a material step up in trend when you did delivery and activated digital? Did it result or is it too early to tell if this is also resulting in another step function up in sales? Or does it taking longer to engage consumers given it take some time to clear the points? Brian Niccol : I think John it's going to take a little bit longer for us to see the direct impact. What we are excited about though is I think I said this in the past. One of the big request from our consumers was a rewards program. We've rolled out a rewards program and now we've already got 3 million people enrolled. And we're just getting started with using that information to then smartly market to those individuals. So there're few things that are going to be happening over the next year. We're going to continue to build that enrollment. And as you build that enrollment, it gives us a bigger universe then to create the right programs to incentivize behaviors and hopefully change behaviors associated with it. But I don't think we've seen the impacts yet from the rewards program, because we're just getting started with the enrollment and we're frankly just getting started with doing some targeted marketing leveraging that. John Glass : And if I could, just one follow up on labor, Jack. Is my calculation is labor dollars per store ran a bit higher than what you would call your wage inflation about 6% versus wage inflation of 4% to 5%. And if that's right, is this just the cost of higher throughput and higher volumes in your stores? Or is that the right way to think about labor dollars per store going forward if your conference are at this new higher run rate? Jack Hartung : John, our labor was really outstanding during the quarter. Our teams staff and deployed had about the right level. They certainly didn't have more hours than we would have expected of anything. They were a little more efficient than we would normally shoot for, but we had a burst in volume. So when you have that 9.9% and you should think about the comp as being at 10.3%, because that deferral means we had customers that came in they are paying customers and so it's a journal entry to take us from about a 10.2% or 10.3% down to a 9.9%. And so our folks had the right amount of labor. The way I would think about it, John, is we levered labor by over 100 basis points. We also dealt with about 100 basis points or a little more in terms of wage inflation. And so we had to cover the 100 basis points of wage inflation, and then we levered another 100 basis points. And we only had a modest price increase. So I think our labor is outstanding. And I think if we stay at these sales levels so we should stay at this labor level. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Bernstein : I just wanted to follow-up on the Chipotle Rewards Loyalty program, it seems like 3 million members is pleasing to you relative to perhaps your internal expectation. And I would assume you therefore have customer information now in these 3 millions. I'm wondering if you can go into a little more color in terms of how you'd measure ultimate success, whether how that membership compares to what you think that your total unique users? And Brian, you mentioned the one-to-one marketing. I\u2019m just wondering how we should think about that playing out in terms of using the data to effectively market to those loyal users? Brian Niccol : So I think that is one of the most valuable pieces of the rewards program is it creates a different type of engagement and relationship with our customers. What we saw in our proof of concept or our test markets is this data, when we turn it into communication, is able to incent behaviors. And we do see behavioral changes, so light user becoming a medium user, a non-user becoming a light user. And you see people moving the various cohorts. We\u2019re early days. We haven't even had for a lot of -- we have 3 million people, which we're delighted about but those are coming in on a daily basis. So we even had a chance to market with these folks on a couple months basis here, so it's really early. But I think the positive is we've got a lot of evidence that consumers want to be a part of it. And we've had evidence in our test markets that when we use the data smartly with them, we do see behavioral changes that results in a positive outcome for our sales group. Jeffrey Bernstein : And then just to clarify, you mentioned the digital sales being, I think you said just shy of 16%. But I know you mentioned that some stores obviously doing a whole lot better than that. So I'm wondering if you can maybe give some perspective in terms of the range across the country in terms of where you\u2019ve seen the greatest success and how you\u2019d measure the -- I guess the incrementality of those sales relative to more traditional sales? Brian Niccol : So we've seen where we've got the full digital system in place, definitely higher percent of sales going through the digital channels with higher sales in general. And I think we've even talked about this. Another example is the Chipotlane where you really have added another level of access, and this is why we're continuing to expand that test. We've seen percent of sales for digital touch 30%. So we're very optimistic that there still is a lot of growth to be had. And a lot of that growth is incremental to business. So we're very optimistic about continuing to drive this access point and ecosystem. Operator : The next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : I was hoping to understand the experience of the stores that have had the pickup shelves, and the digitally enhanced second make line the longest. Has there been a significant labor opportunity on a given number of transactions that can be realized in those stores versus other stores that have newly implemented those projects, or perhaps even best said, the stores that don't yet have those projects? Brian Niccol : I mean, what is definitely true is the most valuable transaction is an order ahead, whether it's in mobile or website, and then that consumer comes in and picks it up from the shelf, because obviously that leverage is then the digital make line, which requires less labor to run. And then, obviously, that transaction usually comes with a higher ticket as well. So that is the most valuable transaction for us to grow. One of the things I love about the Chipotlane test is it gives them more access to that highly valuable transaction, because they order ahead and now they don\u2019t have to even get out of their car to have an experience with a burrito bowl coming off our second make line. So there's a lot of upside in getting more and more business to that second make line just from an efficiency standpoint and then obviously the consumer just key at which they can get to their burrito bowl. John Ivankoe : And then secondly and I think this was touched on briefly. Some of the broader supply chain work that you've been working on. I mean if we could have an update on some timing and potential benefit on that, especially if you look into '20? Brian Niccol : So we're early days on this and we already started to see some benefit in the quarter. Their focus is obviously to continue to be as efficient as possible without making a trade off on the quality and our commitment to our integrity price goals. I don't know Jack if you wanted to add anything to that. Jack Hartung : John, I think the headline is it's too early. Brian is right that's our highest priority. We're also keeping ourselves busy just by keeping up with the growing volume. And we're seeing theoretical opportunities, efficiency opportunities, but they take time. We've got contracts. We've had a lot of suppliers. And so I would expect that we'll be able to -- if we don't see the benefit flow through later this year, perhaps in the fourth quarter, we'll at least have better visibility and we can tell you what those might look like going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Jake Bartlett with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Jake Bartlett : Jack, I have a question about G&A. And you gave us the underlying I think $72 million run rate continuing. I'm trying to understand the stock based comp. And I believe you mentioned $25 million, but that also included bonus accruals. I wasn't sure if that all was really the stock based comp. And then if you hit your guidance, if the current guidance is hit. Is that $25 million pertain for the rest of the year, because that\u2019s the right run rate for that, for bonus accruals and stock based camp. And then built into that question, there was a big impact on the tax rate with the $25 million. Would the tax rate go down as well to offset some of it? I'm trying to get a better idea of what the G&A could be for '19? Jack Hartung : Well, first of all, let me try to piece that -- tear that apart. The $25 million of that $19 million relates to our stock comp. And of that $19 million, about $2 million is an adjustment to stock comp, because we had better performance. We have, as we disclose in our proxy we, over the last couple of years, have emphasized more PSUs performance shares. Those performance shares will be marked each quarter based on how we actually perform. If you follow us historically when we've issued [indiscernible] as our option, those are fixed accounting and they don't change quarter-to-quarter, doesn't matter what our performance is, doesn't matter what the stock performance is. So it's a different animal that aligns better, we think the incentives with creating shareholder value. But it's going to have variable accounting and we're going to have drones entry that are going to happen throughout the year. The other 6 million relate to the higher bonus accrual, because of our performance. And that's going to be a cash bonus based on how we perform each quarter. And so if we continue to perform at this level, there will be higher bonus accruals. And then another element in there is that because our stock has performed so well, we've had an increase in the number of stock option exercises. And we have to pay payroll taxes on those, those are very difficult to predict when those are going to happen, also difficult to predict what the stock price is going to be. So there's going to be a number of things that are going to be not part of our core. The G&A this quarter didn't have to do with extra headcount, didn't have to do with extra travel, didn't have to do with anything from an ongoing basis that we need to continue to spend to support a restaurant. But these are incentive based things that are going to hit based on how we perform throughout the year. Difficult to predict exactly what the number will be, I think the best way to think about it. Underlying is about $72 million and underlying means that\u2019s our headcount to support our business, that's the travel, that's the outside services to support our business. There's a base layer, I would say, of about that $17 million stock comp that if we had fixed accounting that $17 million would not change throughout the year. And then on top of that, we're going to have amounts that will vary depending on our bonus accrual, and that will be performance based depending on the PSUs and that will be performance based on margins and what our stock comp is. And then to the extent that our folks exercise option, the stock price remains high, there may be some payroll tax impact as well. Jake Bartlett : And then you just secondly, Jack, you\u2019ve mentioned in the past, just your last call, a framework around AUVs and what AUVs could have a given restaurant level margin. I had trouble getting there. And so I'm just wondering when you talked about last call 2.2 million in AUVs and 22% restaurant margins. Is that still -- or does that include inflation going forward? Is that if you were standing right now with your current cost structure, and you have those higher AUVs that's what your margin would be? Trying to understand whether that's really how we can frame that target and mesh the two with those AUVs? Jack Hartung : Jake, it's more of a standing still. And in fact, we're right on the money right now. Our trailing 12 month average volume is 20% -- $0.5 million -- $2.05 million we're at 21% margin during this quarter. And what I've talked about is $2 million you\u2019re at about a 20% margin, $2.2 million you're at 22%. The way I would think about it from here, if we layered on $100,000 worth of incremental volume as of today, our margins at 21% during the quarter, would be -- that extra $100,000 would be a 22%. Now, over time inflation is going to have an impact there. We have to either offset inflation through modest price increases and/or leverage from higher sales. But as long as we're able to offset inflation over time, our model has the ability to expand margins at about 100 basis points to reach $100,000 of sales added. And I think probably the most important thing is we've been able to do this as our delivery business is growing dramatically, and we know the industry that's been a real challenge. We think we're uniquely suited with the second make line and efficiencies we drive with that second make line, and our model that inherently allows us to create leverage -- margin leverage as we grow sales. We're very optimistic that the more we add delivery sales to our business that margin has the ability to continue to drift upward. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles : Jack, I had a two part question for you. You called out projected year-two cash-on-cash returns and a low 40% range. Obviously, very stellar return. Do you think there's going to be a delta between the 2018 and 2019 cohort? That 2018 development skewed to some of the higher volume markets, or are you testing some the higher cost towards that in 2019? And then secondly is the low 40% returns, is that a strong enough hurdle to justify accelerating development back to call it the 250 openings per year you opened at the peak? Jack Hartung : First of all in terms of 2018 versus 2019, I mean it's early. It won't have 15 restaurants in so far. But I don't see any reason why 2019 performance wouldn't be similar to 2018. Meaning similar volumes, similar margins, similar returns. It does suggest that we have opportunity to step it up and open up more restaurants. We know that we're only halfway to our ultimate potential. We're about 2500 restaurants now with the ability to get to 5,000. So it suggests that we can step it up but we're going to do it the very thoughtful way. This is not going to be -- we're going to blow the doors off and go from -- our guidance this year is 141, 155, we're not going to all of a sudden open up two or 250 or something like that. What's most important is that we open at a pace that we're able to find great real estate that'll continue to generate these returns that we'll be able to hire, and develop and staff, our restaurants with great managers and great crew. So we'll have the right cadence going forward. But I do think you can expect us to take our opening guidance up each year in an incremental fashion. Too early to say how much that will be in 2020. But we're optimistic about the results and we'll step it up from here. Operator : Your next question comes from Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Gregory Francfort : The first question is G&A in a longer term basis? Maybe can you help frame up how you expect that to grow versus revenue? And then the second question just on the unit opening cadence within the year. I think last quarter you'd given us that the second quarter was going to be around 25% of openings for the year. Is that still the case or is it different from that? Jack Hartung : What was your first question? Gregory Francfort : I was just -- your G&A on a longer term and leveraging it versus revenue growth\u2026 Jack Hartung : The underlying G&A, and I have to emphasize underlying G&A. Underlying G&A will grow at a lesser rate than sales growth. That's our goal internally. And I know we can achieve that goal. From a stock comp standpoint, we're going to have journal entries. Remember, these are journal entries, and these journal entries are different today, because we have PSUs from the journal entries we would report three or four years ago when we had slow start. Even though we're issuing equity, even though there's solution related to this equity, the accounting treatment is dramatically different. And so it's important to understand that these journal entries that we're making, it doesn't change our cash flow, it doesn't change our cash and cash return but it does going to show up in our G&A through these accounting journal entries. The underlying G&A and that's the headcount, the travel, the outside services that we use to support our restaurants, we do plan to grow that at a lesser percent of sales. And then we're going to have cyclical things like we're going to have a quarter where there's a lot of option exercise and we're going to have a blip in payroll taxes. That's not a sustainable fundamental thing that will continue every single quarter. And we're going to have -- when we have great years like this or great quarter like this, you're going to have bonus accruals. But the idea there is that will be a match along with our improving out the economic model. And it really sets up sets us up for continued momentum, both in our sales, our margin, as well as EPS.  And then the second question was I think on opening. I think I mentioned in my comments, Q2 will open up at a little bit more than the 15 that we opened up in the first quarter. So this is going to be one of those years where we're pretty more heavily loaded in the second half of the year than we've been in quite some time. Operator : The next question comes from Will Slabaugh with Stephens. Please go ahead. Will Slabaugh : I had a question on menu innovation. And what we've seen in the past is when menu innovation that generally uses ingredients already in store. Should we expect future menu innovation rather to mostly take that same form, or is there room to broaden SKUs in the restaurant at this point? Brian Niccol : Yes, you're going to see us doing both. Obviously, what we did in the first quarter was leverage existing ingredients that were already on the line. But I think I've mentioned this before, we're using our stage-gate process to evaluate either new ingredients and/or new forms to bring into the restaurant. And one of our key criteria in order to bring in a new form or an all new ingredient is it can't have an impact on throughput. So the consumers going to love it, it's got to work financially but it also has to work for our operating process. And so as a result, it's going to take a little longer time to bring things to market that are either a change in process or require new equipment or a new form versus it's much easier to do things like a new ingredient or introduce people to a new way, or a new Lifestyle Bowl, like we did in the first quarter. But the plan is to do both. Operator : The next question comes from Howard Penny with Hedgeye. Please go ahead. Howard Penny : My questions on delivery. Is Georgia's funding part of the delivery or are you funding all of the delivery costs? And if you are given all the benefits that you're seeing from delivery from a margin perspective and enhance capability of delivery. Why wouldn't you offer delivery free all the time and if not all the time, three or four days a week? Thanks. Brian Niccol : So, obviously, delivery is one of those access modes that consumers definitely want to experience. This is a scenario where we want to set up the model to be a model that can work long-term, not just here in the near term. And long term, we can just be planning to do free delivery all the time. So really what we're focused on is, how do we build the right economic model where the consumer gets a great experience, they get a great value and as a result, they want to do it more. And I think that's what we're setting up and establishing with our key partners, whether they are doing it through our app or through a third-party. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer and Company. Please go ahead. Brian Bittner : Jack, you said labor costs in 2Q should be in the low 26% range. And that would suggest a similar amount of leverage that you got in first quarter. So just trying to clarify. Are you assuming a similar sales trend in 2Q as 1Q when you talk about that labor guide? And second to that the full year guidance for labor, back when you talked to us last quarter, was low 27% range. But you didn't really update that this quarter for the full year. Where's that target now in your mind for full year labor costs? Jack Hartung : When I think about Q2, I would not expect the same comp. Take into account by the full year guidance that we gave and take into account that comps get tougher each quarter. What it does mean though is seasonally our sales are higher in the second quarter. So when you move from Q1 to Q2, you naturally have a higher sales amount and you naturally have a leverage, just from moving to seasonally higher sales. It doesn't mean the comp is going to be at the same 9.9% level. The other thing I would expect that labor for the year is going to be somewhere in between these two levels. I mean, you got 26.7% in the first quarter. Fourth quarter seasonally is very similar. And the two quarters in the middle should be similar where you're in that low 26% range. So I think somewhere between the low 26% to the 26.7% we just delivered, I think that's a fair estimation of where labor should fall. And what we shown in this quarter, we have labor at that level. And as long as we don't have as long as things like avocados normalize we could deliver this strong comp in the 20%, 21% range or so. Operator : And the next question comes from Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Brian Vaccaro : Just two quick ones on delivery, if I could. Would you be willing to ballpark what percent of digital sales is coming from delivery? And also curious what percent of orders are coming through the company app versus the DoorDash or other third party platforms? And did that move much since the launch of the loyalty program over the five or six weeks? Brian Niccol : We're not going to break out the composition of our digital sales but with obviously to be up 100% year-over-year. We're seeing great progress in all aspects of the digital system, whether it's order ahead delivery. Consumers continue to want to have access digitally and then they want to have access where it's either brought to them or they can get it quick. So that's working very nicely. And then adding rewards, I think I mentioned this before. One of the things that's great about the rewards program is it's another level of engagement in this digital system. And we have continued to see when people become engaged in the rewards program, they become even more engaged in our digital system. And you see an uptick in our digital as a percent of sales as well there. So it really requires all these things to be working in unison. We got to have the pickup shelves, which I'm happy to say we now have that have in other restaurants, the digital make line, which we're in 1,300 rec up there we'll be finishing that up in 2019. And then the rewards program is in the early days as well where we've got 3 million people already engaged. And then we're giving them the access that they want, whether we're testing our Chipotlanes or letting DoorDash or a third party like that deliver to them at their home. So the digital system is a powerful growth driver for the company going forward. And it's consistent with the strategy that I've shared with you guys. So we're really excited about the early innings of all this stuff. Brian Vaccaro : And then shift into the commodity outlet, Jack, the 33% that you gave for the year. I'm just curious, what's the underlying inflation embedded in that forecast? And just are you assuming that avocados stay where they are currently after this recent run up? Or any other puts and takes on what you're seeing on core proteins and/or other areas that we should be mindful of? Thank you. Jack Hartung : We're seeing just a little bit of inflation in some of our [indiscernible]. Most of the commodities that we're looking at look pretty benign. The real story the only call out is significant call out is avocados. We're paying a lot more right now. That's why second quarter food costs going to be about 100 basis points more. We'll update you when we update you for the second quarter, hopefully that will ease a little bit as you move into the third quarter. We do expect it to go back to normal once we move back to away from California in the fourth quarter. But avocados are a tough thing to predict. Other than avocados, most other things are pretty modest, very low single digit inflation. And so that's why we think we can stay in this 33% range overall for the year. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Brian Niccol : All right, thank you. And thank you everybody for taking the time and the questions. I just wanted to remind folks, I think the strategies that we outlined over a year ago, we're starting to see the impacts of the execution around that strategy, whether it is making the brand more visible with culturally relevant marketing and menu innovation, or making the restaurant experience more digital with the roll out of our mobile pickup shelves, the digital make line, the delivery partnerships and now the rewards program, to operational improvements focused on great hospitality, great food, a great environment and then ultimately, terrific throughput. And then obviously, we're going to continue to work hard to improve this economic model, which is I think one of the best in the industry through being smart and being efficient and prudent in how we choose to spend our money. And then the key piece too is we want to continue to drive home access for Chipotle, whether that means physical access to more restaurants, more digital access through the various channels that I\u2019ve talked about earlier. But we want to have Chipotle solve people's needs for how they want to eat in today and in the future. So very proud of the team and the results that we achieved in Q1, and very excited that we continued down this strategy, and continue to execute with excellence going forward. So thank you for your time. And we'll talk to you all soon. Take care. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Ashish Kohli, Head of Investor Relations. Ashish Kohli : Hello, everyone and apologies for the delayed opening. Welcome to our second quarter 2019 earnings call. By now you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. Including projections about comparable restaurant sales growth, new store openings, our effective tax rate and expected G&A expenses. These statements are based on management\u2019s current business and market expectations and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our annual \u2013 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these measures to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today\u2019s call prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer. After which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Niccol : Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. We\u2019re pleased with our second quarter financial performance which reflects continued progress on the strategic initiatives we discussed at our special Investor Call just over a year ago. Since that time, our efforts to highlight that Chipotle sources, cooks and serves real food that has the power to cultivate a better world have led to a meaningful improvement in our business fundamentals. In fact, this marks the sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating comparable sales, which reinforces our view that when we connect with guests through culturally relevant marketing focused on Chipotle\u2019s great taste and real ingredients and provide more convenient access with less friction, they respond. For the quarter, we reported 10% comparable restaurant sales growth that included nearly 7% transaction growth, restaurant level margins of 20.9% which is 120 basis points higher than last year, earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $3.99 representing 39% year-over-year growth and digital sales growth of 99% year-over-year representing 18.2% of sales. These strong results were delivered despite the tougher year-over-year comparison and benefited from better execution, on four key initiatives we mentioned on last year\u2019s call, specifically revamping our marketing, creating a stage-gate process for innovations, leveraging our second make line to grow digital sales and expand access and engaging with our customers by launching a new loyalty program. All of these efforts are layered on top of our foundational work to run successful restaurants with great hospitality and throughput. Let me now spend a few minutes updating you on each of these initiatives. First, starting with our marketing efforts. We made sure to stay relevant throughout the quarter by celebrating our real ingredients and classic cooking techniques. Our Behind The Foil campaign resonated with guests by showcasing the connection between how food is raised and prepared to how it taste by featuring our team members pride in making delicious food daily. In addition, Q2 benefited from several strategic promotions that made the Chipotle brand more visible for helping to expand access. An example is a free delivery promotion in conjunction with the prominent influencer to celebrate National Burrito Day on April 4. Leveraging the social and digital experience helped make this, the highest sales day in Chipotle\u2019s history. More importantly, it was another opportunity to acquire customers and transactions by introducing them for the convenience of delivery and we are seeing increased new customer retention with higher levels of delivery sales after the promotion. On the menu side, we are elevating our core by developing innovations that leads food culture and meet guests requests. Our Lifestyle Bowls remain popular with customers and we continue to test new menu items that are in various stages of development. The furthest along is Carne Asada, which I am pleased to announce is nearing validation through our stage-gate process, after which we will decide on the timing of a potential national launch. This item is easy to execute operationally as unique flavor profile and is receiving terrific customer feedback in our test markets. We are also gaining valuable feedback on our Quesadilla pilot with the good news being that customers really love it. The new ovens are helping to improve the quality and taste of the Quesadillas and could potentially be a platform for other new menu items including desserts and nachos. That being said, we still have some work to do in order to streamline our workflow. As I\u2019ve stated previously, we are not going to roll out new menu items at the sacrificed throughput. We will update you on our progress of all potential new menu items as they move through our stage-gate process. We are very excited about Chipotle rewards which launched on March 12 and has exceeded our expectations with over five million enrolled members. Encouragingly these sign-ups across all frequency bands, and we are starting to use customer data to more effectively target and engage the incidence of lower frequency in lapsed users. Early results are showing that members are increasing their frequency after joining the program. The rewards program gives us a currency that we can use to incent behaviors and is a key enabler of our digital ecosystem moving forward. Our customers are responding positively to our digital system, which includes order ahead, delivery and catering as it reduces friction and creates a convenient and enjoyable way for our guests to experience Chipotle. Overall, digital sales grew 99% year-over-year to $262 million during the quarter and represented 18.2% of sales. For this in perspective, this was more than we did in digital sales during all of 2016. Delivery remains a key driver of our digital growth given enhanced capabilities on our app and website, as well as our expanded reach. In fact, delivery is now available for more than 95% of our restaurants and remains highly incremental. We continue to see residual lift in delivery sales that last beyond any promotion and have seen very little guest overlap between our own in-app delivery and our third-party delivery partner apps. Additionally with mobile order pickup shelves available in all relevant restaurants and digital make lines in nearly 2,000 restaurants, we are modernizing and making the customer and team member experience, more efficient, while building more love for Chipotle. With more customers coming to Chipotle restaurants, many of whom are new, it is imperative we provide a great guest experience. The operations team has made progress against this goal, partly as a result of our focus to make 2019 the year of the General Manager. Specifically, we have a great company with a meaningful purpose that people want to be a part of. We have a culture of food safety. We are dedicated to training and developing talent and we are enhancing our industry-leading employee benefits. In addition to our newly expanded tuition assistance program you may have seen our recent announcement of a new crew bonus program. This gives hourly employees the opportunity to turn up to an extra month\u2019s pay each year based on the restaurant achieving certain performance in food safety goals. This is another example of investing in our most valuable asset, our people. As a result of these efforts, we believe our employee value proposition is resonating. Manager and crew turnover have come down nicely over the past year. Our food is being prepared more consistently through line tastings and our result is being executed better. And we are seeing steady improvement in throughput aided by training, focus and providing our teams with an easy to use dashboard, that provides greater visibility on performance. While I am encouraged by the progress thus far, I believe we still have a significant opportunity for further throughput gains. When done well throughput isn\u2019t simply about moving people through the restaurant as quickly as possible, instead, it\u2019s about outstanding customer service with clear authentic communication as customers efficiently move down our serving line. I believe better execution on our five key pillars, which have historically been proven throughput drivers will drive sales and transactions. Everyone at Chipotle believes real food can change the world. So we strive every day to do the right thing for our employees, for our customers and for the environment. I would like to personally thank each of our team members for their tireless dedication and passion to make Chipotle success. In closing, what really excites me is that I believe we are still in the early stages on many of our key initiatives and by continuing to execute and get better which we are committed to doing, Chipotle is well positioned for future growth. With that, here\u2019s Jack to walk you through the financials. Jack Hartung : Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We\u2019re proud of our performance for the first half of 2019 as we continue to see comps and margins expand. Combination of investing in our people, delivering relevant and compelling marketing, and enhanced digital system and great execution in our restaurants is all leading to a better guest dining experience, which ultimately allows us to further strengthen our economic model. Sales were $1.4 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 13.2% from last year. The comp was 10% in the quarter, which includes a 40 basis point reduction as a result of deferred revenue from our rewards program. Restaurant level margins of 20.9% expanded 120 basis points over last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $3.99 representing 39% year-over-year growth. The second quarter had unusual expenses related to our transformation as well as legal reserves, which I\u2019ll talk about in more detail later and these negatively impacted our earnings per share by about $0.77 leading to GAAP earnings per share of $3.22. Our Q2 comp of 10% was driven by healthy acceleration in transactions as nearly 7% of the comp came from greater guest visits. The higher average check includes a price impact of about 2% and a mix contribution of roughly 1.5% driven by growth in digital orders which have a higher average check. We\u2019re delighted by the customer response to the convenience offered by our digital strategies as well as the culturally relevant marketing which once again drove increased guest visits into our restaurant. Given the strong Q2 and first half of 2019 results, we\u2019re increasing our full year comp guidance from mid to high single digits. To the high single digits with price continuing contribute about 2%. And as you think about the cadence for the remaining two quarters, remember that our comparisons get more difficult as the year unfolds. We opened 20 new restaurants in the quarter, with continued strong economics. For 2019, we expect to open between 140 and 155 new restaurants with the weighting that\u2019s heavily skewed toward the fourth quarter. We anticipate Q3 opening to be slightly higher than what we saw in Q2 with Q4 openings increasing significantly. Based on the site pipeline we\u2019re building so far this year, we expect the 2020 new restaurant openings to be more equally weighted by quarter. Food cost for the quarter were 33.7%, an increase of 110 basis points from last year due primarily to higher avocado prices partially offset by a menu price increase, while we anticipated some of the avocado price increase due to a spike in late March based on higher demand from retailers, prices spiked again in June going to further reduce supply coming from Mexico. This resulted in a roughly 50 basis point greater headwind from avocados during the quarter than we expected. Avocado prices are likely to remain elevated in July, but should start to moderate as we move through the quarter as our sourcing shifts to other market. Offsetting some of the avocado pressure in Q2 was approximately $2 million of cost savings through more efficient sourcing, while our supply chain team will continue to search for efficiencies, our top priority is to continue to pursue high quality, sustainably raise ingredients and our pursuit of efficiencies will never be at the expense of food quality or food safety. Of note, protein pricing was in line with our expectations during the quarter and we\u2019ve not seen any impact for market forces thus far. Since we purchased higher quality more expensive pork as opposed to commodity pork, and we have pricing agreements in place, covering the near term, we don\u2019t expect a significant impact on our costs for the rest of this year. Factoring in the above items, we expect Q3 cost of sales to be slightly lower than Q2, while Q4 should be at or slightly below 33% of sales. Labor costs for the quarter were 25.7%, a decrease of 130 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage, partially offset by labor inflation which continues to be in the 4% to 5% range. We expect Q3 labor costs to be in the mid-26% range as we expect similar labor inflation against lower sales seasonality. Other operating costs for the quarter were 13.5%, a decrease of 30 basis points from Q2 last year, as sales leverage more than offset higher marketing and promo costs. Marketing promo costs were 3.3% in the quarter, an increase of about 10 basis points compared to Q2 of last year to fund our Behind the Foil campaign and various delivery promotions. We expect our marketing investment to be spent more evenly over the second half of the year, with the marketing and promo budget for the full year remaining around 3% of sales. Other operating costs continue to include delivery fees. And delivery is the way for us to increase convenience, drive awareness and ultimately acquire new customers. It remains the fastest growing part of our business with a relatively small portion being associated with free delivery promotions. Given the high incrementality we\u2019re currently seeing, delivery continues to be accretive to our restaurant level margins. G&A for the quarter was $121 million on a GAAP basis or $97 million on a non-GAAP basis which excludes $4 million related to transformation expenses and $20 million for legal reserves. G&A also includes $20 million related to non-cash stock compensation and $4 million related to higher bonus accruals from our strong performance and payroll taxes and stock option exercises. Similar to last quarter, without these items, our underlying G&A this quarter, restaurants total right around $72 million, which is in line with our expectations. Moving forward, we expect our underlying G&A support to increase by about $2 million to $3 million in Q3 as we round out our organizational structure. Assuming our current financial trends continue, I would expect stock compensation, including performance adjustments and higher bonus expenses to remain right around this $25 million for both Q3 and Q4. As it relates to legal reserves, we recorded $20 million in the quarter for estimated loss contingencies related to legal proceedings much of which relates to older cases and includes the previously disclosed government investigation that\u2019s been going on for about four years now \u2013 nearly four years. We have a new General Counsel and legal team, we\u2019re taking a determined approach to resolving certain outstanding matters with the objective of putting these specific issues behind us wherever appropriate. But we still have work to do to bring final resolution of these matters, we believe this reserve is a reasonable estimate based on where we are today. And we\u2019ll update you as we have more information. Continuing down the income statement, our effective tax rate was 26.6% on a GAAP basis and 23.9% on a non-GAAP basis. Included in both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate is the recognition of excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation. The GAAP tax rate is higher because of the possible non-deductibility of some of the legal reserves. For the remainder of 2019, we expect our underlying effective tax rate to be in the 26% to 29% range. So it may vary quarter-to-quarter based on discrete items. Our balance sheet remained strong with cash and investments totaling about $746 million. As of June 30, we\u2019ve repurchased $58 million of our stock at an average price of $703 per share during the quarter. Similar to last quarter, even though there are fewer shares outstanding and trading as a result of these purchases, our diluted weighted average share has actually increased by 182,000 shares from Q1 as a result of more options being in the money given higher share price. In closing, we\u2019re encouraged by our Q2 results and the progress we\u2019re making against our strategic growth initiatives that relate out about a year ago. Sustaining our sales momentum is the most important lever to our powerful economic model and that requires great execution and delivering an excellent guest experience. We\u2019re grateful to all of our team members for their hard work and their commitment and contributing to our vision of cultivating a better world. And now we\u2019re happy to take your questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we will now being the question-and-session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from David Tarantino from Baird. Please go ahead with your question. David Tarantino : Hi, good afternoon and congratulations on a strong first half of the year. And Brian, you mentioned being in the early stages of a lot of the initiatives, and I guess the context of my question is related to the momentum you\u2019ve seen in the first half of the year. And I guess that won\u2019t be long before investors start worrying about your ability to cycle such big numbers as you move into next year and even the following year. So, I guess can you talk about how you think about the business recovering over the next year \u2013 to as you cycle these big numbers and how as you layer in what you have in the initiative pipeline, your degree of confidence and sustaining such positive comp momentum. Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. Thanks, David. So yes, my point on why we\u2019re in the early stages of all these initiatives is very simple. We just launched a rewards program in March. We\u2019ve got five million members in there. This is a place that we\u2019re going to grow from. We\u2019re not done adding members to the rewards program. As you think about the digital ecosystem, we first started with installing digital make lines and we layered in the digital pickup shelves. So it will be even easier for the customer and then we layered in the rewards program. And if you think about the awareness of this total system for our customers, we\u2019re still in the early days of those levels of awareness and utilization. So, I think there is opportunities to grow from where we are today on that front. And then as you think about really kind of revamping our marketing communication allocating those marketing dollars, you\u2019re really just now starting to see the marketing team utilized new communication vehicles and continue to fine tune the communication as it relates to Chipotle\u2019s real ingredients, real cooking, which results and we think really the best food out there. And then the last piece is some of the innovation that we\u2019ve been working on our stage-gate process, all those things are still in its early days and in most cases, the only thing we brought out really is the Lifestyle Bowls to date. And then I\u2019d be remiss not to talk about all the great progress we\u2019re making on operations. If you think about where we were six months ago, a year ago or even two years ago, we are far better than we were. And I\u2019m confident that team is focused on the right things to be better, six months from now, 12 months from now, two years from now. So, still very much early days. We\u2019re delighted to see the response that we\u2019re getting to the digital system. The response that we\u2019re getting, I would say better operations with more consistent better tasting food that now is getting to be a bit faster. And then we\u2019re very optimistic about how we can grow from here. We had this reward system and also the future as it relates to innovations, as it relates to the menu and or how the market. So delighted to see the response to date, but this is just the beginning. This is how I would categorize it. David Tarantino : Sounds good. And on the rewards program, can you elaborate on what you learn to date in terms of your ability to change behavior with that program or incentive behavior with that program. I think I\u2019m a member of the program. And I don\u2019t even recall seeing any incentives throughout the quarter. So just wondering how you\u2019re using that and what you\u2019re learning so far. Brian Niccol : Well, we have you blocked, David. But\u2026 David Tarantino : That\u2019s [indiscernible]. No, I\u2019m just kidding. Totally kidding. Brian Niccol : Yes. So, look we are early days in this and we obviously are breaking this up into various cohorts and we\u2019re trying to experiment with each of those cohorts to understand if you, incentivize them with points on certain days of the week or certain add-ons, what type of behavioral changes do we see. And the good news is, we\u2019ve done a couple. We\u2019ve not done a whole lot and the thing to keep in mind is you know last quarter where were we, I think two million, three million people. This quarter, now we\u2019re closing on five million. So we\u2019re still refining the cohorts and then we\u2019re also experimenting with each of these cohorts to understand how that impacts their behavior. With that all said, the few programs that we run, we\u2019ve been really pleased with our ability to influence behavior going forward. So as the population gets bigger in the rewards program and we get more fine-tuned on our cohorts, our goal is to then further drive behaviors that makes sense for the customer and then also makes sense for the Chipotle proposition. So early days, but we\u2019re very pleased with where we are right now. David Tarantino : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question. David Palmer : Thanks. Just a couple of quick questions on digital. It looks like your mix was up eight points from the prior year. How much do you think this mix increase is driving comps or how incremental you think it is? And over the next year, how do you think specifically I guess it relates to Tarantino\u2019s question, but how much do you think this digital lift can continue? And just thinking about this digital mix was up 2.5 points from the previous quarter, so it looks like that digital lift is increasing or accelerating, but of course we have more difficult comparisons as you think about things like loyalty coming up. So, any thoughts on that? Thanks. Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So look, we continued to understand all the \u2013 facets of how this digital business is coming to life. Right as it relates to order ahead, delivery and rewards. And then we also have about 16 restaurants now with Chipotlane where we\u2019ve added another access point for people that order ahead. And what I\u2019m delighted about is we see places where you\u2019re seeing the digital business achieved 30% and north of 30% and it is driven by just giving people more access building more awareness and giving them great experiences. So we definitely are not, we think, at the top of where this is. We think there is still, lots of room for growth in all aspects of the digital business, our catering business continues to still be a relatively small piece of the order ahead business and we think there\u2019s tremendous opportunity on that front as well. So as we continue to build awareness, give people more access and get them to understand the occasions that they can use this access for, we\u2019ve been pleased to see where this business can get too and we\u2019ve got some evidence of getting north of 30%. David Palmer : And do you think that, are you thinking about how much of that eight point mix is really adding to the comps you\u2019re seeing lately? Brian Niccol : You mean the 18%? David Palmer : Well the eight point increase or its 18% this quarter, but year-ago. Brian Niccol : Versus year ago, versus the 10%you\u2019re talking about. David Palmer : Yes. How you think about it? Brian Niccol : Yes. So the good news is, as we\u2019ve talked about it, the component of this is delivery, which is highly incremental that\u2019s in the 70% range. I think is what we\u2019ve shared and what we continue to see and it appears to be pretty consistent with other people see. Our order ahead business not as incremental as our delivery business, but we\u2019re still continuing to see it be a very incremental piece on the business as well. So we\u2019re not breaking out exactly the contribution relative to the comp, but what I can tell you is, it continues to be an incremental piece of the business and it comes with a nice flow-through as well. So we love incrementally profitable transactions and that\u2019s what this digital business brings to the Chipotle business. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead with your question. Nicole Miller : Thank you. Good afternoon. Two quick questions. The first is on marketing. So the 3% spend is relatively static year-over-year but dollars are up. So, I imagine impressions, weeks et cetera. The dollar spend is up. The question is fairly simple in that, the dollars are up and comps are up. So, what\u2019s the thought process behind increasing marketing spend above 3%? And depending on how you define your peer group, that could be another 100 basis point to fall in line with your peer group. Thanks. Brian Niccol : Sure. So, I think obviously, this quarter, the spend was up. A part \u2013 a big reason for that is Chris and his team, I think, are smart about allocating our marketing dollars. Two communication vehicles that are going to be highly effective and there was more options available in this quarter for us to get the Chipotle message in front of our customers at the right time. And fortunately, we had the right communication there. The thing I will tell you is we are always evaluating whether or not we have the right spend and what we see today is we feel really good about the absolute dollars that we\u2019re spending and I think really what you\u2019re seeing more than anything else is the allocation of those dollars resulting in the brand being more visible with the right communication at the right time, which then is driving ultimately a purchase at Chipotle. So, no plans in the near-term to go beyond that 3%. The other thing to keep in mind too Nicole is, as this business grows, the marketing budget grows with it, because it\u2019s 3% of now a much bigger business than it was six months a year ago and the marketing team is going to be really smart about how they allocate those additional dollars going forward, so that the brand continues to even being more visible and even more effective in its communication. So, really proud of the work that team has done. But I think we\u2019re still getting started on this one as well and there\u2019s a lot of creative things to come with the dollars that have been allocated to marketing today. Nicole Miller : That\u2019s very helpful. I think what gets lost in the shuffle, can you \u2013 the comp is there is really just not much in a 3% of the spend and that would be one way if you ever wanted to look way out in the future to do it. So, that\u2019s very helpful. The second question is around your comments on digital and some stores being 30% mix, it\u2019d be pretty fascinating to understand anything you could share, this might not be the right metric, but the first thing that comes to mind is the AUV range. So, I\u2019m trying to understand clearly with the comp being what it is and the flow through. I don\u2019t think there is any question that it\u2019s incremental. So, would you characterize the AUV of those digital, high use digital stores as passed the system average maybe there higher at above the system or maybe there even at like what a prior peak used to be for the system. What does that look like? Brian Niccol : Yes, what I can definitely share with you is they\u2019re above our average for sure. And I don\u2019t think we want to get into specifically talking about what the AUVs are, because some of that relates to the site-specific, but what I can definitely share with you is where the digital system is totally in place, meaning even adding a Chipotlane that\u2019s beyond the average unit volumes. And then even in the places without Chipotlane is above and beyond our average unit volumes, where you see this digital business play such a big percentage of the business. So, we feel great about continuing to drive that digital business to a higher percent. Because it is incremental, which then results in these higher average unit volumes that we\u2019re seeing across our system. Nicole Miller : Thank you for the time. Operator : And our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please go ahead with your question. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good afternoon. I just have to say I did get an incentive through rewards. So, I\u2019m pleased to be in a different cohort than David. So\u2026 Brian Niccol : You know what that means. That means that you are a light user. Sharon Zackfia : I think, currently, he is going to block me as we\u2019re talking. So, on the delivery side of the equation. I guess just given the success you\u2019ve had with DoorDash and it sounds like very little overlap between what DoorDash is doing and what you\u2019re getting through your own app. I mean how do you think about opening that opportunity to other third-party delivery providers. Is that something you\u2019re exploring? And then it seems as if the digital cadence didn\u2019t slow at all after you lap the DoorDash agreement in May. And if you could just talk about, if that was in fact the case that maintained its momentum. Brian Niccol : Yes. So, to answer your first question. We\u2019ve got a great relationship with DoorDash. We do today also provide delivery with Postmates and Tapingo. So, it\u2019s not exclusive however DoorDash and Chipotle, I think have done a nice job of marketing the delivery channel. And we\u2019ve got a great relationship in place with that team. And as you mentioned, we lapse our DoorDash partnership pretty successfully. And one of the things that I\u2019m really excited about seeing is, it does continue to show up in the data that those that use our in app delivery experience are not the same people that are using the third-party app experience. The other thing that I\u2019m also really excited about is there are a lot of people on these third-party platforms that still have not gotten to try Chipotle delivery. Even though Chipotle is one of their top delivery partners, there is lots of runway with people that are using these aggregator sites to still have an opportunity to experience the Chipotle delivery experience. So, lots of runway, even in the partnerships we have in place. And then as I think about our digital business as it grows and we generate more awareness about the occasion, I\u2019m very optimistic about how we grow from here going forward. Sharon Zackfia : Okay. Thank you. Brian Niccol : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question. Sara Senatore : Great. Thank you. I had a question about the product launches, and then a follow-up on the digital mix. Just on the \u2013 you were talking about Carne Asada being well received and looking to Quesadilla as \u2013 getting the ops right there. I mean, I think in \u2013 my question has to do with, is the goal to sort of prevent menu fatigue, is it to bring in new customers. Is it to drive incrementality in a \u2013 the given quarter that you launch it. Is there anything you can tell us about to the extent that you\u2019re seeing successful test? How that\u2019s translating into new or incremental traffic? And how do you think about that in the context of, I think people in general are creatures of habit and a lot of people probably order the same things over and over again anyway. So, any color on that? And then like I said, I have a follow-up on the digital mix. Brian Niccol : Sure. So, to answer your question on the menu innovation, we view it as \u2013 it should be able to drive incremental sales transactions. The reason why is because it does give people an experience that they don\u2019t get out of their every day experience. So, it gives them a reason to either come more often or maybe come and try us for the first time. And as we do these tests, that\u2019s what we\u2019re really trying to understand. How much of this is, hey, this is just among our existing user that\u2019s coming more often, because we\u2019ve now added another occasion form. Or you know what we\u2019ve now peak somebody\u2019s interest that has never had the opportunity to try Chipotle in the past. And Carne Asada is a great example, where we\u2019ve actually gotten the request of both non-users of Chipotle and users of Chipotle to say, how can you guys never do Carne Asada? Now whether or not, it stays on the menu permanently. there\u2019s a lot of things that go into that decision. And that\u2019s why we keep these things into our test long enough, so that we can understand how is it perfect behave both new with marketing and then just on a sustained basis as part of the menu. And then things like the Quesadilla, it adds another level of validation, because it cannot have a negative impact on our throughput. But things like Quesadillas and Nachos; those are clearly things that both, again, users and non-users of Chipotle have said, well that would really make the brand, the restaurant experience even more attractive, so that I could come more often. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re experimenting with these things. And that\u2019s why we use the stage-gate process. So, we can understand that balancing act between incrementality among existing users as well as bringing in new users. Sara Senatore : Great. Thank you. And then just on the \u2013 I know you said you\u2019re not breaking out the contribution, the comp from the different types of digital ordering. But is it fair to assume that at least some of the growth came from mobile order and pay. The reason I ask is, because of one, the extent to which, when you see people actually coming into the store, maybe, that\u2019s an opportunity to engage with them and versus delivery. And then two, of course, I think they are very different margin profiles, insofar as mobile order and pay I think is probably the highest margin and delivery is lower. So, if you could just maybe talk about that either even qualitatively, the mobile order and pay versus the delivery? Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So, yes, obviously, it contributed to our comp growth, right. I mean the thing that\u2019s wonderful about this digital business is its incremental transactions with higher ticket. So, we\u2019re picking up more ticket and that is true, both in the order ahead business as well as the delivery business. Now, obviously, the order ahead business has even better economics, because we don\u2019t have to deal with the aspect of the delivery cost. But both are proving to be incremental, both are contributing to the comp and we\u2019re very bullish on how we can drive this going forward. Sara Senatore : Okay. Thank you. Brian Niccol : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. John Glass : Thanks very much. Brian, as you look at your digital mix across your fleet of stores, how \u2013 is it a normal distribution? Is it more skewed as you might think to more urban markets, more affluent markets? Or is it really across the breadth of your stores? And I guess the comment is on digital, but also in delivery specifically, how evenly distributed or not, is that business for you? Brian Niccol : Yes. You know what \u2013 it\u2019s actually fairly evenly distributed. You don\u2019t have certain spikes in some of those areas that you mentioned, it\u2019s fairly evenly distributed, John. John Glass : That\u2019s helpful. Can you talk about also throughput, maybe update us on the metrics you\u2019re looking at for throughput. You said there is \u2013 it\u2019s improving, but there is still opportunity. And in particular, the digital make line is accounting for, and I\u2019m rounding up nearly 20% of your sales, is that executing as you would expect? Or do you need to tweak that as the volumes are growing faster there? Maybe, one time expected and you need more capacity there? Or is it \u2013 is it still underutilized in this headroom? Brian Niccol : Yes. So, the \u2013 first, I\u2019ll answer the question, just in general on throughput. The teams have made really great progress on throughput. We are halfway through the year. I think we mentioned in our prior call that we have \u2013 the teams are incentivized in their bonus based on throughput targets and then even to the point now where we will provide accrued bonus assuming they\u2019re able to hit there both throughput targets, food safety targets and the other key operating metrics that we ask the team to hit. but I think the thing that\u2019s really been powerful is Scott has got the operational organization just focused on a critical few items. It\u2019s these tasks have a great team \u2013 have a great leader, which results in great culture. That\u2019s number one. He has got them focused on. Number two. Great food, taste the food, know how to make the food and do it right, every single time. Throughput, we now have the dashboard in place, we\u2019re showing the teams what is the difference between having the five pillars in place versus not having the five pillars in place and we\u2019re seeing nice results on that front. And then obviously, a culture of food safety has to be evident in everything that we do, since we\u2019re handling real ingredients with real cooking techniques every single day. So, all of it is working together and I give Scott and a lot of our ATDs a lot of credit, because they are really getting after one best way of execution and then holding themselves accountable against that execution. So, I think we\u2019re going to continue to see better progress on operations going forward. And we look at this every day and you know this, the restaurant business, the retail business is an everyday business. And that\u2019s the type of focus that we have. Every day, we want to be better than we were the day before. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re getting after on the throughput, team stability, great food and then obviously, all in a food safe environment. So, on your question regarding the digital make line, the good news is, we have plenty of capacity. Capacity is not our issue. If anything, we just have to learn how to execute better on that second make line. Some new metrics are important for us, right. On the front line, we\u2019ve never had to worry about accuracy. Because the reality is, I\u2019m interacting with you and you get exactly what you want as you move down the line. Now, we\u2019ve moved to a place, where you order, you pick it up and go, and then you open it up, and that\u2019s the moment of truth of whether or not it\u2019s accurate, everything is there, is it hot? And the good news is, the food is hot, because we make it really quick. The deliveries are really fast. And we\u2019re learning our way to become even more accurate. So, some things that we\u2019re learning, so that we could be better with that off-premise experience. But all in all, plenty of capacity, customers really love having the additional access, both on-premise and off-premise. And then as I mentioned, I think the in-store operation is just really, really continuing to improve and much better than we were six months ago or even a year ago. John Glass : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Andy Barish from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Andy Barish : Hey, guys, one quick sales question and then an expense question. Any commentary you\u2019re willing to share just on sort of cadence given you were lapping. During the 2Q, given you were lapping the DoorDash launch and the launch of For Real advertising and then the start of the 3Q here. Brian Niccol : Yes, Andy from a dollar standpoint, our sales were even throughout the quarter and then they continued through \u2013 the trends continued through July. You did see a difference in the comp percentage as we moved from April to May and June, because we are comparing against the things that you mentioned. But from a dollar standpoint, we still see nice underlying strength and that continued into end of July as well. Andy Barish : Okay. And then can you give us a quick update, Jack. I think you mentioned that the $2 million of food cost saves, was that just a continuation of what you \u2013 what you saw in the first quarter, is that $2 million incremental? And then just more broadly from an organizational perspective, obviously, given the numbers you\u2019re putting up right now, cost saves efficiencies are kind of happening on their own, but are there some efforts that may bear some fruit as we look out to 2020 more on the peer cost save side of things. Jack Hartung : Yes. Andy, the $2 million is incremental on top of the run rate that we reported in the first quarter. And the team does continue to look at opportunities and there are a number of opportunities, Andy. So, I fully expect that we\u2019ll be talking about greater savings, especially as we move to the end of this year and into 2020. Andy Barish : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you. In the past, we\u2019ve talked about the ability to take price to the extent that there was any cost pressure whether from commodities or labor or anything else. Is 2% pricing the right thing for this brand, especially, looking at some of the absolute pricing of Chipotle versus some peers, which have obviously gotten higher. How much pricing do you think you have at this point that you could take to the extent that you needed to, that wouldn\u2019t have spend as current \u2013 excuse me, that wouldn\u2019t influence your current rate of customer traffic? Brian Niccol : Yes. So, we\u2019ve taken the approach on pricing that we don\u2019t want to be overly aggressive with it. I loved about the value proposition that we present today. Because as you mentioned a lot of other people that are doing real ingredients, real cooking, their prices are significantly higher than Chipotle and it just puts us in a very nice position, where if we need to take pricing. We have the pricing power to do it, but we want to be very judicious and when we choose to do it. And the good news for us is we see no reason to go beyond the 2% right now. But we\u2019ve also learned that we definitely have room to price beyond 2% if necessary. And if the environment mandates that, then we will do it accordingly. John Ivankoe : Okay, thank you. And that\u2019s just a quick modeling question. Your G&A in the second quarter look to have taken a step-down. Is that the new run rate in G&A per operating week; however, you want to look at it or was there anything unusual in the second quarter regarding G&A expense? Brian Niccol : Yes. that\u2019s close to a normal run rate. But keep in mind; we\u2019ve had a lot of things happening in the last year in terms of closing restaurants, which means you accelerate depreciation for a while, same with your offices. So, I think we\u2019re to more of a normal depreciation. but keep in mind as we open up new restaurants, especially, because we talked about opening up a heavy load in the fourth quarter, you\u2019ll see that in the fourth quarter as those stores open. You\u2019ll see some incremental additions to our depreciation and amortization at that time. John Ivankoe : Perfect, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Two questions just one specifically on the commodity front, I\u2019m wondering whether you can offer any color in terms of what basket inflation you\u2019re seeing today. I mean it sounds like you\u2019re saying pork is not an issue in coming quarters. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any directional trends you could offer whether you think there is some upward pressure expect as we look to 2020. It seems like that\u2019s what the industry is talking about. But I get the impression you perhaps don\u2019t see it the same way. And then I had one follow-up? Brian Niccol : Yes, Jeff. Avocados is the inflation story that we\u2019re seeing and it\u2019s not really sustained inflation. It\u2019s more of a cyclical thing; it\u2019s a supply and demand out of balance right now. We expect that to become more normal. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll necessarily get back to the prices that we paid in the first quarter this year, but it should drop from what we saw in Q2. We\u2019re seeing a little bit in dairy. We saw that is unique to us a little bit in Cilantro. But these are very, very minor and manageable items. We don\u2019t see or we\u2019re not anticipating anything significant with any of our proteins that could change between now and the end of the year. But right now, it looks like \u2013 it looks like other than avocados, the commodities are behaving. Jeffrey Bernstein : Got it. And then as we talk about kind of the outlook from an earnings perspective, I mean I understand the comp visibility you have based on the guidance you provided. but obviously, the earnings growth is critical. As you look to the back half of the year, any other changes you would expect, I mean, just not sure if you think the comps are maybe going to ease a little bit as you suggest on a tough compares, would you expect restaurant margin expansion to moderate, like how you\u2019re thinking about the puts and takes in the back half of the year with what seems like some very strong comp momentum and how that might flow through the earnings? Brian Niccol : Yes. on a year-over-year basis, if you\u2019re talking about a high single-digit comp versus a 10% comp. Yes, you\u2019re going to see a different margin leverage than that. And yet, Jeff, you can walk through the modeling to see what that would look like. But remember we had pretty strong margin at the end of last year. I would say the biggest wild card in terms of our margin potential is avocados. If avocados normalize, avocados increased by about 150 basis points, which is from Q1 to Q2. So, imagine if that comes back to us or a half of that comes back to us. Our margin potential gets much greater as avocados normalize. We have a shop that next year avocados could be more plentiful, a number of avocados kind of go in this every other year. next year should be a more plentiful year and I will see if it actually materializes. But I would say that\u2019s the biggest wild card. In terms of our flow through, we\u2019re really happy with the flow through that we\u2019ve seen with the comp that we\u2019ve gotten. If you do see a \u2013 or as you do see a lower comp, the flow through year-over-year is going to be somewhat less. But we think we\u2019ll still see some nice flow through based on the contribution margin that we earn. Jeffrey Bernstein : Nice to hear, avocado is the bigger issue than labor. That\u2019s a positive sign looking to 2020. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh from Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead with your question. Will Slabaugh : Yes. I think I just had a follow-up on the throughput comment that Brian you said earlier in your prepared remarks. Did you put any context around that in terms of where you are today versus you were previously, I guess the bottom as well. And then what you see as an opportunity going forward? Brian Niccol : I couldn\u2019t hear the first part of your question, I\u2019m sorry. Will Slabaugh : Yes. Sure, just to comment on throughput and you mentioned that in your current market, throughput, wondering if you could put some context around that in terms of where you are and what the opportunity is going forward. Brian Niccol : Sure. So, I think we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, where today, we\u2019re kind of in the mid-20s. In our peak throughput performance, we\u2019re kind of in the mid to low-30s. And I think the thing that I\u2019m excited about is the team is really focused on getting ourselves from that mid-20s to high-20s and then how this works. Once we get the high-20s, we\u2019ll be looking at low-30s. So that\u2019s what I mean by \u2013 we\u2019ve got terrific focus and we\u2019re seeing progress, and then you have these moments where people achieve something and then we\u2019re able to share that with everybody else in the organization, so that the throughput machine really starts to get going and people realize what\u2019s possible. So that\u2019s where we are today. We\u2019re definitely making progress on that mid-20 number and then once we move beyond kind of the mid-20s, high-20s, we\u2019ll be zeroing in on the low-30s. Will Slabaugh : Great. thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we will conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference call back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Brian Niccol : Okay. Thanks, everybody. And apologies for the technical difficulties that got us rolling, but we\u2019ve got it all sorted out and really appreciate you all taking the time to listen and ask questions. Obviously, very proud of our results, very proud of the team and very proud of what\u2019s happening in our restaurants. As I mentioned in our call, we\u2019ve got some very specific strategies that we\u2019re focused on around marketing, digital, operations and really using the stage-gate process on innovation. We\u2019re in the early days on a lot of these initiatives. We\u2019re delighted by the customer response we\u2019ve seen to date and we\u2019re delighted by the performance we\u2019re seeing in our restaurants today. And I look forward to sharing where we are next quarter with you all, on this journey for Chipotle to really cultivate a better world. So, thank you everybody and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be in touch. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We do thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, Global Head of IR. Please go ahead. Ashish Kohli : Hello, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter 2019 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements, including projections about comparable restaurant sales growth, new store openings, our effective tax rate and expected G&A expenses. These statements are based on management\u2019s current business and market expectations and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statement. Please see the risk factors contained in our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K and in our subsequent Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statement. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the Presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today\u2019s call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, our Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, our Chief Financial Officer. After which, we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Niccol : Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. We\u2019re pleased with our third quarter financial performance, which reflects further progress on our key strategic initiatives that are providing guests with a great experience and positioning the business to deliver above industry growth for many years to come. In fact, this marks the seventh consecutive quarter of accelerating comparable sales, which highlights that running great restaurants with a purpose of cultivating a better world is a compelling proposition. For the quarter, we reported 11% comparable restaurant sales growth that included nearly 7.5% transaction growth. Restaurant level margins of 20.8%, which is 210 basis points higher than last year. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $3.82, representing 77% year-over-year growth and digital sales growth of 88% year-over-year representing 18.3% of sales. I\u2019m often asked what\u2019s next. I believe we still have a lot of opportunity in executing our five key strategies, which are; number one, making the brand more visible and loved; number two, running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food, hospitality and throughput; number three, leveraging our digital make line to grow sales and expand access; number four, engaging with our customers by launching a new loyalty program; and number five, creating a stage-gate process for innovations. Let me give you an update on each of these starting with our stage-gate process, which is designed to test an item in a few markets on three key areas, delighting our customers, driving our financial benefit, and of course ensuring a seamless integration into our current operations. This test tends to be predictive of what happens nationally and helps increase the likelihood of success. I\u2019m pleased to announce that carne asada is the latest item behind Lifestyle Bowls and our Rewards program to be successfully validated through this process and all three are meeting or exceeding our expectations. Carne asada is a limited time offering that is easy to execute operationally and has a unique flavor profile. It\u2019s a tender cut of steak seasoned with fresh squeezed line and finish with hand chopped cilantro and a blend of signature spices. No wonder it\u2019s receiving terrific customer feedback. As great as carne asada taste, it\u2019s success is amplified by all elements of our strategy coming together in unison. Specifically, digital providing more frictionless access, marketing enhancing awareness and emphasizing the deliciousness of carne asada operations, delighting our guests with great hospitality and throughput and our supply chain, ensuring we have the highest quality ingredients that meet our food with integrity standards. I\u2019m so proud of the collective efforts of our teams rolling out this new premium steak. Beyond carne asada, we are also testing queso blanco, salads in quesadillas. These items are in various markets where we are gaining valuable feedback. As I\u2019ve stated previously, we\u2019re not going to roll out new menu items at the sacrifice of throughput nor will we add complexity to our restaurants by overemphasizing new menu choices. We will update you on our progress of all potential new menu items as they move through our stage-gate process. Now let\u2019s talk about our marketing efforts, which have and will continue to be an important enabler of our growth. In fact, you saw this with the carne asada launch as we leverage our digital capabilities as well as a national TV campaign by teaming up with film director David Gelb. These spots are a continuation of our Behind the Foil campaign that launched earlier this year and highlight real Chipotle team members and providing an inside look at the real fresh food and skill for preparation that happens in Chipotle kitchens every day. These efforts are designed to increase transactions and grow sales by driving culture, driving a difference and ultimately driving a purchase. In addition, we effectively utilize social media and ran several strategic promotions during the quarter to make the Chipotle brand more visible, while helping expand access. Going back to the question of what\u2019s next, we launched Chipotle Rewards in March and are just now beginning to leverage that platform. We currently have 7 million enrolled members and have only scratched the surface on database marketing. We are encouraged by early signs of transaction increases across all frequency bands and going forward, we\u2019ll double down on our ability to leverage this data to incent behaviors. We expect this lever to become a bigger driver over time as we gain more experience gathering customer insight, while continuing to expand our digital platform. Reducing friction and providing more convenient access for our guests has been critical to increasing our digital system penetration over the past couple of years. This quarter, digital sales grew 88% year-over-year to $257 million and represented 18.3% of sales during the seasonally slower summer quarter for digital. And we\u2019re knocking on the door of digital becoming $1 billion business. Consistent with past quarters delivery remained a key driver of our digital growth given enhanced capabilities on our app and website as well as our expanded availability from more than 97% of our restaurants. Importantly, digital remains highly incremental and we continue to see residual lift in delivery sales that lasts beyond any promotion. Additionally, I\u2019m pleased to announce that we have finished installing our digital make lines in all relevant restaurants and this was completed slightly ahead of schedule and makes the system more efficient for our guests, team members and delivery partners, while driving more sales and loyalty for Chipotle. Now that we have the digital make lines installed, we are focused on ensuring that execution for this large and growing business matched that of the traditional front line. This brings me to the evergreen topic of operational excellence. The reality is that all the growth initiatives I just mentioned are being supported by the terrific job our operations team is doing in providing a great guest experience. And we know cultivating a better world includes investing in our people. And we believe that\u2019s the right approach in creating an environment where our employees can thrive professionally as well as personally and be in a position to win not only today but also in the future. Enhanced training and development, industry-leading employee benefits, including the recent Debt-Free Degrees program in addition to our newly expanded tuition reimbursement program and a new crew bonus that was paid out to more than 2,600 employees last quarter are just a few examples of how we continue to invest in our people to cultivate a better restaurant culture. The result is our employees putting their best foot forward and remaining focused on our core fundamentals. This is leading to us attracting and retaining the right talent and having higher teams stability, which is allowing them to spend more time together and deliver on two important benefits. One, delicious food consistently being prepared and served every time, something our guests have definitely noticed. And number two, we\u2019re seeing a steady improvement in throughput aided by training, focus and providing our teams with an easy to use dashboard that provides greater visibility on performance. I want to recognize our team for their efforts and hard work in delivering another outstanding quarter. I believe we are still in the early stages of our journey and we need to stay focused on our priorities and executing flawlessly to support our growth, while providing our customers with the experience they expect from Chipotle. Thank you to all our employees for all that you do. We have a unique brand and I love the passion and determination that I see during my restaurant visits as our crew members constantly strive to be better today than they were yesterday. With that, here\u2019s Jack to walk you through the financials. Jack Hartung : Thanks, Brian and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered outstanding financial results in the third quarter as comps and margins continued to expand further highlighting the strength of our economic model. Connecting with guests through culturally relevant marketing focused on Chipotle\u2019s great taste and real ingredients, while providing more convenient access is helping lead to greater overall demand. Sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, an increase of 14.6% from last year. Comp sales grew 11% in the quarter, which includes a 10 basis point reduction as a result of deferred revenue from our Rewards program. This deferral is lower than previous quarters due to a combination of an increase in free entr\u00e9e redemptions as guests earned enough points and an adjustment and breakage rate assumption for chips and guacamole now that we have more history. Moving forward, we expect quarterly deferral to range between 20 basis points and 40 basis points based on various factors including the pace of signups and promotional activity. Restaurant level margins of 20.8% expanded 210 basis points over last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $3.82, a 77% year-over-year growth. The third quarter had unusual expenses related to our transformation as well as legal reserves that negatively impacted our earnings per share by about $0.35, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $3.47. Our comp of 11% was driven by an acceleration in transactions as nearly 7.5% of the comp came from greater guests visit. The higher average check includes a price impact of about 2% and a mixed contribution of roughly 1.5% driven predominantly by digital orders, which have a higher average check. Looking to the fourth quarter, factoring in strong sales we have seen thus far in October as well as the tougher comparison from last year, we expect Q4 comps to be in a high single digit range. This will result in our 2019 full year comp guidance being at the top end of our high single digit range. We opened 25 new restaurants in the quarter bringing our total openings for the year to 60. And based on the early success of Chipotlanes, we shifted our real estate strategy to seek more sites that can accommodate a Chipotlane. As a result of the more than 80 restaurants currently at construction, about half of them will have a Chipotlane, which will result in a total of about 60 Chipotlanes by the end of 2019. Given the longer construction timeline associated with Chipotlane, some of these new openings are likely to shift from Q4 into early 2020, so expect our total openings for 2019 to fall at or slightly below the low end of our 2019 range of 142 to 155 openings. For 2020 we anticipate opening between 150 and 165 new restaurants with more than half including a Chipotlane. And we expect these openings will be better balance throughout the year with around 60 openings in the first half of the year versus only 35 openings through June of this year. Food cost for the quarter were 33.2%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year due primarily to a menu price increase that was partially offset by higher cost of several ingredients. On a sequential basis, avocado pricing moderated as we expected. This was the result of sourcing more supply from Peru, which reduced our reliance on Mexico. For Q4 we expect ongoing moderation in avocado pricing as a result of increasing supply in the back half of the quarter, but we believe this will be largely offset by the higher cost of carne asada resulting in cost of sales remaining in the low to mid 33% range. Labor costs for the quarter were 26.6%, a decrease of 60 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage, partially offset by labor inflation, which continues to be in the 4% to 5% range. It also includes 20 basis point additional investment related to our restaurant level performance incentives including the crew bonus, Brian mentioned earlier. We expect Q4 labor costs to be in the high 26% range given extra initial labor expenses associated with a significant number of new restaurants being opened in this quarter as well as lower seasonal sales in the fourth quarter. Other operating costs for the quarter were 12.8% a decrease of 90 basis points from Q3 of last year due to lower marketing and promo cost as well as sales leverage. Marketing and promo cost were 2% in the quarter, a decrease of about 50 basis points compared to Q3 of last year as we decided to shift some of our marketing investment to Q4 to support carne asada and other promotions. As a result, we expect our marketing investment to be at or slightly above 4% in Q4, which will result in the full year investment remaining right around 3% of sales. G&A for the quarter was approximately $115 million on a GAAP basis or $105 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding about $7.5 million for settlements of several legal matters and $2.5 million related to transformation expenses. It also includes $72 million in underlying G&A expenses, $25 million related to non-cash stock compensation, $5 million related to higher bonus accruals from our strong performance and payroll taxes on stock option exercises and $3 million related to other expenses including our All Manager Conference, which will be held in March of next year. Underlying G&A with a little lower than expected as we continue to finish rounding out our organizational structure. We\u2019re expecting to fill open positions in Q4 and therefore, we believe our underlying G&A support will get to around $74 million to $75 million in Q4. Also, if we assume our current financial trends continue stock compensation, including performance adjustments, along with the higher bonus expenses should be right around $25 million. Lastly, we\u2019re expecting to recognize between $2 million and $3 million for expenses in Q4, related to our upcoming All Manager Conference. And we expect the total expense to be right around $16 million, most of which will hit in Q1 of next year. Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 17.9% on a GAAP basis and 18.3% on a non-GAAP basis. Both these rates are lower or below our full year guidance range due to the recognition of excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation during the quarter. For Q4, we expect underlying effective tax rate to be in the 26% to 29% range, though it may vary based on discrete items as well as any stock option exercises. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investments totaling $844 million, as of September 30. We repurchased $39 million of our stock at an average share price of $783 during the quarter. In closing, we\u2019re pleased with our Q3 results as our strategic growth initiatives continue to sustain strong sales momentum, which is a key driver of our economic model. We remain bullish about the future and we believe we still have plenty of runway ahead. I just want to thank all of our restaurant team members for their contribution and their passion as they remain Chipotle\u2019s most valuable asset as we worked together to cultivate a better world. With that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Katherine Fogertey with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Katherine Fogertey : Great, thank you. I\u2019m just trying to get a handle around the new unit guidance. So you guys expect additions to new units to go now at the lower end of the 140 to 155. And some of those are getting pushed into next year. Does the new unit guidance then implicitly state that you guys are slowing down the pace of new restaurant adds? I\u2019m just trying to get a handle on what are the puts and takes between unit growth here when coupled with the very strong comp momentum in the quarter? Thank you. Brian Niccol : Yes. Thanks, Kathy. So no, the plan is actually, I think the guidance that we shared is we\u2019re going to be accelerating new units as we move into 2020. And I think, what we just wanted to share with people is, a greater blend of that will now include Chipotlane, which we\u2019ve accelerated the composition of Chipotlanes in our new unit kind of growth trajectory going forward. So the good news is with 11% comp and 7.5% transactions and really strong margins, we\u2019re now going to be able to push on how we continue to expand our new units going forward. So this is really just one of these temporary things, whereas we take advantage of an opportunity with the Chipotlane, which really I think it is a terrific outcome because it will drive our digital results as well as drive the total business, which hopefully as we\u2019ve seen to date will result in even better returns going forward as we build out the new units. So no plan to slowdown, if anything, our guidance was intended to inform people we\u2019re going to be increasing. And we also wanted to be share with folks that we\u2019re going to have a greater mix now Chipotlanes. Katherine Fogertey : Can you help us also just to remind us on the AUVs for restaurants with Chipotlanes versus those without? How we should think about how that blend might progress? Brian Niccol : Yes. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re disclosing exactly what the AUVs are on this. But here\u2019s what it is, I think we can give you some interesting facts on it, which is our digital business is roughly 50% bigger and the driver of that additional growth is our order ahead business, which as you know, it has got the best margin associated with our business going forward. So we loved the composition of the sales and we love the economics associated with new units, whether they have Chipotlanes or not. But we\u2019re very positive on which Chipotlane brings to our new unit program and why we\u2019re raising guidance for next year. Katherine Fogertey : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi, good afternoon and congrats on another great quarter. Jack, I was wondering if you could maybe clarify what you meant around the Q4 guidance. I think you mentioned that October so far has been strong and you\u2019re expecting maybe that to ease, as it is cycle tougher comparisons coming up. So could you maybe just elaborate on what you\u2019re seeing in October so we have the right context for the rest of the quarter? And then Brian, you mentioned that you\u2019re seeing some progress on throughput in the restaurants, I was just wondering if you could contextualize what that progress has been so far and how you see that playing out in 2020? Thanks. Jack Hartung : Yes, David on comp. We saw comps accelerate in September, when we initially rolled out carne asada, which is around September 12 or so. And then we started media around September 22. So we saw sales accelerate at the end of the quarter and then we saw those higher sales levels continue into October. The guidance that we\u2019re giving for the fourth quarter though it takes into account the strong comps as we start the quarter, but also that our strongest comp month last year was December, so going up against the tougher comparison in December. That\u2019s when we had the delivery bowls and those were very, very successful. The other thing, I want to mention is, we only have enough supply for carne asada to last us for part of the quarter. We think we\u2019ll probably run out around the end of November, maybe into early December. And so we\u2019re being a little cautious with what happens once we run out of carne asada. But the momentum to start the quarter is great, but we got a tougher challenge as we move through the quarter. Brian Niccol : And then, yes, to your second question, David, on throughput. The thing that I think is really exciting to see is as each quarter has gone by with the focus on this. We continue to see every region making progress on their throughput goals. So we\u2019re not all the way to where we have targeted, but we are making great progress and our throughput is better than it was last quarter and it\u2019s definitely better than it was two quarters ago. So the operational team is very focused. Scott has the guys dialed in on this and our throughput is continuing to improve quarter-to-quarter, month-to-month. So I\u2019m very optimistic about what that\u2019s going to do for the business going forward. David Tarantino : All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Sara Senatore : A question about margins if I could, which is just about the fact that it\u2019s been a little bit volatile this year, but in the end, very good margin expansion and maybe for the full year, EBIT margin on a recurring basis, maybe as much as high 100 to 200 basis points something in that range. But I guess that implies a very high flow through margin, even on a 10% comp. So could you just deconstruct that a little bit? Especially, because you have a traffic-driven comp, there\u2019s not a lot of price in there. Is that digital mix? Are there cost savings that are coming through? And is it still the case that when we think about potential return to peak volumes, we should think about restaurant level margins that are maybe below what they would have been at previous peaks? Or are you finding opportunities again between throughput order ahead is sort of structurally offset, whatever the headwinds may have been? Brian Niccol : Yes, Sara. The way I would think about margins is I think most of the leverage, it\u2019s from flow through. So we do get a higher, a very attractive flow through, when we have higher sales, especially when they\u2019re transaction-driven like this. We have some headwinds in there. That we have to overcome, like we do have labor inflation that 4% to 5%, that\u2019s about a 100 basis point headwind, avocados to get better in the quarter. So we had bigger headwinds from avocados in Q2 than Q3. And then moving into Q4, we\u2019ve got a little bit of a challenge. The carne asada\u2019s more expensive, a cut of meat. It\u2019s a higher quality premium cut of steak. So that puts a little bit of pressure on our food costs. But I would say that from overall margin standpoint, we\u2019re pretty much right on track. We talked about at $2.1 million volume, we should generate a margin of about 21% and we\u2019re right about there. In terms of as you move from $2.1 million to $2.2 million to $2.3 million up to if we get back to our peak volumes of $2.5 million, we\u2019re still confident that we\u2019ll be right in that same kind of margin range of like a 25%. So we think the flow through so far is pretty much right on track. Sara Senatore : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Nicole Miller of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Nicole Miller : Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to understand what might be the tipping point on the acquisition of customer data. I believe, you said 7 million loyalty members. So right now the comps are producing, I would imagine it\u2019s not doing much yet with that data. So maybe you could talk about what you\u2019re doing with the data, but the power of what it can be \u2013 what it can do, now that you have a 7 million base and is that enough of a base to produce results? Brian Niccol : Yes. Thanks, Nicole. The \u2013 obviously, we\u2019re delight we\u2019ve got 7 million users now in rewards program. We anticipate that\u2019s going to continue to grow. And as I mentioned in the past, we are already starting some experimentation with the various cohorts. And the good news is, when we have done some of these experiments, we\u2019ve seen meaningful changes in peoples\u2019 frequency and their engagement levels with the brand. So I think this is something that ongoing, as we roll into 2020, it starts \u2013 it\u2019s going to start being a contributor to our sales growth. Because we\u2019ll have a meaningful database with meaningful numbers of users and I think we\u2019re learning really quickly and figuring out what really does result in behavior changes that rewards people and at the same time rewards the business with incremental transactions and incremental sales. So I\u2019m very optimistic about what this can do for us. The database marketing is showing signs of being a really meaningful growth lever going forward. Nicole Miller : Thank you. And just a follow-up and last question, Chipotle is clearly getting stronger every day. So when you think about the development acceleration for next year, is there anything in there for international growth and if not, when and how do you leverage that international opportunity? Brian Niccol : Yes. So the reality is exactly what you said, which is the health of the business and the operational performance gives us confidence to accelerate new units next year. And then you compound that with adding to the mix, new growth lever called Chipotlanes, which is a driver of digital sales and highly profitable sales. We\u2019re really excited about what our growth opportunity is from new unit standpoint in United States, so very excited about that. At the same time, we\u2019re continuing to work on our business in Canada, which they have made tremendous progress to date. And if they continue to deliver the financial performance that they\u2019re delivering, which is now getting close to what we\u2019re seeing in the U.S., obviously, that\u2019ll be a place down the road that we will look to accelerate new units as well. We\u2019re still probably in the earlier innings in Europe. Because we\u2019re still learning there on what we can do with our Chipotle business. But again, the team there is making great progress as well. But still some work to be done there on both the model and how we continue to introduce Chipotle in the new markets. But I just want to emphasize, there is so much opportunity in the U.S., with the performance that we\u2019re getting out of our business. As well as frankly, the types of restaurants we can build going forward, the combination of end-caps, and now end-caps with Chipotlanes as well as the inline unit and then the freestanding restaurants that we\u2019ve done to date. So we\u2019re very optimistic about where we can go with our unit growth in United States. And then obviously, down the road, we\u2019ll figure out how we pivot outside the U.S. Nicole Miller : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from David Palmer of Evercore. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. Good evening. Question on labor, I think your labor hours per unit went up more like high-single digits this quarter versus mid-single digits in the first half of the year. I know you can tell me if I\u2019m right on that, but if it did ramp up, why? And more broadly, even beyond this quarter, how do you view that leverage point going forward? Is that second make line, for example, fully staffed and ready to go? And should we see similar levels of labor leverage? Or is there more to be had or even less because you\u2019re not up to where you need to be? Thanks. Jack Hartung : Yes, David. I would say, the labor leverage hit exactly where it should be. I\u2019m not sure, how you\u2019re doing your calculation. We had additional transactions of 7.5%. We grow our labor hours at a lesser percent than sales, quite a bit lesser percent. So when you say high-single-digit, that\u2019s not what we actually added. We would have added something quite a bit less than 7.5% in terms of the hours. And if you breakdown the labor leverage, we had labor leverage of about 60 basis points in the quarter and that\u2019s despite the fact that we had about 100 basis points of inflation challenge that we had to deal with. So we really labor \u2013 leveraged the labor line by about 160 basis points and that\u2019s really right on the target. Now going forward with digital, we do think there\u2019s an opportunity with digital for us to get even more efficient. We\u2019re in the early innings there. Chipotlane, we\u2019ve only got 20 Chipotlane restaurants right now, but we\u2019re going to have 60 by the end of the year. And we\u2019ll learn more about how we staff the Chipotlanes and how we can really get as much as efficiency that we know is possible, out of moving more of the sales towards that second make line. So, so far we\u2019re really pleased with where labor is, but we do think that there\u2019s additional efficiencies as the second make line grows. David Palmer : I guess my second point was really about, in that second make line, are those staffed and are you effectively at a low capacity utilization on that second make line currently and therefore that incremental margin is going to be outstanding, perhaps even better than the first line? Or is that something that you\u2019re not, where you need to be in terms of staffing when that mix gets up to where some of your better digital make line stores are staffed? Thanks. Brian Niccol : Yes. David, I got your question. It\u2019s a good question. In our very busiest digital restaurant, those things are fully staffed and I think there\u2019s additional leverage to be had. There are areas of the country and there are individual stores where the digital business is not at that same 18%. We do have challenges in making sure we\u2019ve got the right staffing throughout the day and every single day. So there are opportunities for us to staff those restaurants, so that the business will build, but I will tell you in terms of the levers that you\u2019re getting at with the restaurants that are already at 18%, 20%, 25% digital, those restaurants are staffed. And as we add more sales to the second make line, you\u2019re going to see greater sales leverage in those stores. David Palmer : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John Glass : Hi, thanks very much. Just on digital sales, I understand there\u2019s some seasonality, but I was still surprised to see sequentially about the same percentage of sales as digital. So maybe what gives you confidence that you aren\u2019t hitting some sort of ceiling in that, the consumer doesn\u2019t want to transact more than they are in digital channels. And can you talk specifically about how delivery has performed in this quarter relative to prior quarters? Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So what we\u2019ve seen is the seasonality was more around the delivery aspect of the business, in our digital business because we continue to see growth in our order ahead business. And so, what we\u2019ve also seen is we\u2019ve come out of kind of the summer months where the seasonality was is, that strength in continued on with the order ahead business and then consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in the past, the seasonality played out in the delivery side of the business. So we\u2019re definitely confident that we are far from the ceiling. And then we\u2019ve got other indications where when we\u2019ve added additional access like the Chipotlane, you get well beyond 20%. So that\u2019s what gives us confidence that we\u2019re far from the ceiling on this. John Glass : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just on carne asada, is this \u2013 was this intended to be an LTO or what \u2013 why are you running out of product and is it just temporary or is it, you\u2019re just going to pause this in-and-out? I thought it was more like, you were going to try attempting to build sort of permanent new sales items, not LTOs? Brian Niccol : Yes. This was intended to be a seasonal offering where we would bring it in-and-out. There are other items like queso blanco, we\u2019re assuming it the success for the stage-gate-process, that\u2019ll be more permanent. But yes, this one initially was intended to be more of a product represent some news and we may use it again depending on how the whole experience plays out. The early feedback we\u2019ve seen from our customers and our crew members is, they definitely would like us to do this again. So, we\u2019ll figure out exactly the right pacing and sequencing and whether or not it\u2019s something we want to have permanently in the business or if we continue to use it more as like a seasonal item. John Glass : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Brian Niccol : Yes. Operator : The next question comes from Jake Bartlett of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Jake Bartlett : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask a follow-up on the carne asada, my kind of chats or just even my experience in the stores was that the carne asada was selling significantly more than the regular steak. And so I assumed that, that was driving a decent amount of checks. So within that the context of that, of those statements, could you talk about how October has been impacted by the carne asada? And maybe what we could expect to kind of fall-off with the carne asada\u2019s removal. Brian Niccol : Okay. Yes, sure. So, we have gotten great response to the carne asada initiative. We\u2019re really excited to see that the stage-gate-process was predictive of what we\u2019ve seen nationally. So we\u2019re really delighted about that. We\u2019re seeing it drive both check-in transactions, which is also another thing we\u2019re very excited about. And what we\u2019re seeing is, it\u2019s sourcing new users as well as having people that have been users of the Chipotle business to try a new occasion. So we\u2019re seeing frequency compression and we\u2019re seeing new users coming in. What we\u2019ll obviously want to continue to understand, which we\u2019ve got some understanding on is, what happens to all those new users that came in now that they\u2019ve experienced the Chipotle business and historically, Chipotle has been very sticky beyond just one product, it\u2019s the whole value proposition that get people excited about Chipotle. The idea of Food With Integrity, the idea of customization, the idea of speed, and then obviously putting that all together at a really reasonable price, it\u2019s something that\u2019s very sticky for the Chipotle business. So we think this is much bigger than just the product. It\u2019s more about introducing people to the Chipotle experience ongoing. Jake Bartlett : Got it. And I don\u2019t know if Jack would you want to just share what it\u2019s kind of done to how much it\u2019s been helping the October sales in mix. But also just building on that question, if it\u2019s sounds like its successful in driving check and driving traffic and kind of hitting everything you want it to, why not keep it around or do it more permanently? Is it a matter of the throughput or is it a matter of the supply being a little more difficult? What would be the reason why not to keep on offering it? Jack Hartung : Yes, so look, the main driver is, we were not willing to compromise on our Food With Integrity principles on the supply over this program. And so going into it, we knew the supply available would take us through November to early December. And, something we\u2019re going to work on going forward, given the response we\u2019ve seen is, okay, how do we work on the supply of steak in that particular cut to be consistent with our Food With Integrity principles to give us the flexibility to do it beyond just the seasonal program. But I don\u2019t think we can answer your specific question that you\u2019re looking for on exactly how is it playing out in the product mix and the comp. Obviously it\u2019s playing a positive role. Jake Bartlett : Got it. Jack Hartung : That\u2019s where I would leave it. Jake Bartlett : Okay. I appreciate it. Jack Hartung : Sure. Operator : The next question is from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good afternoon. I am wanted to follow up on the Chipotlanes and as well on the carne asada. So on Chipotlanes, could you \u2013 Jack give us any idea on kind of what the incremental cost is when you add the Chipotlanes to locations and maybe what the unit economics are that we should think about for 2020 associated with those new openings? And then on carne asada, any quantification around what it did to COGS either in the September quarter or what we should expect in the fourth quarter? Jack Hartung : Yes, Sharon on the investment, the investments about an extra $75,000 to add Chipotlanes, that would be for like an end-cap building. It\u2019s the same $75,000 on a free standard, but a free standard just cost more than an end-cap. So our emphasis so far has been on getting the vast majority of our sites should be on the end-cap. We\u2019re trying to get as many end-caps with Chipotlanes as possible, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been able to pretty quickly pivot so that we can have more than half of our portfolio. Now we\u2019ll have the Chipotlanes. So it\u2019s a relatively modest investment. Too early to say on the sales what the difference is between Chipotlanes and non- Chipotlanes, Sharon, we\u2019ve got 20 of these that spread throughout the country. I\u2019ll tell you they\u2019re opening up nicely. We\u2019re very pleased with the results. I just wouldn\u2019t want to put a number on whether it\u2019s performing at or above from a sales standpoint, but the fact that it\u2019s 50% above on digital it\u2019s a very strong starting point. We know that when you can operate Chipotlanes with less friction, meaning it\u2019s easier to order, it\u2019s easy to stop-in and pick up Chipotlane without even getting out of your car. That tends to cause our customer to want to get your Chipotlanes even more often. So our optimism, even though it\u2019s very early is very strong and the economics with even a modest increase in sales at that kind of an incremental investment is going to be very attractive. Sharon Zackfia : And then on carne asada, if you could help quantify the impact on your COGS for the third and fourth quarters. Jack Hartung : Yes, it\u2019s going to be about it \u2013 it\u2019s very small in the third quarter, Sharon, because it was only in for a few weeks, but it\u2019s going to be in the ballpark of 50 basis points. And so \u2013 that\u2019s what we mentioned in our guidance that our food costs in Q4 is going to stay about the same, maybe a tick or two higher. Even though avocados are going to cause less in the fourth quarter, that\u2019s going to be offset by carne asada and we\u2019re guessing right now, again, we\u2019re trying to predict what the rest of the quarter is going to look like when we\u2019ll run out. But it looks like it\u2019s probably going to be right around 50 basis point impact in the quarter. Sharon Zackfia : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Two questions, just one following up on the, I guess menu relation. Brian, it sounds like the carne asada success, I\u2019m wondering how you literally would define success in terms of maybe what mix you\u2019ve achieved thus far or what you think is the target level and maybe any color on the case of DSL. In case, you talked about what potential hurdles there would be to overcome in the stage-gate-process before we might see any or all of those? And then I have one follow-up. Brian Niccol : Yes, look on a carne asada, I mean what we did in this stage-gate-process was, we wanted to make sure we had a product that consumers wanted. We wanted to make sure we had a product that our operators could execute. And then obviously we wanted to make sure it made sense financially. And the way we derive that financial benefit is through check and transactions. The good news is carne asada has done terrific on the traffic driving as well as the check driving. And then our operators, to their credit have done job in executing and the feedback we\u2019re getting from consumers, both new users and existing consumers, is they love the product. So by all accounts, we\u2019re delighted with what carne asada is doing for the business. And as you fast forward to other initiatives, our intention is we want to derive all those types of benefits when we\u2019re launching a product. So, queso blanco, same expectations, needs to be something our crews can execute with excellence, consistent with our Food With Integrity principles. It\u2019s got to be something the consumer is going to say they love it and they want to try it again. And then obviously it\u2019s got to play a role in the financial model so that it\u2019s continuing to move Chipotle forward. And that\u2019s the reason why we test these things. And, some will play a bigger role in traffic driving than others and that\u2019s why you got to have a pipeline of different products to play a different role in the business. So I\u2019m really excited about what the pipeline looks like and very delighted really about carne asada going through this whole process and then everybody executing with excellence. That\u2019s how we end up with a successful initiative. Jeffrey Bernstein : Got it. And can you just for color, maybe Jack on the marketing stand, I think you said 4% in the fourth quarter, which would lead the full year at 3%. I\u2019m just wondering how you measure the return on that and whether we should think about 2020 being more in the 4% range or whether there\u2019s a reason why you prefer to keep it up that lower 3% level? Jack Hartung : No, I mean Jeff we have no plans to do that, that could change as the year unfolds. But right now we think 3% about the right level, right now we think we\u2019re getting a great return. You know the marketing team, every single campaign they look at what\u2019s happening in terms of transaction, what the return is and so far we\u2019ve been getting a great return on our dollar. So right now we think 3% is the right level. If we \u2013 should change in the future, we\u2019ll communicate that. Jeffrey Bernstein : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : Great. Thank you. I was hoping to get an update on some of the supply chain initiatives that we\u2019ve been talking about in 2019. If there\u2019s an update in terms of how much money was saved in the third quarter, if there\u2019s an outlook for the fourth quarter and what the visibility is for some of the supply chain work on fiscal 2020 to start contribute more meaningfully the margins overall. Jack Hartung : Yes. John, we\u2019ve saved another few million dollars during the quarter, but it was offset by other things including, some of the carne asada pressure that we saw in the last three weeks of the month. But listen, the team\u2019s been doing a lot of great work and we think that we\u2019ll see more savings in 2020. Too early to predict what those are going to be. I mean, a lot of these things will take time because you\u2019re talking about long-term relationship with suppliers, but I expect we\u2019ll be able to talk next year about even more savings from the efforts of the supply chain team. John Ivankoe : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Andy Barish with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Andy Barish : Yes. Wondering on kind of looking out, obviously, the second half margin progress, which we thought wasn't quite going to be a strong as the first half may act otherwise, but I wonder if you look out to 2020 and kind of give us a sense of the puts and takes, I assume, pricing is going to remain around 2%. Any early thoughts on kind of the protein basket just as we try to gauge some of the margin levers for next year as we sit here today? Jack Hartung : Yes, Andy, we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary right now. It's too early to get a precise prediction, but it looks like beef generally to the extent that we can get the supply of food with integrity cuts that Brian mentioned, it looks like that should be pretty stable. We don't see anything out of the new ordinary in chicken. We see what's happening with pork supplies throughout the world. Our supplies are separate from that and so we haven't seen any impact there. So right now we're kind of crossing our fingers and hope that everything continues to look stable. We're also hoping for a benign or maybe even a positive benefit from avocados next year is going to be the alternate year where we should see a more plentiful harvest. And so right now, knock on wood, cross fingers, all that kind of stuff. It looks like a pretty stable cost of goods sales environment for next year. Andy Barish : And do you anticipate menu price kind of staying in this 2%-ish area? Jack Hartung : You know, we're studying that right now. Andy, if we did anything, it definitely would be in that kind of 2% range, but no decisions have been made. Andy Barish : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles : Great, thanks guys. On Chipotlanes, what percent of the existing 2,500 non-Chipotlane locations have the capacity or the ability to add a Chipotlane versus the amount that are structural enable and just also just curious about your appetite to retrofit these locations as you go through 2020 and beyond? Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So there on our current estate there really aren't that many options out there for us to retrofit into the Chipotlane only because we don't have that many end caps historically. Chipotle really was in line unit execution. So we're just limited with the real estate that we have and then you've got to have the end cap in the right location in order to do a retrofit. With that said, where the opportunity exist, we've done one, and not surprising, we saw positive result given for what Jack said earlier, when you get people more access with less friction, the order ahead business continues to take steps forward. So limited opportunity in retrofit but lots of opportunity going forward as we build new restaurants. Andrew Charles : That's helpful. And I know you're reluctant to give numbers in details on Chipotlane, but when you talk about year-to-cash on cash returns for new store of around 40%. Is it right to think that Chipotlane is higher than that just given this is a winning prototype for future development? Jack Hartung : I mean, it's early but, yes, we would expect to Chipotlanes are going to be a higher return than the average portfolio. Andrew Charles : Thanks, guys. Operator : Next question will be from Gregory Frankfurt with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Gregory Frankfurt : Maybe just going back on to Andrew's question, in terms of the operating model for Chipotlanes going forward, I guess, right now, you can only order ahead as you pull up to a Chipotlane. what's the likelihood that you shift this model to more of a traditional drive through operating structure at some point down the line? I guess what's going to I guess prevent you from making that shift at some point? Thanks. Brian Niccol : Well, nothing would prevent us from making the shift. We just don't believe it's the right shift. So what we've seen is giving people the access through ordering ahead, so that they don't have to get other car is a nice unlock for the Chipotle business so that we don't have to provide the additional complexity of running a traditional drive through. Frankly, I think this is the future of how people will want to interact with restaurant companies because this is arguably faster than any other way possible to get your food. You order ahead and you don't have to get out of your car and our model is already fast now. Now, we've made it fast assuming that we get out of your car, come into the restaurant, grab your food and go. So we don't see any reason to make that pivot going forward. Gregory Frankfurt : Got it. Can you maybe talk about the experience so far in terms of balancing consumers kind of timing when they show up at the restaurant with kind of when the food is ready, and if they show up early, and how you manage through that and kind of how you would expect to manage that as you go forward? Thank you very much. Brian Niccol : Sure. So you have \u2013 with our smart pickup times, you do select a time for when your food is going to be ready and then you show up with it. If you show up early, we usually have people just pull forward and tell them they can come into the restaurant at their time or there are times where we will bring the food out to them where they pull forward. The good news is what we've seen is after the restaurant opens and two or three weeks in, people get into a pretty good rhythm where they shop on time and once they realize this is how the Chipotlane works and we've gotten really great consumer acceptance and the right type of behavior going forward. So that's not been a problem to-date and it's really just a matter of people adopting the new approach to how you get your food in your car. Gregory Frankfurt : Helpful perspective. Thank you. Brian Niccol : Yes. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please go ahead. Peter Saleh : Great, thanks. With 7 million loyalty members now, can you talk a little bit about the composition of the customer. Are they new users or they lapsed customers and just maybe a little bit more detail. Are these loyalty customers, are they spending more, are they coming in more frequently? Any details around that would be helpful. Thanks. Brian Niccol : Yes, of course. So this is a question I love to answer because the thing that's been great about the program to-date is it's definitely got bigger representation of new and light/medium users, and what we're seeing is when we do communicate with them with certain incentives, we see behavioral changes that are very positive and so we're seeing all the things you would want to see in a rewards program from a standpoint of the composition of those that are in the rewards program and then the behaviors associated with those that are within the program. So a lot of new light and medium users, and then we're seeing really nice behavior associated with all those various cohorts. Peter Saleh : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question will be from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Please go ahead. Chris O'Cull: Yes. Thanks. Brian, given the supply of Carne Asada, it is going to run out late November, what are the plans to continue driving usage from guests that came in for the product. I mean, I'm just wondering if we should expect a new product news before the end of the year? And then I had a follow-up. Brian Niccol : Yes. Our plan is those that come in with Carne Asada, they get a great Chipotle experience that is going to result in them wanting to come back even with Carne Asada is not on the menu. And we're obviously focused on continuing to drive that message throughout the whole quarter. So we probably have already seen it on television; we are running ads that both talk about Chipotle as the brand and the total restaurant company as well as driving Carne Asada. So \u2013 and what we've seen is the response has been positive to both messages. So people are very much in tune with the idea of food with integrity, real culinary, real ingredients, cooking done right in front of them, as well as some new product menu news around Carne Asada. And the good news is Chris and the marketing team, they've got a strong plan to finish the year that goes well beyond just products. Chris O'Cull: Okay, that's fair. And then, Brian, would you talk about how the company to determine the appropriate number of unit openings for 2020 and what you would need to see to accelerate the number of openings? Brian Niccol : Yes, look, the good news is, there are plenty of sites and the economics would support going faster and doing more. What we wanted to really make sure is we've got the people and capability in place and I think we're seeing more and more confidence as our stability has gone up, and as we've opened new restaurants, they continue to open really well. So we're going to continue to build a really strong pipeline, which we have for next year, and if the opportunity presents itself to go a little faster, obviously we'll. But I think I've been pretty consistent with this one, which is the key for us to continue to have great unit growth is to have great unit economics. And I think that's what we're demonstrating is tremendous unit economics. So I'm not surprising as the unit economics continue to improve. There is more and more sites that are available for us and then now we've just added another lever called the Chipotlane, which I think is going to open even more sites for us in the future. So we've been very purposeful to be \u2013 I think very measured in how we go about ramping up our new unit development. But I think there is plenty of opportunity for us to grow from where we are today and what we probably will do in 2020. Chris O'Cull: Great. Thanks. Operator : And our last question today will come from John Tower with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. John Tower : Taking the question, just going back to the digital piece of the business, with digital and specifically order ahead mix moving higher as a percentage of your sales, does this potentially open up more opportunities on the menu over time? I'm thinking specifically about your Quesadillas and how, at least when you're testing now requires about a 30-second cook time with new kitchen equipment. So in a traditional store that might gum up throughput, but if you're doing Chipotlanes where you've got a greater mix of order ahead, obviously that seems to tie in better in that type of a store. So does it potentially open up more opportunities for your menu? Brian Niccol : Look, I think it's great about the digital business and the digital make line is it does present the opportunity for us to look at opportunities that historically we may not have been able to look at, because I think you can use that make line in various ways, whether it's fulfilling directly digital orders or helping alleviate the front line. So it's definitely something we're continuing to contemplate because it just presents a tremendous opportunity for us. We've got now additional capacity with really great economics associated with that additional capacity. We before was not be thinking about how we can drive, why can't we drive that harder and that's what the team focused on is how do we drive that harder because we like the results every time that business growth. So \u2013 and I wouldn't just have it be the idea of just product. I think there's other ways to drive people into that digital business and then ultimately leverage that digital make line. John Tower : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. A - Brian Niccol : Okay, thank you. And thanks for all the questions and thanks for joining us today. Obviously, where I started this conversation is, I'm tremendously proud of the Chipotle team, all of our team members in the field. You don't deliver 7.5% transaction growth and an 11% comp unless you've got an organization that is all rolling together and I think the culture is tremendously strong, both in the support centers and in the restaurants, and I think what we've demonstrated with Carne Asada is we also now have a muscle where we can do new product innovation, as well as driving the digital system. And I'm also really delighted about the unlock that I think Chipotlanes is going to present for us from our new unit opportunities going forward. So a lot of growth opportunities in front of Chipotle, a tremendous quarter I think that the team delivered most recently and couldn't be prouder of where we are, but I'm also really excited about where we're going. So thank you for joining us and we'll talk soon. Take care. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ashish Kohli : Hello, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2019 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements, including projections about comparable restaurant sales growth, new store openings, our effective tax rate and expected G&A expenses.  These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statement.  Please see the risk factors contained in our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statement. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the Presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chief Executive Officer, and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian. Brian Niccol : Thanks, Ashish. And good afternoon, everyone. We had a strong ending to 2019 as Q4 marks the eighth consecutive quarter of accelerating comparable sales, which highlights that running great restaurants with the right leaders and the right culture delivers outstanding performance. Our guests love what they see in our restaurants and our team members deserve all the credit. They are more passionate and committed than ever to delivering on our purpose of cultivating a better world. For the quarter, we reported sales of $1.4 billion, representing 17.6% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by 13.4% comparable restaurant sales growth that included 8% transactions growth. Restaurant level margins of 19.2% which is 220 basis points higher than last year. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $2.86 representing 66% year-over-year growth and digital sales growth of 78% year-over-year representing 19.6% of sales. Full-year results also showed great progress, with sales growing 14.8% to reach $5.6 billion, driven by an 11.1% comp with 7% transaction growth. Restaurant AUV, about $2.2 million, margin expansion of 180 basis points to 20.5% and digital sales of $1 billion dollars which grew 90% versus the prior year. These results were driven by the same five key fundamental strategies that I've mentioned previously. Number one, making the brand more visible and loved. Number two, creating innovations utilizing a stage gate process. Number three, leveraging our digital make line to expand access and convenience. Number four, engaging with customers through our loyalty program. And number five, running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food, hospitality, throughput and economics. While Chipotle had an excellent 2019, what excites me the most is that we are just getting started. I believe we have the opportunity to continue to expand AUVs, margins and store count over time. Our strategy has plenty of runway that should help drive healthy comps in 2020, while also improving flow through. Let me provide you an update on each of these strategies, beginning with our marketing programs which are designed to increase transactions and grow sales by driving culture, driving a difference and ultimately driving purchases. We continue to iterate our national For Real TV campaign to showcase our real ingredients, fresh food and the culinary skills of Chipotle team members in action. These ads are honest, transparent and highly effective at driving awareness and reminding customers what makes Chipotle great and a brand they love. This campaign is connecting with our customers as evidenced by significant increases across almost all major drivers of brand strength, including trust and favor brand in our consumer brand tracker. Our various marketing initiatives across both traditional and digital channels were successful in attracting new users to Chipotle as well as motivating existing customers to come more often. Importantly, we saw healthy transactions growth in 2019 without relying on short-term promotions.  Although our overall marketing budget relative to 2018 remained consistent at 3% of sales, the promo portion was actually reduced by 15% and follows a sizable reduction in 2018 as well. There's no doubt that marketing helped drive impressive sales during 2019. And based on the plans we have in place, I expect more of the same in 2020. Chipotle will continue to have a presence in national media where and when it makes sense. We will be a part of culturally relevant events and we have an always-on social and digital program. Our marketing efforts this year were elevated because we used the stage gate process to develop innovation that leads food culture and meets guest requests. We are pleased to have rolled out several successful menu items that were validated by this process.  This included our preconfigured, diet driven lifestyle bowls which were launched in January 2019 and received terrific feedback as they showed that whatever lifestyle or diet you want to pursue, Chipotle's real ingredients are a perfect fit. We recently enhanced this platform by adding a new super green salad mix composed of hand-cut romaine, baby kale and baby spinach, as well as a whole 30 chicken to provide guests with specific dietary goals, more options. The other noteworthy new item was carne asada, which was launched in September and will transition out by the end of the first quarter. This premium steak continues to exceed our expectations. As a result, our supply chain team is exploring options to see if we can add this as a permanent menu item at some point in the future, contingent, of course, on us finding enough supply of high quality ingredients that meet our food with integrity standards. As you think about 2020 and beyond, our goal is to continue introducing one to two new menu items on average per year. Our pipeline remains robust with Queso Blanco, quesadillas and beverages currently being tested in various markets. In fact, Queso Blanco has recently been validated via the stage gate process, allowing for a national rollout and replacement of our existing queso shortly. Additionally, we have several items in the early stages of testing. We will keep you updated on their progress over time.  The key takeaway here is that the state gate process is working as expected and gives me confidence that future innovations will delight our customers, ensure a seamless integration into our current operations and derive a financial benefit. Let's move now to the third key initiative. Our digital platform designed to reduce friction while increasing convenient access. The progress we've made here continues to be a standout story. Over the course of 2019, we significantly upgraded our capabilities by completing the rollout of digital pickup shelves, digitizing our digital make line and expanding our delivery capabilities to over 98% of our store base. During Q4, these efforts resulted in digital sales of $282 million, which grew 78% year-over-year and represented 19.6% of mix. In just three years, we have quadrupled the digital business, achieving over $1 billion in sales during 2019. Moving forward, I am really excited by the latest addition to our digital flywheel, the Chipotlane, which is off to a great start. Customers love the fact they don't have to get out of their cars, as well as having a pickup time that is significantly faster than their traditional drive-through. We continue to see overall digital penetration for Chipotle in restaurant in the high 20s, with the majority of this being driven by our highest margin, order ahead and pickup transaction. We will more than double the number of Chipotles in 2020 because our guests love the convenience and it strengthens our economic model by making our highest margin channel more accessible. The next potential piece to enhance our digital offering is a new restaurant design that helps evolve our mobile pickup shelves to an integrated digital pickup portal. We recently began to test several formats including one with a walk-up window across from Wrigley Field in Chicago. This 2,000 square-foot restaurant is slightly smaller, has fewer seats, the customer-facing grab-and-go beverage case and digital pickup shelves near the front door for easy access. By better suiting our restaurants to accommodate the digital business, we will be able to provide a better overall experience for our guests. Now that we have many of the digital tools in place, 2020 will be about using them more efficiently and really leveraging our rewards program, which currently has more than 8.5 million enrolled members and is one of the fastest growing restaurant loyalty programs in history. While in 2019, we focused on member growth. In 2020, we will not only further increase enrollment, but more importantly look to optimize the use of database marketing to incent behaviors as we build out our CRM capabilities. Personalization and engagement are the cornerstones of our revolving loyalty strategy. We are encouraged by the early signs of transaction increases across all frequency bands. We expect this lever to become a bigger driver in the future as we gain more experience gathering customer insight while continuing to expand our digital ecosystem. This brings me to the most foundational ingredient of having a successful restaurant company \u2013 operational excellence, which comes from great leaders building great teams who create equally great guest experiences. We continue to focus on outstanding execution by being brilliant at the basics. This requires a significant investment in our more than 83,000 employees with regard to career development as well as offering industry-leading benefits. Recent enhancements, such as debt free degrees, crew bonuses and mental health benefits, help differentiate the Chipotle brand. Nowadays, employees want more than just wages from a potential employer. They are seeking the right culture and the right skills to help them grow, both professionally and personally. Additionally, our purpose around Food With Integrity and cultivating a better world also provides us a competitive advantage in this tight labor market.  Within our restaurants, we believe the general manager is the most important position to improving operational health and ensuring a great customer experience. During 2019, this emphasis on our general managers resulted in exceptional food that is being prepared more consistently, better stability with turnover being reduced by around 35% and nearly a 10% improvement in our max 15 minute throughput KPI, aided by training and a laser focus on the five pillars of throughput.  This success reinforces that continuing to develop, grow and invest in our GMs is the right approach to creating an environment that allows our employees to be in a position to win, not only today, but also in the future. We've made good progress this year on our operational goals, but still have plenty of opportunity as we strive to be better today than we were yesterday, a message we will reinforce at our all-manager conference in March. In closing, I believe our strong performance this year highlights that our strategies are working and the Chipotle brand is thriving. I'm really proud of what we accomplished in 2019 and want to thank all of our employees for winning today and creating a bright future. We're building a successful, durable model. And by staying focused on our priorities and executing flawlessly, while providing customers with the unique Chipotle experience, I'm confident we will be successful for many years to come. With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials. Jack Hartung : Thanks, Brian. And good afternoon, everyone. Once again, we delivered outstanding financial performance in the fourth quarter as comps and margins continue to expand, highlighting our strong economic model. Sales were $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 17.6% from last year. Comp sales grew 13.4% in the quarter which includes no net impact from our rewards program. Deferred revenue from our rewards program was essentially offset by a refined breakage rate assumption for chips and guacamole as we gather more historical data. Moving forward, as we begin to lap the launch of our loyalty program, we expect quarterly deferrals to have a modest impact on our comp. Restaurant-level margins of 19.2% expanded 220 basis points over last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $2.86, representing 66% year-over-year of growth.  The fourth quarter had unusual expenses related to our transformation as well as legal reserves that negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.31, leading to a GAAP earnings per share of $2.55. For the full year, sales increased 14.8% to $5.6 billion on a comp increase of 11.1%. Restaurant level margins were 20.5%, an increase of 180 basis points, and we generated earnings per share adjusted for unusual expenses of $14.05, an increase of 55% over last year. Unusual expenses mostly related to transformation and legal reserves negatively impacted our earnings per share by $1.67, leading to GAAP earnings of $12.38. We're pleased that our unit economics strengthened in 2019 with average volumes now exceeding $2.2 million and restaurant margin reaching 20.5%. This margin included temporary pressure from carne asada and avocado pricing, without which our restaurant level margins would have been just over 21% which is within striking distance of the 22% margin potential at a $2.2 million AUV. The growth in AUVs and margins in 2019 is evidence that our strong economic model remains intact and we expect continued growth in both of these metrics during 2020 and beyond. The Q4 comp of 13.4% was driven by an acceleration in transaction as 8% of the comp came from greater guest visits. We also saw an increase in check of roughly 5.4%, driven by price and mix, the latter being driven by carne asada and digital orders which have a higher average check. Looking to fiscal 2020 where comparisons will no doubt be tougher, we're optimistic that based on healthy sales trends thus far in Q1, plus the 2% price increase taken in December, combined with our future growth initiatives that a mid-single digit comp is achievable for the full year. During the fourth quarter, we opened 80 new restaurants, a record number of openings for a quarter, bringing total new restaurant openings for the year to 140. Productivity of these units is in the high 80% range, the highest in the company's history. I'm really proud of the hard work put in by our development teams and our operations teams, especially given the significant back-end loading that occurred in 2019. We opened 46 Chipotlanes in the quarter, resulting in 66 Chipotlanes at year-end. And as Brian mentioned, we're excited by the early success of these Chipotlanes and we'll continue to aggressively open more moving forward. For 2020, we anticipate opening 150 to 165 new restaurants, with more than half including a Chipotlane. While these openings will once again be weighted towards the second half of the year, we expect a modestly better balance in comparison to last year. About 35% of these openings are expected to occur in the first half of 2020 versus only 25% in the first half of last year. Food costs for the quarter were 33.1%, a decrease of 10 basis point from last year due primarily to a venue price increase and lower avocado pricing that was partially offset by the higher cost of several other ingredients, including about 70 basis point headwind from carne asada as it was available for the entire quarter. On a sequential basis, avocado pricing continued to moderate, given greater supply coming from Mexico as we begin the more plentiful harvest year. For Q1, we expect ongoing moderation in avocado pricing as a result of increasing supply, but we believe this will be partially offset by higher carne asada cost, resulting in cost of sales being in the mid-32% range. We expect food cost for the full year to be in the low to mid 32% range based on better avocado pricing and further supply chain efficiencies being partially offset by what appears thus far to be a normal cycle of protein inflation. Labor costs for the quarter were 26.5%, a decrease of 60 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage, partially offset by labor inflation which continues to be in the 4% to 5% range including the cost of benefits such as debt free tuition. We expect Q1 labor costs to be in the mid 26% range with sales leverage and wage inflation being the biggest factors. Other operating costs for the quarter were 14.8%, a decrease of 70 basis points from 1Q4 last year due to sales leverage. Marketing and promo costs were 4.1% in the quarter, similar to Q4 of last year, but a 210 basis point increase sequentially to support carne asada and our free delivery bowl promotion. For the full year our marketing investment was 3% of sales as expected. Looking at 2020, we once again anticipate spending around 3% of sales overall for the year, with Q1 being in the low to mid 3% range compared to the 2.5% we spent in Q1 of last year in order to support our ongoing menu innovation. During the quarter, we booked $10 million for legal reserves related to US attorney's investigation that began in January 2016. This brings the total reserve to $25 million. We believe this amount is a reasonable estimate of what we may be expected to pay to settle this matter, but there can be no assurance that a settlement will be reached. We have been cooperating with the investigation and we're in active discussions to possibly resolve this matter. G&A for the quarter was $112 million on a GAAP basis, $106 million on a non-GAAP basis excluding nearly $4 million net related to several legal matters including the $10 million reserve I just mentioned and about $2 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also includes approximately $75 million in underlying G&A expenses, $25 million related to non-cash stock comp, $4.5 million related to higher bonus accruals from our strong performance and related payroll taxes and $1.5 million related to our upcoming all manager conference.  Underlying G&A was in line with our expectations as we grew headcount responsibly to support our growth. Looking to Q1, we expect to continue hiring people to support future growth and invest in our emerging digital platform. This will lead to Q1 underlying G&A support in the range of $77 million to $80 million and total G&A is expected to be around $120 million. We expect stock comp to be around $23 million per quarter, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance. This is slightly lower than Q4 as the 2017 equity bonuses roll off post testing and are replaced with new 2020 brands, which are valued at target without any performance.  We also expect to recognize between $3 million to $4 million of importer taxes associated with shares that vest at the beginning of our fiscal year. Lastly, we're expecting to recognize about $13 million of expenses in Q1 related to our upcoming all manager conference. Effective tax rate for Q4 was 28.3% on a GAAP basis and 27% on a non-GAAP basis. The difference was due primarily to tax implications related to transformation costs. For fiscal 2020, we expect our underlying effective tax rate to be in the 26% to 29% range, though it may vary based on discrete items as well as any stock option exercises.  Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and investments totaling $909 million as of December 31. And similar to Q3, we repurchased about $38 million of our stock at an average price of $773 per share during the quarter. For the full year, we repurchased $188 million at an average price of $684 per share. In closing, we're pleased to report a strong ending to fiscal 2019, including 8% transaction growth which highlights that our strategies are resonating not only with high-frequency customers, but also with medium frequency and new customers. Continuing to enhance convenience and access while optimizing our digital, marketing, menu and operations will help ensure the Chipotle brand remains healthy moving forward.  Thank you to all of our employees for their hard work and their dedication this year and let's keep it going in 2020. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question will come from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi. Good afternoon and congratulations on a strong year. My question, Jack, is about the margin performance at the restaurant level. I'm just wondering if you could comment on the flow-through that you saw in Q4 and throughout the year. And I think you mentioned that, at $2.2 million AUV, the expectation would be that you have margins in the 22% range and you're a bit below that. So, can you reconcile some of the factors that are driving that and what the algorithm might look like going forward as you grow the unit volumes? Jack Hartung : Yeah, David. First of all, we still think that the margin potential at $2.2 million is right around 22%. There are a couple of things that were headwinds during the year. One, we saw some really, really high avocado cost during the summer. That had an impact. And then, we also had carne asada, which, I think, as you know, for most of the quarter, we priced carne asada at just $0.50 above steak and it cost us about $0.35 to $0.40 or so. And we did that intentionally as a transaction builder, but it did have a temporary negative impact on our margin. Now, during the quarter, we did take a price increase. We increased carne asada another $0.25. We got a $0.75 upcharge and we didn't see any degradation in demand at all. So, we think there is room when we do additional premium offerings like that we can price them at full margin.  The other thing that's going on, David, that also had what I would call temporary headwinds is, we just started our loyalty program last year. We did a great job of acquiring well over 8 million customers in the program. With that acquisition comes the discounts, and yet we hadn't really monetized that [indiscernible]. So, that has a little bit of an impact on the margin as well. And then, our delivery business is growing well also. So, all these things are what I would call temporary or cyclical headwinds that we can overcome all of them and we still feel confident that, when we get to $2.2 million, we can generate a 22% margin. We get to $2.3 million, we could generate a 23% margin. We think that potential still exists within the model. David Tarantino : Thank you. Operator : And the next question will come from Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Please go ahead, Nicole. Perhaps your line is muted on your end. All right. We'll move to our next question. That's Katie Fogertey with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Katherine Fogertey : Great. Thank you. I have a couple of questions here. So, first of all, with the \u2013 bringing the super greens on to the menu in January and kind of expanding the lifestyle bowl offerings that you did in 4Q. Can you give us a sense of how your bowl versus burrito mix is changing here and how that is evolving and any kind color that you can give us on labor and margin efficiencies as you move to the bowl away from the burrito? And I have a follow-up. Brian Niccol : Sure. The reality is continues to show a slight migration to bowls. The thing that's great about that is that's our fastest product on the Chipotle menu and which also provides, I think, the customer the greatest value proposition because of all the customization that they see right in front of them, with all our ingredients right in front of them. So, the good news is the super greens proposition has been well received. It's performing in line with expectations and the customer feedback on it has all been very positive. So, it's perfectly in sync. And I think we talked about this earlier. One of the things we heard early on from our customer was they would like us to improve our salad and that's what we're doing with the super greens salad mix. Katherine Fogertey : Great. That's helpful. And do you have a sense of the mix of the bowls versus burritos? Brian Niccol : Rule of thumb is two-thirds bowls is the way to think about it. And then, the next piece is burritos followed by tacos. Tacos are small. Katherine Fogertey : Okay. And then, on the delivery cost side, we're seeing more and more restaurants pass on the delivery cost to the customer and not seeing really any kind of impact to demand. You kind of talked about having some room to move on carne asada and not seeing any traffic hit there. Is that a potential opportunity for this year for you guys to pass on some of the delivery cost to the customer? Brian Niccol : Yeah. Look, the good news is our value equation is really strong at Chipotle. So, we have room if we find that the economic proposition requires us to pass along some of these costs in the delivery channel. Or if we want to bring out some elevated ingredients. The good news is our value proposition is really strong and the elasticity would allow us to do it. Currently, we like the economics that we have and we're more in the mortgage acquisition mode of using delivery as a tool to get people into our digital ecosystem. So, the good news is we've got the right value proposition that if we wanted to flex it, we could. Katherine Fogertey : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : Next question, we'll move back to Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Nicole Miller Regan : Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay now? Brian Niccol : Yeah. Nicole Miller Regan : I apologize for that earlier. I wanted to ask about how you think about directing the balance sheet. So, when we look back on last year, clearly, was better at every quarter versus where you started guiding the year, what the Street expected. So, maybe some of the things that you didn't do. So, not necessarily an acceleration in development. How do you view that as a use of cash? The share repurchase hasn't necessarily increased and would you use leverage? And then, when might a dividend be appropriate? Thank you. Jack Hartung : Yeah, Nicole. Let me start with buybacks. We bought, I think, like $168 million during the year, $38 million during the quarter. Our cash balance did grow during the fourth quarter. We actually suspended our buys during the quarter for a while as we got into serious negotiations with the government. Our counsel advised us to suspend that for a while. With this release, we'll be able to get back in the market. And so, I think what you'll see is we will be opportunistic as we look at the share price and we look at our balance sheet just to do buybacks at the appropriate level. In terms of investing in return-generating assets, the best investment we can make is into our Chipotle restaurants. And I would not expect us to see \u2013 to do a stair-step increase in the opening, but you will see an increase over time. Our pipeline is building very, very nicely. And that's going to be a great return for us. We're also going to dabble in remodel this year as well. So, we've got several hundred restaurants that needed refresh, so that they're more digital forward. So, we're going to experiment with that. And if that goes well, which we're optimistic about, that will be another opportunity for us and I would expect that would be a return generating asset as well. We from time to time, Nicole, talk about dividends, but it's not really on the radar screen right now. We think that we're more in growth mode and opportunistic buyback of our stock and not dividend generating. That might change in the future, but right now we're not considering a dividend. Brian Niccol : The only thing I would add is we have a billion-dollar digital business that continues to grow nicely. And where we see opportunities to invest and continuing to push the digital access in our business, we're going to do that because it makes a lot of sense for both performance today and performance in the future. Nicole Miller Regan : And just a follow-up, what's the practice on leverage? How do you feel about it? Would you deploy it? Jack Hartung : No. Nicole, that's financial engineering. That's something that I think is more appropriate for a more mature slow-growing company. So, I would not expect us to put leverage on the balance sheet. Nicole Miller Regan : Excellent. Thank you. Jack Hartung : Thanks, Nicole. Operator : And our next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Sara Senatore : Thank you. I have one question and one follow-up please. First on just menu innovation, you talked about the super greens performing in line with expectations. But if I think about carne asada, I think it's probably exceeded expectations, which is why you are bringing it back permanently and maybe was, we'd estimate, maybe much of a mid-single-digit mix or lift. So, how should we think about menu innovation going forward? Is that sort of a unique experience and we wouldn't expect to see these kinds of big hits or is it just that you could have more opportunities that would be as meaningful? And then, I have a follow-up please. Brian Niccol : So, actually, we're really delighted with the carne asada performance. It's evidence that are our stage gate process towards innovation really is working. The thing that was great about carne asada is we stay true to our principles around Food With Integrity and bringing out great quality meat. And when the customers got to try it, they loved it and they came back for more. So, we're working right now to figure out, can we get a supply, so that we could make it permanent. And if we can secure that supply, then we probably make it permanent. But we haven't been able to finalize that point yet. So, customers loved it. The performance was great. As we figure out our supply scenario on this, we'll figure out the right time to bring it back. And if we can, we'll figure out a way to make it permanent. 's: And Queso Blanco is the most recent product that's gone through our stage gate process that now we are ready to bring this to market and replace our existing queso. I think we've mentioned we've been working on quesadillas and some beverages. So, the thing that's great is, I think we've got a cadence that's building. And as I mentioned before, we're not going to be moving to a place where we are doing something every 4 to 6 weeks. That's not our business. That's not who we are. You can expect us to do one or two of these initiatives on the menu because it's the right cadence for operators to execute really well and it's also the right cadence I think to give our customers the variety that they're looking for in our business. So, I love what's happening in our menu. And I love what's happening in our pipeline. And I think this stage gate process is proving to be a very effective tool. Sara Senatore : Okay, great. Thank you. And then, my follow-up is just, I think in terms of the guidance, mid-single-digit comp. I think, Jack, historically, you've kind of guided to whatever the current run rate of volume that you're not assuming much of an acceleration. But is it safe to say that quarter-to-date you're still seeing kind of low double-digit comps? That would be the implication I think if I... Jack Hartung : Yeah. The way I would say that, Sara, is that these dollar sales that we saw in the fourth quarter continued into the first quarter, but the comparison is different. So, yeah, the comps are strong. Just keep in mind, we'll have to compare to our 13.4% in the fourth quarter of next year. And then, when we run through the carne asada, we'll lose some check as well. The carne asada added about 150 basis points to the average check, so we'll see that as well. We're optimistic we'll keep all those transactions, but that will have a bit of an impact. Brian Niccol : The only thing I would add to that is, we mentioned that the brand has got, I think, really excellent momentum. And I tried to highlight that in the script by talking about how we've seen trust and favored brand metrics really move forward.  And so, I just want to make sure people understand. I think the reason why we had the quarter that we had is not because we had carne asada, and it was just one thing that drove this business. I really do believe our operations are running better than they ever have been. We saw an opportunity to be even better. But our operations are running better. They're running faster. The food is more consistent. We have lower turnover. And I think we've got better execution. If you think about all the progress on digital and then I think the progress we've made on allocating our marketing dollars, so that it is driving purchases without using discounting as the crutch. And then, obviously, layered on top, we had a nice menu innovation on carne asada. So, I just want to make sure people understand it's not a one trick here on why we've got 8 points of transaction growth and a 13.4% comp as a result of it. Operator : The next question will come from Andrew Charles with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles : Great. Thank you. Brian, you mentioned during the quarter an openness to work with other third-party delivery providers beyond the national partnership you have with DoorDash and also the agreement you have in place with Postmates. I'm curious, what would lead you to pursue working with other delivery providers? As well as, does your agreement with DoorDash indicate you would see higher commissions if you were to onboard another delivery partner? And then, I also have a follow-up for Jack. Brian Niccol : Okay. Yeah, look, I think the reason why I said we're going to be open to it is, at the end of the day, we've got to give access to our customers where they want Chipotle, when they want Chipotle and how they want Chipotle. And I think the delivery channel is proving to be one of those access points. The relationship with DoorDash has been great. Working with Postmates has been great. We'll see how things unfold going forward. But I do think ultimately the delivery marketplace is not going to be an exclusive proposition. I think the delivery marketplace is going to be about giving customers access accordingly. So, we're continuing to talk to all the players. And when the right opportunity presents itself, we'll figure out whether or not we bring on additional players or not. But, yeah, we're open to it. And the real driver of it is we want to deliver on the needs of our customers. Andrew Charles : Sure. And then, Jack, beyond if you would see a higher commission from DoorDash if you were to onboard another provider, looking at labor, it looks like labor dollars per store growth accelerated quite a bit. Our model is just about 10% growth, which is well in excess of the 4% to 5% labor inflation you called out despite the accelerated digital growth which is obviously more favorable for labor. What do you attribute this acceleration to? Is it the incremental benefits? Is it the greater number of crew members to handle the greater traffic? Just curious, for modeling purposes, how we should think about labor in 2020? Jack Hartung : Yeah, it's traffic driven. So, if you just take a standard 10% increase in labor when we have 8% \u2013 keep in mind, we have 8% in terms of transactions, but we also had mix which means we're cooking more food as well. So, we only had a 2% price increase. So, the rest is more food, more customers that we're serving. It does take more labor. And so, our labor is more partially fixed, partially variable. Frankly, during the quarter, our labor performed the way that it should have. We saw 60 basis points of leverage even though we had about 140 basis points of inflation and then benefit headwind. So, we had to come up with couple of hundred basis points of leverage based on the price increase and based on the higher transaction. We also during the fourth quarter \u2013 keep in mind, we opened up a record number of restaurants. And so, that's another piece where, just with that alone, you're going to add labor, not just to staff the 80 restaurants, but we also have to train those folks before the restaurants open. And we tend to have an allocation or allowance for more labor hours early on in the first week or the first several weeks because people are learning and we don't know exactly what the sales are. So, there's a number of things why you see higher labor in the fourth quarter. Andrew Charles : Thanks. Operator : And the next question is from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. And congrats on a great year. Interesting that your digital mix increased by 7 points in that fourth quarter. Your same-store sales growth was obviously a lot higher at over 13%. So, you can see how the new product news is letting you not lean as hard on delivery and digital order growth to drive the comp. Looking into this year, how do you see your growth contribution going forward? You mentioned a new product. But then again, you're also talking about ways to engage that loyalty member. And I have a quick follow-up. Brian Niccol : Yeah, David. So, the way we're thinking about it is, marketing, combined with our CRM is a real opportunity to grow the business both with new users and existing users. And then, as we think about our digital business, one of the things that I'm really excited about is our order ahead business, as we continue to get people into our digital system, they really see the benefits of, one, joining the rewards program, but, two, just the convenience, the ease of access by using whether it's the website or the app. So, we believe there's going to be continued growth there.  And then, obviously, I continue to believe that there is more growth just running our restaurants better. As we continue to improve on our throughput, that just basically continues to be a multiply effect, right? It's like, carne asada, the digital business, none of it will be nearly as effective if we don't have strong execution on the basics with our restaurant. So, I feel like every one of these calls, people are always like, what was the one thing and what's the one thing to drive comp going forward. I really continue to believe the strategies that we've outlined all contribute to our ongoing growth model. And we've got lease on \u2013 some will provide more at certain times of the year and others will provide more at other times of the year. But, in the end, that's why we had the year that we had, and that's why I believe we'll continue to perform going forward. David Palmer : The quick follow-up on that is related to, I think, a conception that going into this year, you're going to be lapping free delivery windows. And you've done those margin dilutive ways to onboard consumers. And I guess the question I would have is, once you have them on board, I think you said 8 million strong, how do you convert them into more digital users? Or you feel like you can maybe have your cake and eat it too with margins and sales as you grow that digital user base? And I'll pass it on. Brian Niccol : Yeah, yeah. Look, David, obviously, what you just articulated is how we want this to play out where we continue to invest to grow the database. The good news is, I think, going forward, it's going to be more balanced between invest in acquisition as well as kind of driving behavioral changes. And, as our digital business continues to grow, as Chipotlanes become more prevalent, we think there is opportunity for us to become even more efficient in how we provide people that great Chipotle experience. The one thing I would mention is, Jack said this at the very beginning, the bottom line is, we hold ourselves accountable to make the economic model consistent with what we've been talking about. You get to $2.5 million, we'll have 25% margins. And we think we see a clear sight of path on how that all happens through a combination of initiatives, and then just being really, I think, smart about how we manage the P&L accordingly. So, it's a great situation to be in where we've invested. And now, we are going to be able to take advantage of those investments in the digital space. But I think it also plays out in a lot of different ways that people access the Chipotle brand. So, obviously, we're very proud of where we are, but I'm really excited about where we're going, is kind of the summary. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Lauren Silberman : Thanks. I wanted to ask about the loyalty program. So, now at the 8.5 million members less than a year after launching, what do you think makes Chipotle different than maybe some of the competitors as it relates to customer acquisition? And thinking about the trajectory of membership growth going forward, any color on kind of when you start to turn on more of the personalized marketing? Brian Niccol : Yeah. Look, I think, Chipotle is a unique restaurant company. And any time we have found that we provide people the ability to have more engagement or more access, they want to be a part of that. And I think that's why the rewards program has had such quick adoption. I think it's a testament to the fact that we are committed to Food With Integrity, we've got a great value proposition, all the reasons why you love Chipotle. Okay? Now, the thing that's great is we have 8.5 million customers and the personalization really is just getting started. So, I'm already seeing some of our tactics going to the marketplace. And what's great to see is we're seeing it have an effect on just about every cohort that we're targeting. And we define those cohorts both on purchase frequency as well as, I would call it, lifestyle.  And so, I think it's going to continue to be something we're going to want to invest to continue to grow. But at the same time, we're now taking that universe and really using it as a smart way to grow the business. And it's a hugely valuable asset and it's an asset we're going to really drive going forward. Lauren Silberman : Great. Just a follow-up to the digital sales growth. I think there is a perception that the majority is coming from deliveries, but the customers don't see the third-party platforms. Are there opportunities to convert them to the Chipotle digital ecosystem? Brian Niccol : Yeah. I would tell you that's a little bit of a misconception. The thing that's great is, as we see people come into the digital system, we see really nice gains in our order ahead business. So, in the early days, obviously, delivery was on 8% growth rate, was one of the biggest parts of our digital business. But one of the things I'm really excited about is the progress we're making on the order ahead business. And delivery is proving to be just a great experience for people that maybe didn't have that occasion with Chipotle in the past. Now, they believe it's convenient, so they can have those occasions with Chipotle, both order ahead as well as delivery. So, it's working nicely as a system between rewards, order ahead, delivery and now the Chipotlane. Lauren Silberman : Great. Thank you. Brian Niccol : Sure. Operator : The next question is from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please go ahead. Peter Saleh : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the second make line. The second make line is digitized. The second make line is now in all the stores. Digital sales are now approaching 20%. So, are you starting to see some leverage on that second make line? Is there anything noticeable? Any which way that you guys can break out the contribution that you're seeing from our second make line now? Brian Niccol : Look, I think we're going to be very smart about how we take advantage of that efficiency. Our most important thing right now is we want to give people a great digital experience. That's why we've invested in those digital make lines, we've invested in the \u2013 we're calling that \u2013 the digital portal pickup.  The thing that's great is, we know the efficiency is there and we're going to be smart about how we implement that efficiency into the business, so that we don't affect our growth and/or the experience that the customer has. So, we're delighted that we're closing in on 20%. But that's not the end of this journey. That's just one of the stops on our journey to, I think, a much bigger business than where we are today. Peter Saleh : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Jake Bartlett with SunTrust. Jake Bartlett : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. My first one is on throughput. You mentioned an improvement in the peak hour throughput. I think you said 10% or maybe it's 10 seconds. Maybe I misheard. But if you could just remind us what that was and where you are in terms of throughput versus the kind of the low of your throughput. Trying to see how much you've improved since that low and maybe when that low was. Brian Niccol : Yes. So, the 10% improvement is what I said. But, yeah, I think we talked about this as \u2013 at our peak, we're doing low 30s, mid 30s and the max 15. And unfortunately, that dropped to kind of the low 20s, mid 20s. And what I'm happy to say is, Scott and the team have really put a lot of focus on how do we get back to great throughput. And the more we have stability in the restaurants, the more we have consistency in our KPIs and what we're going to hold our teams accountable for, I think we'll continue to see this metric improve which just provides a better experience for our customer. But the way to think about it is we've had about a 10% improvement. And what I'm happy to say is, as we've moved into 2020, we continue to see the improvement. So, this is one of those things that builds on top of itself. And if you were to talk to any of our team members, they would all know throughput is a key pillar as well as having great food, great teams and having those restaurant staffed correctly. So, I'm really optimistic about where operations are going to take this metric going forward. Jake Bartlett : Great. I think of throughput as a key sales driver, but it also could be a cost savings. Is throughput part of what you talked about in your prepared script around just flow-through \u2013 better flow-through of profits in 2020? Is that going to contribute to kind of keep labor in check? Brian Niccol : Yeah. It's part of it. The flow-through I'm referring to is kind of where Jack started this conversation in regard to \u2013 look, for every incremental dollar, we expect X% to flow to the bottom line. And then, that's how we hold the model consistent, so that when we do get to $2.5 million, we'll have 25% margins or better. So, it's not just one thing, but obviously that's a key indicator that we're running the restaurants correctly. You're not running the restaurants correctly if we're not going fast. And so, one thing we do know is a busy restaurant, a restaurant that's running quick is a well-run restaurant. The team members prefer working in that environment and the customers prefer getting their food in that environment. So, all really good stuff. Jake Bartlett : Great. And then, Jack, last question on G&A. You mentioned this kind of the underlying G&A and the guidance for the first quarter, I think you said $77 million to $80 million, if I got that right. That to me is up \u2013 it looks, versus the first quarter of last year, up about 9%, 10%. Is that the right run rate just in terms of the underlying G&A, that underlying G&A should grow that quickly. I was kind of more under the impression that you could kind of keep a mid-single-digit G&A growth longer-term. Jack Hartung : I think that's right. Over the long term, I think that's about right. We started the transformation in this move about a year-and-a-half ago. And so, there's a few gaps that we need to fill. And so, that's why we want to make sure you guys saw what we are doing into the first quarter. So, I think more of a mid-single digit-ish in terms of underlying G&A. So, we will grow our G&A at a less than the sales rate, so we can leverage it. So, I think that's correct to think about it long-term. But keep in mind, as Brian mentioned, we're in the early days of digital. So, some of these resources \u2013 a lot of these resource, in fact, are making sure that we've got the right skill gaps, whether it comes to digital, whether it comes to some of the CRM and things like that. And so, we want to make sure we get ahead of those. But I think over a longer period of time, I think something more in that kind of mid-single-digit as opposed to a high single-digit is probably a good way to think about it. Jake Bartlett : Okay. And just to be clear. The first quarter should be higher than the rest of the year, should be more in line with the long-term or the whole year is kind of a year of investment? Jack Hartung : Well, the whole year is going to be up because we're going to hire people and then they're going to be into the base. Jake Bartlett : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thanks. Brian, you talked about employee benefits and initiatives, kind of how that's been translating into operational excellence. Just kind of wondering if you could talk a bit more about building the talent pool, what that's meant for the quality of restaurants. Looking ahead, in particular, as you \u2013 I don't know if you still frame it as far as a restaurant, et cetera. Just the progress that you've made there on the restaurant pool.  And then, just going one step further, thinking a little longer term around restaurant development, it feels like this has always kind of been the limiting factor from an employee talent perspective. Just how you're thinking about those benchmarks from a talent perspective to where you can kind of see a step change looking ahead from a store growth perspective? Thanks. Brian Niccol : Sure, sure. So, look, I'll give you a little bit of example to bring to light the progress that I think we're making on the restaurant. So, I was actually in Denver just a couple of weeks ago. And Denver is one of our older markets. And I was visiting with our team director there, Alfredo Ponce, and he has got just terrific restaurant general managers. And this one young lady who is running one of our restaurants, she's had three consecutive quarters where she hit all the KPIs and her and her entire crew have all gotten bonuses. And she is on her way in the fourth \u2013 the first quarter, but she \u2013 she just walked in there, she's like \u2013 she wanted to show me her AB scorecard. It was all green, it was As everywhere. And the first thing she told me is like we're going to get our fourth quarter in a row of accrued bonus. And every one of those employees had a smile on their face. They were truly energized, truly engaged. And I give that just as one example of what I see as I now travel more and more across the country. Whether you're in Arizona, Boston, New York, we're seeing our team members I think just be more energized, more engaged and just super-proud of making a difference. It's hard to put a value on that. As part of this process, though, we ask them what does more support look like for you to be successful at Chipotle. And what they came back with is, look, tuition reimbursement is great, but I actually need a debt free program, like I need a program where I don't put myself in a place where I'm behind the eight ball and that's why we came up with the debt free degree program. We also heard loud and clear from a lot of young people mental health is top of mind for not only them, but their family. And so, we brought forward those benefits. So, English as a second language is something also too where people are like, hey, it's great to have a benefit for me, but it would be great if I could have for my whole family. The reason why this is important is we want the employee to feel great about working there, but we want those around them to feel great about them working at Chipotle as well. And I think we're seeing the impact of that.  And we're going to continue to fine-tune the benefits. We're going to continue fine-tuning the employee value proposition. But my goal and our team's goal is, we want people to believe and experience that when they work at Chipotle, they get to be themselves, they will get to grow professionally and they will get to grow personally. And I think if we do that, we'll continue to attract the right people and we'll get much better outcomes than if we didn't have all these things in place to attract these types of people. So, it's one of the plays that I'm usually passionate about and it makes you get really excited when you see it happening in our restaurants. Dennis Geiger : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John Glass : Thanks very much. First, just on the loyalty and program enhancements, Brian, that you're planning, how much work has been done? Are you ready to do sort of phase two and do more bespoke offers? Or is there more work behind the scenes that you need to do before you can do that? I know it's easier said than done. And when should we expect those more bespoke or personalized offers to start appearing? Brian Niccol : Yeah, John. Great question. The bespoke or more personalized offers have begun. We're kind of rolling right now with it. So, it's going to be happening all year long, and I think as every week goes by, we're only going to get better at it. And I'm really \u2013 it's nice to see the work that's been done over the last year start to come to fruition in 2020. John Glass : All right. And then, Jack, just two margin questions. One is, you didn't mention in the labor commentary the cost of the bonus program. Can you just quantify what that may have been? I assume that's entirely variable, right? So, if comps were to moderate, some of that bonus goes away, so we shouldn't worry about labor dollars per store growth. It's going to be relative to comp growth. Is that fair as it relates to that bonus? Jack Hartung : Yeah. We're not breaking out the dollar amount, John. I would put that into the category of the 4% to 5% inflation. That's the piece where I mentioned we have about 140 basis points of headwind in labor. So, that includes normal wage inflation, includes debt less degrees and includes the bonus program, all these things that Brian mentioned. Those are all in that. And I know that doesn't technically qualify as wage inflation, the way that you might think about it, but these are all things we're doing to make sure that we have the best workforce we can and that we engage them and that we keep them. So, that's all included in that number. And I wouldn't think of it as 100% variable, John, because there is qualitative figures in there as well. Sure, when sales are good, that means the margin is going to be good. And so, they'll be hitting those metrics, those other metrics as well that aren't as direct. So, I would call it semi-variable. So, generally, it's going to be tougher to earn the bonus. We don't have very strong sales, very strong margins, but it's not 100% variable to sales. John Glass : Okay. And then, just finally, you mentioned there may be a modest impact to comp on the loyalty program or deferred benefits. What does modest mean? How big could that drag be? Jack Hartung : We had seen 30 and 40 basis points early last year, John. And as we've seen the program mature a little bit and people have earned their rewards, they're redeeming them and the redemptions are now offsetting the deferrals. And so, it will be, we think, in most quarters, it's going to be less than it was early last year when it was in the 30 basis points, 40 basis points. So, like this past quarter, because we also made a little adjustment on our breakage rate on chips and guac, there was no net impact. And so, I think in the future, it's either going to be very little to no net impact. John Glass : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And the next question will come from Chris Carril with RBC. Please go ahead. Christopher Carril : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So, you noted the very strong productivity of recent openings. And I think they were described as the highest in company history. I know you mentioned earlier in the context of investment that we shouldn't expect large accelerations in openings. But given these really strong productivity results, does this potentially shift your thinking incrementally at all on development in the near to medium term? Brian Niccol : Yeah. So, I think we've been sharing this with you guys is, the economic model and the availability of sites for Chipotle continues to be a huge opportunity. And we increased obviously what we're going to build in 2020, and I think we're going to continue \u2013 you're going to continue to see us I think accelerate that into the future years for two reasons. One, the economics support it, the customers want it. And then, the second key piece is, I think we now have our operations in a place where we're developing leaders to be ready to take over those restaurants. So, we want to be smart about how we continue to move forward on adding new units. The good news is the returns continue to be great. Our operations are running better. Our people development is in a much better place, and I think it sets the stage for us nicely to continue to grow from where we are right now. So, I see a future where we could get back to the 200 plus restaurants. It's just not going to happen this year. Christopher Carril : Great. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Brian Niccol : All right. Thanks. And thanks, everybody, for taking the time. Obviously, very proud of Chipotle for delivering what was a great 2019. I think we touched on each of our key strategies.  The thing I just want to emphasize, everybody, is I believe you don't get these results without developing the right culture and the right people and I think that's happening in all facets of our business, whether it's operations, marketing, digital, HR, public affairs. I do believe we are building out a team that has world-class leaders in all aspects of this company, and those leaders are building a strong culture that's focused on cultivating a better world and developing future leaders, so that these strategies that I believe have a tremendous runway of growth can be executed flawlessly. So, I do want to say thank you to everybody for a terrific 2019. But as we mentioned earlier, these strategies are not just about 2019. They're about 2020 and well beyond. And we're confident Chipotle is going to continue to be a unique brand that provides a unique experience that will continue to drive and attract great people and a great culture. So, thanks for listening and we'll talk to you in a quarter. Thanks. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ashish Kohli : Hello everyone and welcome to our first quarter 2020 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain states and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, our Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian. Brian Niccol : Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon everyone. We hope everyone is doing well and staying safe during this unprecedented time. Given the circumstances, we will discuss Q1 results and recent trends in a few minutes, but I want to start by updating you on our response to COVID-19 and its impact on our business. Let me say upfront how proud and grateful I am to all our employees for their positive attitude and efforts in providing guests access to our safe, delicious, high-quality food made from real ingredients. I want to thank our supply chain partners who have been dedicated to keeping our restaurants stocked with gloves, hand sanitizer, masks, and other necessary items to keep our employees, food, and customers safe. I also want to thank our supply chain partners who\u2019ve delivered our food with integrity ingredients to every open Chipotle restaurant during these challenging times in a healthy and safe way. As a result, I am pleased to report that only about 100 restaurants are fully closed at this time. These are mainly inside malls and shopping centers as well as 17 locations in Europe, while the rest of our restaurants remain open for to go and digital order ahead and delivery services, which is critical at a time where food options are limited. Cultivating a better world takes commitment from all of us, and we are fortunate to have the financial strength to weather this storm. Jack will provide more details, but it's important to note that we remain focused on conserving cash while prudently continuing to invest in several areas that will help us show a strong recovery once guest activity begins to normalize. Specifically, I want to focus my discussion on three key topics. One, our efforts to take care of our employees, guest, and communities; two, our emerging digital platform; and three, our recent comp trends. At Chipotle, investing in our people has always been the top priority. After all, they are our greatest asset. Well before COVID-19, we had industry-leading benefits for all employees that include free meals, paid sick leave, crew bonuses, and debt-free degrees as well as mental health benefits and access to a health care concierge service for all employees and their families. In the weeks since our world quickly changed, we continue to find ways to support our employees personally and financially. We expressed our appreciation for restaurant employees who are willing and able to continue work between March 16th and May 10th with assistance Pay, a 10% increase in hourly rates. We approved discretionary Q1 bonuses of nearly $7 million to field leaders, general managers, apprentices and eligible hourly employees. We're also providing an additional $2 million in assistance bonuses to general managers and apprentices for their services in April, and we expanded our emergency lead benefits to accommodate those directly affected by COVID-19. Beyond these benefits, we are working diligently to ensure that we're doing everything possible to keep our guests and employees safe during this time of uncertainty. At Chipotle, food safety is more than a collection of programs and processes. It's part of our DNA. We have a culture of continuous improvement, in which we regularly evaluate our processes to ensure that our customers have consistently excellent experiences. Over the past few years, we strengthened many of our food safety initiatives, including, wellness checks done before every shift and trained nurses available to evaluate any employee who may feel ill in order to determine whether they should be excluded from work with full pay, installed advanced technology air purification systems to reduce the risk of viruses, supplied Purell sanitizer for employees and guests, mandated handwashing between tasks and at least every hour as well as gloves being won for all tasks, enhanced food preparation and food handling practices designed to reduce food safety risks, improved internal training and education to ensure that all employees thoroughly understand the company's high standards for food safety and food handling, engaged a third-party consultant to perform regular inspections of all restaurants, and finally, creating an independent food safety advisory council comprised of food safety experts to provide ongoing guidance on best practices. More recently, as the cases of coronavirus started to grow in the U.S., we formed a cross-functional task force that has been holding daily calls. This provides a real-time platform for us to stay current with market trends, regulations and mandates on COVID-19 based on feedback from the CDC, FDA, state and local agencies, as well as ensuring we get frequent updates on our own operations. This is also allowing us to make quick decisions and navigate these evolving circumstances, including recent additional precautions to safeguard our employees and guests. These include increased sanitization of high-touch, high-traffic areas, providing masks for employees and a tamper-evident packaging seal. Customers can leave instructions in our app and online to request contactless deliveries and carryout. All of these initiatives give our employees and customers' confidence that Chipotle remains steadfast in our commitment to keeping them safe. We are also doing our part for the community by donating excess food daily to various food banks. We're celebrating National Burrito Day by thanking healthcare heroes with 100,000 free burritos and offering a new gift card program that supports healthcare workers on the front lines. Chipotle will be donating 10% to Direct Impact an organization working to provide personal protective equipment and essential medical items to healthcare workers through May 31st. In addition, Chipotle is doing a buy one, give one offer for burritos, whereby, Chipotle will donate one burrito to a healthcare worker for every one purchased digitally from April 21st through April 26th, as we continue to support those on the front lines of this crisis. As I mentioned earlier, the majority of our restaurants are open for to-go orders, which is allowing us to successfully leverage the digital platform we put in place over the past two years. Q1 digital sales grew 81% year-over-year to $372 million. Our highest ever quarterly level, and represented 26.3% of sales. As people started to implement social distancing, we moved swiftly by driving further investments towards digital and delivery designed to reduce friction, while increasing convenient access. Although Queso Blanco is off to a terrific start, we reprioritized our marketing efforts by offering free delivery from March 15 to at least early May and shifted from live sports to more online and streaming platforms. We also announced a successful national delivery partnership with Uber Eats that is helping drive new customers and greater frequency. Collectively, these decisions translated into strong engagement with our guests as evidenced by our March digital sales growing 103% year-over-year and representing 37.6% of sales. A recent survey among current Chipotle consumers suggest that about 15% had Chipoltle delivered for the first time during the last 2 weeks of March based on their desire for fresh ingredients, craveable taste and good value. We believe this will have a lasting benefit well beyond the current crisis and are pleased to report that we have maintained strong momentum into April with the month-to-date digital mix running in the high 60s. While, delivery continues to be the fastest-growing part of our digital platform, we are also pleased with our order ahead business, where average daily sales have doubled from the level seen prior to COVID. This is part of the reason that we continue to shift our development pipeline more aggressively towards Chipotlanes, as it helps drive our high-margin digital order ahead transaction. Another element that is benefiting from the current environment is our rewards program which now has more than 11.5 million enrolled members. Over the past month, daily sign-ups spike nearly fourfold, which is another sign that our digital platform is gaining traction. We are pleased to report that 65% of newly-enrolled rewards members are new to the Chipotle brand, up from 51% pre-COVID. In addition, 61% of previously store-only rewards members are now new to digital versus 8% pre-COVID. While it's early days, we are starting to leverage this growing install base with personalized promotions to better engage and intent behavior. We are seeing modest transaction increases across all frequency bands and expect this lever to become a bigger driver in the future as we gain greater customer insights while continuing to expand our digital ecosystem. Lastly, let me provide a few comments on trends during the quarter and thus far, in April. Despite lapping a 9.9% comp in Q1, 2019 we had a tremendous start to 2020 with our comps running at plus 14.4% with nearly 11% transaction growth through the end of February, including a 2% benefit for leap year. This highlights that our 5 key strategies continue to resonate with guests. And as a reminder, these are : making the brand visible and loved; creating innovations; utilizing a stage gate process; leveraging our digital make line to expand access and convenience; engaging with customers through our loyalty program; and running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food, hospitality, throughput and economics. We began March on a very positive note, but as COVID-19 restrictions became more prevalent, our comps deteriorated and ended up declining 16% for the month, with the week ending March 29 being the trough at down 35%. This resulted in the Q1 comp being up 3.3%, with transactions down 1.4%, including a 1.3% leap day benefit. Restaurant level margins were 17.6% and adjusted diluted EPS was $3.08, down 9% year-over-year. April has seen our comps improve with the most recent week adjusted for Easter being in the negative high teens range. No one can predict the magnitude or duration of this crisis, but we are focused on winning today, while we cultivate a bright future for our employees, guests, communities and shareholders. By staying calm and working collaboratively to leverage our strong brand, business model and balance sheet, we are confident in our ability to get through the current downturn. In fact, we are continuing to judiciously invest in key areas of our business so that when we come out the other side, we will emerge even stronger. We know it won't be easy, but Chipotle is well prepared to regain our prior momentum and expand our brand leadership. A recent consumer survey showed that the vast majority of our pre-coronavirus consumers envision coming back to the restaurants at a similar or higher rate than before. As a result, we believe our long-term opportunity to significantly expand the UVs, margins, and store base remains in place. Thanks once again to all of our employees and partners for their dedication and hard work during these difficult times. We will get through this together and be stronger as a result of the tremendous passion and commitment from everyone. And lastly, I would be remiss if I didn't offer a heartfelt thank you to the healthcare workers for their heroic efforts on the front lines of this pandemic. With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials. Jack Hartung : Thanks and good afternoon everyone. These are unprecedented times and I could not be more proud of the way all of our people from crew and managers and our restaurants to support teams in the field and all of our support staff in Columbus and Newport Beach, have all stepped up to support each other and do everything possible to help navigate through these challenges. Unlike typical earnings calls, I will not go through our financials line-by-line, but instead, we'll briefly share how we were performing before the effects of COVID-19, and then turn most of my focus on how we're managing the business to ensure we come out of the crisis stronger than ever. Our comps through February was 14.4%, which includes nearly 11% transaction growth, including a 2% benefit from Leap Day. Restaurant margin was nearly 22% through February, as our restaurant managers and teams were doing a great job managing the business and leveraging the strong topline to drive good margin flow through. During the month of March, our weekly comp progression was up 12% for the week ending March 8th, down 4% for the week ending the 15th, and down 34% to 35% for the weeks ending March 22nd and the 29th. Sales improved to around down 30% as we entered April and then improved again over the past week with comps adjusted for Easter in the down high teens range. The beginning of April, in-store ordering is down around 75%, while delivery is up about 150% and order ahead is up nearly 120%, highlighting the importance of our digital platform and setting us up for a bright future as digital sales tend to be sticky. Digital is currently accounting for nearly 70% of sales. Given the uncertainty surrounding the impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. economy and on our sales trends, we're withdrawing our previous fiscal 2020 comp guidance. We ended Q1 with $909 million in cash and short-term investments and no debt, which puts us in a strong financial position to navigate this crisis. As sales fell quickly from the -- from the COVID impact, we proactively began to manage cash outlays to preserve liquidity. The situation is fluid and we constantly reevaluate. We -- here are some of the initiatives we have implemented so far. While we bought back about $54 million of stock during the quarter, we suspended our buyback program on March 20th, just a few days after our dining rooms were closed and we have no plans to restart the buybacks in the near-term. In the restaurants, our operators have done a tremendous job adopting to lower sales as they are efficiently managing food ordering, prepping and cooking to minimize waste while ensuring each guest receives a freshly prepared meal. They're effectively scheduling labor hours to accommodate the needs of our crew and shifting hours to support our growing digital business and they're reducing non-essential controllable costs. As a result, our return or breakeven at a comp of right around down 30% to down 35%, and that excludes recent employee investments, such as the 10% assistance paid for crew and discretionary bonuses for our managers and also excludes the free delivery that we're operating in our app, and these investments have cost us about $20 million for the month. Outside the restaurants, our supply chain team has been constantly and diligently working with our supply partners to ensure there are no major disruptions. They've done a tremendous job making sure that our restaurants have all the essentials, such as soap, cleaning supplies, gloves and hand sanitizers as well as ensuring our restaurants are stocked with our delicious ingredients. Pleased to say that we've been able to avoid wide outage while minimizing food waste. We're also in contact with our landlords, about rent deferrals and rent abatements. We are a strong tenant with significant growth ahead of us and we expect our landlords will partner with us during this difficult time period. On the G&A front, we, of course, halted all non-essential travel, and we're reconsidering the hiring of project consultants, and we're negotiating longer payment terms on the larger contracts. These will help balance preserving cash in the near-term with investing for the long term. Cash G&A is running around $20 million to $25 million per month. And if the recovery takes longer than expected, we have the ability to make additional adjustments as needed. With regard to CapEx, we're delaying non-essential reinvestments, including deferring all remodels that don't involve a digital make line or the addition of Chipotlane. But we are pulling forward those remodels that involve adding a second make line for the few restaurants that don't already have one, digitizing the second make line in those restaurants that required a remodel to fit the digital make line, and a few remodels where we're able to add a Chipotlane. Combined with new store construction, which I'll talk more about in a few minutes and our tech investments, our CapEx is running around $30 million to $35 million per month. That being said, we have the flexibility to defer or eliminate much of this CapEx, if needed. But we believe making these investments today will pay off in the long run. So to recap, our monthly ongoing cash burn is around $50 million to $60 million, assuming we break even at the restaurant level and our G&A and our CapEx is in the range I just described. Encouragingly, if comps can be sustained at the level seen over the past week of down high teens, restaurant cash flow would be in the plus $20 million range so our net cash burn would be cut by about one-third. While we don't plan to utilize the PPP loan provision of the recently passed CARES Act, we expect to see a liquidity benefit of around $100 million, primarily from deferring social security tax payments and accelerating tax depreciation and previous returns. And how we generated taxable income in Q1, we don't expect to have any related tax liability due to the tax deductions related to option exercises and equity vesting in the quarter. Finally, although we don't currently need access to the debt markets, we're working on a $250 million to $500 million revolving credit facility with our banking partners to provide us additional access to funding, should it be needed. Even before adding this facility, our balance sheet, along with the carriers, tax deferrals, can sustain us for well over a year. And that assumes our comps are at the down 30% to 35% level where our restaurants breakeven. Last week trend gives us optimism that our comps will continue to improve in the coming months. Our new unit development pipeline is continuing to build as we remain confident about the long-term opportunity to more than double the Chipotle restaurants in the U.S., and we're already beginning to see an increase in sites available as other businesses have pulled back. This will allow us to opportunistically expand the quantity of sites, while also enhancing the quality of our robust pipeline. During the quarter, we opened 19 new restaurants with 11 having a Chipotlane. And Chipotlanes continue to have a higher overall digital mix than in recent weeks is approaching 80%. In addition, the mix of higher-margin order ahead and pickup transactions has more than doubled for these restaurants as compared to the pre-COVID time frame. Our Chipotlanes and opening sales are outpacing non-Chipotlane openings by about 5% to 10% before COVID, they now are higher by over 30%. Our optimism for Chipotlanes is further enhanced by our most recent opening a few weeks ago in Eureka, California. Day one sales of nearly $15,000 was one of the highest opening days of all time. As a result of the continued strong performance of Chipotlanes and less competition for new sites, we will seek even greater proportion of Chipotlanes in our pipeline, which will enhance customer access and convenience, and increase new restaurant sales, margins and returns. Year-to-date, we have open 28 restaurants with another 49 under construction. However, we have begun to see a construction delays and therefore, have preemptively delayed groundbreaking on the majority of projects in April. So we have a better visibility into when construction will pick-up momentum again, we believe it's prudent to withdraw our prior 2020 new restaurant opening guidance. Lastly, you may have seen, we signed a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve the DOJ investigation that was previously reported relating to food safety incidents beginning in 2015. The agreement will be impact for three years \u2013 in effect for three years, the DOJ agreed to not take further action so long as we comply with the agreement, and pay a $25 million fine, with $10 million being paid on June 1st, and pre-payments of $5 million every 30 days after that first payment. These payments will unfortunately hurt our liquidity a bit, but we're ready to put this old matter behind us. In closing, despite uncertainty about the near-term impact of COVID-19, our talented and committed teams, the strength of our brand and the resiliency of our economic model gives us the confidence and conviction to make the right long-term investments for our people, for our customers, for our company and for our shareholders. And amid these unprecedented conditions, we will remain focused on not simply managing through the crisis by taking actions that will allow us to emerge even stronger. I also want to thank all of our extraordinary team members for their commitment during these challenging times. Their efforts are very much appreciated. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today will come from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. Good evening. Jack, a question for you, you were talking about some cash burn rates, $50 million, but actually might be a-third less than that on a monthly basis at the current comp decline rate. And I think you said something like $30 million to $35 million of CapEx is included in that. So, I guess, does that mean, just roughly speaking, that you're breaking even or a little bit better than that at this sort \u2013 from just a pure EBITDA standpoint at the current decline rate that you've seen lately? And I have a quick follow-up. Jack Hartung : Yeah, that's right, David. So if you look at the sales for the last week, and listen, we'd love for that to be the trend for us to improve from there. But if we just hold it at the trend we're seeing from the last week, which is down in the high-teens we earned cash flow at the restaurant level about $20 million. Our G&A is in the $20 million to $25 million range. So you're absolutely right. Before CapEx, we're right about at EBITDA breakeven. David Palmer : And just to quick question on your \u2013 on the coastal areas, those urban centers. You can imagine certain parts of the country are particularly hard hit right now. Are you seeing a pretty widespread in the type of comp decline that you're seeing? Or is that mitigated by something more of a disruption among the competitive set in those areas than whatever you're doing digitally? Thanks. John Hartung : David, it is a wide range of comp out there. As you can imagine, the Northeast, has been hit the hardest; parts of the middle of the country are much further ahead in terms of the recovery, and so it gives us great optimism that we can see our way out of it and get towards and then eventually into positive territory from a comp standpoint. David Palmer : Thank you. Jack Hartung : Thanks, David. Operator : And the next question will come from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Sara Senatore : Thanks. I have a follow-up on a separate question. So, the follow-up is just on the question of, sort of, disparities in your comp trends. Our sense is that things like day part mix or off-premise versus on and also things like urban versus suburban, are determining a lot of what's happening in terms of the recovery. Can you remind me, sort of, what your sales mix might have looked like before this, whether it's lunch or dinner? Or what percentage of your stores are in urban markets versus suburban? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of this is just a function of what the business looks like beforehand versus anything unique to the brand? And then one other question, please. Brian Niccol : So I'll start, Jack, and then you can chime in. So, obviously, Chipotle had a pretty good split between lunch and dinner, pre this crisis. We're definitely seeing a little bit of an uptick in our dinner business, or dinner occasion with a little downtick in the lunch occasion. And I think that's driven by just the natural consumer behavior of people not going out and about. The positive is the digital experience, I think, has introduced people to a new behavior and a new occasion for Chipotle, which is solving that occasion for a family meal or dinner that historically maybe they already had Chipoltle for lunch and they haven't considered us for that. So we're seeing a slight pivot just in more dinner occasion and with a little decline in the lunch occasion. And a lot of that, I think, is driven by just the situation of people being sheltered at home. And then also the ease at which the digital occasion, both contactless pickup as well as the contactless delivery. And I think one of the things that's also driving all this, order ahead, growth because people are just realizing how easy and contactless, the order ahead experience is, which is showing up in the Chipotle execution as well as using our mobile pickup channels. And then on your question about suburban versus urban. And one of the strengths of Chipotle is our suburban footprint. Frankly, really, the whole concept started from a suburban standpoint. And that continues to be a strength. And frankly, one of the things that's worked out really well is as we brought on partners, whether it's DoorDash or Uber Eats, we've really spent a lot of time making sure they had coverage in the suburban markets. And then, obviously, we have a presence in urban markets as well. And not surprising, as Jack mentioned, the Northeast or the New York is more -- is a laggard as a region, relative to what we're seeing in our other regions on the recovery. But we're seeing a lot of positive things happening in our digital business. It will be very interesting to see, as we are given the opportunity to start to open our dining rooms here in the next, call it, weeks or a month, how we're able to continue to keep people engaged in our delivery business, our digital business. Because the one thing that, hopefully, you picked up in here is our rewards database just went from eight million to almost 12 million. And that's going to be a very valuable asset, I think, going forward as we work through the recovery. Jack, I don't know if there's anything to add? John Hartung : No, I think you covered it really well, Brian. Thanks. Brian Niccol : Okay. Sara Senatore : Thanks. Very helpful. Just both of you were in the industry back during the global financial crisis. If you think back then, would you anticipate as we come out of this -- there's a silver lining, possibly better opportunities on real estate or maybe some of the capacity come out? I was just curious what your institutional memory might tell you about what we look at like on the other side? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, great question. I think this is really the strength of our brands, our balance sheet and our digital business is going to, I think, set us up very nicely on the opportunities that present themselves as we get to the other side of this. The obvious opportunities, I think, are some things we've already talked about. We're not shying away from sites and our ability to get the sites that we believe are best for our future digital business and our Chipotlanes. And then I also think just very much being on trend with people having access to real wholesome nutritious food is going to continue to be at the forefront of good health. And I think good health and well-being is going to be an even more important trend in the consumer psyche going forward. And I think we're very well positioned in the fast casual category and the brand in the fast casual category to get people access to that higher quality food with integrity in the access and the experience that they want, which is the least amount of friction with arguably the least amount of contact. And we're well positioned for all those things. And then the strength of our balance sheet and the strength, frankly of how we're able to flow every incremental dollar allows us to invest in future real estate, future sites, future digital, and we're optimistic once we get to the other side of this. Sara Senatore : Thank you. Operator : And our next question will be from Katherine Fogertey with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Katherine Fogertey : Great. Thank you. I wanted to touch base on menu innovation. It's not something that was really brought up too much on the call today, but how you're thinking about the forward here? And in particular, as we're looking at the consumer here, the financial impact that virus has had on the consumer, where are the opportunities you think to grow check or potentially even take share just given your price point relative to the competition? Thank you. Brian Niccol : Sure. So look, we are still big believers in our menu program. I think we've talked about this. We saw opportunity in beverage we still believe there is an opportunity in beverage for us to have. Beverages with same type of commitment to organic, no artificial ingredients, less sugar, the juices. So you're going to see us continue to push into beverages. And then the case of Blanco launch, I got to tell you was -- it was coming out of the gates as evidenced by where our comps were, right, in January and February, it was getting huge positive feedback. Our teams were loving it, the customers were loving it, and I think there's an opportunity still to reengage people in case of Blanco once we get past this. And then we're still working hard at bringing back carne asada. And then there's a few other things that are going through our stage gate process, which we've had to delay just because this is not the environment where you can go test and the restaurants to really understand consumer experience, operational experience. But we have some early reads on this, and we feel really good about being on trend with different meats, different grains, I think what we've always talked about it is we want to meet customers' requests. So we're testing the quesadilla, but we also want to leave consumers to higher quality food or different food experiences, and that's why you see us talking about things like briskets and color flour rice and so on and so forth. So, consumer sentiment hasn't changed on the desire for those things. We just have to make sure we do it at the right time because we want to come back operationally strong with the core business before we start adding some of those things. Katherine Fogertey : That's helpful. And then just one follow-up here on commodity. We've seen a lot of deflation across the entire universe. Is there any opportunity for you guys to lean in and lock in some contracts? What's the environment like here? And how can you kind of kind of leverage this current backdrop? Thank you. Jack Hartung : Yes. Katy, on the commodities, it's likely to be a favorable commodity scenario going forward. We deal with a lot of small farmers. And so generally, we don't have a great opportunity to lock in like you would if you were buying the commodity meats, for example. Although we definitely think that there's going to be a time for us to be able to support our farmers in a way where we can bring not only strong demand, but hopefully growing demand as well. And we think that will lead to favorable pricing. But in terms of locking in, that's not likely. The only wildcard, as usual for us, is avocados. And we'll see this should be a favorable or pretty favorable year for us, but we'll see how demand and supply match up. And hopefully, this will be a more normal year since we've had two or three or four years now in a row of pretty volatile avocado cost. Katherine Fogertey : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will be from David Tarantino of Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi, good afternoon. I hope everyone is doing well. My first question is on just the commentary around real estate and recognizing that you do have the enviable position of a good balance sheet that you might be able to take advantage of some opportunities. Just wondering if you could maybe comment further on how you're envisioning the rate of growth exiting the crisis that we're seeing now. Do you think there's opportunity to accelerate the pace of unit growth maybe in 2021, 2022, however you want to answer that? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, David, I think there's going to be an opportunity for us for two reasons because I think we've made tremendous progress on the people front. So, our turnover has really come down over the last, call it, year. So, we have more stability with our leaders. And then I also think, in the environment, we're going to have the ability to recruit and retain even more people going forward, which will really set us up nicely for an acceleration in development. And I think we've always talked about it. We just want to take a very measured approach to how we accelerate that growth because we want to open the restaurants with great teams, great experiences and great financials. And -- but this will definitely present an opportunity where I think our pipeline will get bigger. And we'll present the opportunity for us to staff them and run them really well so that we can continue to accelerate our growth plan. David Tarantino : Got it. And then the second question I have is related to operations. And I guess how do you envision the operations working in your format in the world of social distancing on the other side of this as you open up your dining room I guess, what steps are you taking? And do you think you'll see throughput constraints come back as you try to maintain social distancing on the line as an example? Brian Niccol : Yes. So, obviously, this is something we've been spending a lot of time on. And frankly, this morning, we spent a lot of time on it. We're going to make sure that we provide all the indicators in the restaurant so that the customer has the confidence what they're supposed to do to maintain the social distance, as well as our team members. But look, you're going to see our team members wearing masks, you're going to see our team members wearing gloves, you're going to see a team member in the dining room that's sanitizing tables and high-traffic areas. The hand sanitizer will be in the dining room. We probably will have to move things off of the drink station and make sure that we have a little bit more control of that, so that those things are clean and sanitized the way that we would want them to be, so that every person that gets a drink or grabs a Tabasco bottle can have confidence. But look, think the one thing that is great about our business is our customers that come in the restaurant they know how to order a Chipotle. And they're part of the process to move down that line quickly, as much as our employees are part of the process to move down that line quickly. And I \u2013 I think the combination of our digital business getting up to the 60%, 70% of sales. I think we're going to hang on to as much of that as we possibly can, while we build back our dine-in business. And I think over time, some of these restrictions or behaviors will migrate back to the way it used to be. But the good news is our model is very durable in this environment for when we actually are able to open the dining room. But we're going to be very specific on the actions we've taken in the restaurant to give people the confidence that they're having a healthy experience. But in the near term, it's going to be something that we're going to have to learn our way through. And I'm confident Scott and his leaders will do a great job of managing the dining room reopening. David Tarantino : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Andrew Charles of Cowen. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles : Great. Thanks. In a normalized environment, marketing and promotional expense typically runs about 3% of sales. And given the headwinds the sales that we're seeing throughout the industry, philosophical, are you looking to pare back spending in aim to run 3% marketing expense off the lower base of 2020 sales? Or are you looking to maintain kind of a similar $180 million to $190 million budget that you had at the beginning of the year? I'm thinking about in the context that, obviously, the shift from live sports to streaming platforms is less expensive advertising, but I would imagine this probably gets offset by subsidizing delivery fees for the foreseeable future. Brian Niccol : Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you kind of hit the nail on the head. What I think Chris and the team are really focusing on is every dollar we spend in the marketing is how do we maximize the return for the environment we're in. And I think the team has done a phenomenal job of it, pivoting away from traditional television, frankly, and moving more towards delivery incentives around delivery, and then also using platforms social, digital. I love how the guys quickly pivoted to like Chipotle together, right? These are things that we were the first ones doing, because I think Chris and the team are very much in tune with where the consumer is. And where young people want to experience their brands and how they want to experience the brand. So we're going to spend to do those things. And whether the absolute dollars end up being a little different, probably. But really, what we're focused on is getting the return so that we feel good about the dollars that we're investing, and we see that showing up, obviously, in both the top line and then the bottom line. So very proud of where we are and how we pivoted our spending. And I think, we'll continue to see us lead in this space. Andrew Charles : That's great. And then just my follow-up question is that, you guys disclosed a high 60%, almost 70% digital mix of sales so far in April. How does that mix of sales differ between carryout and delivery relative to what the \u2013 relative to the digital carryout and delivery mix before COVID-19? Is it safe to say that you're seeing delivery sales now represent the majority of the digital sales for the most recent week? Brian Niccol : No. What I would tell you is, delivery definitely those first couple weeks in March really took off. But over the last couple of weeks, we have seen order ahead, frankly, catch up and \u2013 as our digital business has just grown in totality. And so the mix prior to COVID, we're seeing a slight change in \u2013 I would say the biggest change is our catering business went away. And as a result, what we've seen is really kind of delivery be a little bit more of the leader with order ahead not far behind, but both are hugely, hugely up. Andrew Charles : That\u2019s great. Thanks guys. Operator : The next question will be from Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Nicole Miller : Thank you. Good afternoon. I appreciate the update. I wanted to dig into the April, let's say, less worse environment, quite a big jump. There is probably now a half dozen restaurant companies that have the statement. What do you think is happening on the consumer behavior side? Because it seems like right now and going forward, it's all going to be about what the behavior is now and then the tipping point to see it changes. So I'd be curious on really just what the heck to think is going on? Is it so start crazy or advertising is kicking in? What do you think might be causing that? Brian Niccol : Well, look, I think there's a couple of things; one, I think all the pantry loading behavior has slowed down. And I think also people have worked through their pantries. And I think also people realized they bought a lot of things that they end up having to throw away. And I think there's fatigue in cooking. So combine that with the fact that also tax refunds and stimulus money is starting getting into the hands of people. And I think people were like, you know what, I've got the additional cash, I've worked through my pantry loading and I think it's time to break the routine of me cooking and being a little stir crazy and let's reach out for restaurants to solve the solution. So I think that's just the fundamental to set up right now, which is most stimulus money in the hands of customers. And then the pantry loading behavior, I think, has really slowed down dramatically and they've worked through all the goods that they purchased in their pantries. Nicole Miller : That's helpful. And so just a follow-up and last question on that point, to what degree can this serve as a proxy for the recovery? So if I think about Chipotle in '15 and in '16, what happened then as you perfectly positioned as you've been outlining for the last hour basically, to take this head on? So I think back to that time, I would say that probably impaired the brand to some degree, was dilutive to the brand equity to some degree, specific to your brand, obviously. But that's not the case, everyone's being treated equally. So is this more like a remodel pattern? I guess, the real question is, everybody is, I guess, in the same boat, you close, reopen. And the question is how long to get back to the prior run rate? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, here's what I would tell you is, I'm very excited about the opportunity to get our dining arms reopen. I'm very excited about leveraging all the digital gains we've made. And then I'm also very optimistic about our ability to operate once the dining room is open. We have our digital business running next to us in an environment where we're working with elevated wellness practices, elevated food safety practices, because these are all things that we've been doing for years now that a lot of people are just starting to adopt. So I think we're always going to be the ones that will look to figure out what we can do next on wellness and food safety. But I'm very confident about our operators being able to operate in that environment. And then I'm very optimistic about what will happen as the phased, kind of, reopening of the economies goes into effect because I think we're going to hang on to a lot of our gains, digitally. And a lot of the gains we've made culturally and operationally as we reopen these dining rooms. But look, that timetable, I think, is going to be driven very much about when the economy gets reopened so that people can start experiencing dining rooms and the full access of restaurants. So -- but it looks like that's going to start loosening up here over the next month or two. Nicole Miller : Thank you. Operator : And the next question will be from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John Glass : Thanks very much. First, Jack, if I can just follow-up on the restaurant margin question you answered earlier about the cash consumption or the cash breakeven. What does that translate back into? If comps are down high teens, what is the percent restaurant margin that that translates into? And is unusual about that number I noticed you talked about? Is it fully loaded with the rent, for example? I think there was some increase in wages. On the other hand, maybe you don't -- I don't know if you're fully staffed restaurants. What's unusual in the current restaurant margin? John Hartung : Yeah. John, I don't even have handy, what percentage of sales that would be. It's still a very low margin. If we're still down in the down teens, it's still bumpy line item by line item. Our teams have done a great job of managing the business for the lower volume, but we're not going to cut our staffing too short so that when the surge happens. The more people come in and the orders start to rise, we want to be ready for that. I think the point there is just that we can get breakeven at the 30, 35. We're hoping this is a new trend. And so it reduces our cash burn by a lot. What I would tell you we're thinking about is when we think about what happens when the dining rooms reopen and we start to build back our dining room business. And as Brian mentioned, keep as much of our digital, we feel like we'll be able to get back to the margins we are running before as we get back to that run rate. We were at a better than $2.2 million, our AUV on our way to $2.3 million. And we're already showing through February, which January and February are not great margin months, and we're already at 22%. So we know when we get back to those volumes, the $2.2 million, and then on our way back to $2.3 million. That's the kind of margins you could expect us to deliver. But we're still down in the high teens. It's still going to be a single-digit kind of margin, John, but it's something that reduces the cash burn and allows us to make the right investments for the long-term. John Glass : That's very helpful. And just a follow-up, you mentioned in the release, the Cares Act tax benefits were about $100 million. Is that all inside of 2019 and is that all expressed through the tax rate? Was there some of that in this quarter? And how do we think about how those benefits flow over the next quarters or year? John Hartung : It's all this year, John, but it's all cash basis. So none of it is earnings basis. So, for example, it's a deferral of things like self security taxes. We're going to have to pay those beginning next year, but it saves us cash this year and we need it the most. And then there's depreciation resets that we get for 2018 and 2019. And so from a book basis, there's no change at all because the book depreciation doesn't change, but our tax depreciation does. So it will affect our cash flow. It will affect our deferred taxes, will not affect our earnings margins or EPS. John Glass : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will be from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead. Brian Bittner : Thanks. Appreciate the question. With digital trends now at 70% of sales, I assume they're not going to remain that high when we're through this virus, but they're probably going to remain pretty sticky, which means your delivery business is probably going to remain a much bigger part of your business moving forward. Is there a tipping point where you potentially think about mixing in some of your own delivery drivers? Or can you just talk a little bit more about the strategy for delivery if it becomes that large of a business? Thanks. Brian Niccol : Yes. So, obviously, we're optimistic that we'll hang on to both our order ahead business as well as the delivery business. And -- but specifically to your question on delivery, I think the reality is it works off our digital make line, which sets us up for a very different walk on how we get to the margins we get through our delivery business. And what we have said is, look, as partners potentially change commission rates or you see various economic impacts on it. There's just a general understanding with the folks we work with, where it's like, look, we need to make money at it, you need to make money at it, and we'll figure out how we make this work. And fortunately, for us, our food works very well in the delivery occasion, our customer has had positive feedback on the experience and the partners that we have are very willing to have the right dialogue and be transparent with each other so that we can make the channel work for each other. So we're going to take a very smart approach to it, where it should be still viewed as a positive to have this occasion for the Chipotle business. And that's the approach we're going to take, and we'll continue to be transparent with our partners as we work through this. Brian Bittner : Thanks. Appreciate all the color, Brian. Brian Niccol : Sure. Operator : The next question is from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : Hi. Good afternoon. Hoping you could touch on the restaurant level labor situation and how difficult recruitment might be in this environment or a turnover has been trending? And then separately, Jack, it sounds like you've kind of implied this, but are there any structural cost changes to the model coming out of this? Brian Niccol : Well, I'll take the labor thing, and then I can hand it over to you, Jack, on the structural question. John Hartung : Okay. Brian Niccol : But on the labor side of things, I think this is really where we're seeing the power of our purpose and our culture, because we're seeing turnover actually improve. We're seeing fewer people walking away from Chipotle. We're also seeing people that are with us, very proud to be with us. And I think we've been very purposeful in executing against what we believe are our values and the right thing to do. And as a result, our restaurant managers, our restauranteurs, these folks have more tenure with us than we ever have. And they're excited about the opportunity of the new restaurants we're going to open, and they're excited about how Chipotle is going to get to the other side of this. So, I think we will -- based on the communication we've had with our employees. They've been very, very, very supportive of the Chipotle business, the Chipotle culture, and each other. And I think we're very fortunate that way. And I think going forward, we're going to be a place that people are going to want to work and so and we're going to be a place where people are going to be able to grow. And I think that's going to attract the right talent so that we can grow our business effectively. On the structural stuff, I'll pass it over to Jack, but we don't see that doesn't seem to be a headwind. But over to you, Jack. Jack Hartung : Yes, I don't think so, Sharon. There's going to be stuff in the short-term, like when the dining rooms reopen, and we're actively talking about what exactly that means, and we're going to have to follow everything that's happening in the state and the local jurisdictions and the like. But it's likely for some period of time, we'll have an extra person in the dining room just to make sure the customers see that we're constantly cleaning that if they have questions about social distancing or what have you, there's somebody there. So, there's likely to be some extra cost for a while. On the other hand, with a higher digital we know that our digital business is more efficient, it takes less labor on that digital make line to serve as many customers. And so we're, in fact, seeing efficiencies in that. We're seeing that we're using less labor to deliver some of the sales that we have to add hours for in the past. So, I think there's pushes and pulls. I think when we get fully to the end of this, past the transition and let's say, a year from now or something like that; I don't think there's going to be any meaningful structural cost. I think our model will be fully intact. But it will be a little bit bumpy when we get -- as we get from here to there. Operator : And our next question will come from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you. A couple of clarifications, if I may. First, were the 100 restaurants that were closed, temporarily closed, included or excluded in the same-store sales commentary? Brian Niccol : They're-- John Ivankoe : They're included? Brian Niccol : Included. John Ivankoe : Okay, perfect. And then secondly, 30% of your sales being non-digital, were 100% of your restaurants, I mean, I guess, could they serve non-digital transactions? Were there any examples in any markets where the stores had to be 100% digital, I guess, by market mandate or what have you? Or were you able to keep all the restaurants open for that not non-digital so far? Brian Niccol : Yes, we had a couple of hundred where we were purely digital. I think it's like 200 or 300 range. But otherwise, the balance of the system, we're still able to do come in and carry out. John Ivankoe : And did you learn anything from any of those fully digital restaurants? I mean, is that -- I mean do you think you could have done more of those restaurants and still even taking up the digital mix even higher? I mean what type of experience or learnings that you get from digital-only restaurants, which, obviously, were also cashless as well. Brian Niccol : Yes. So, look, 1 of the things that's definitely true is the in-restaurant experience still provides another level of customization, which people still appreciate for a certain occasion. We still have great customization in our digital app and on the website. But look, if you want to build that little extra mile of customization, that's something you get from an in-store experience. So, that would probably be the biggest thing that we've noticed is some of our heaviest users or loyal users really appreciate having access to the dining room. But the good news is they're getting experience with our app now. And they're realizing \u2013 and you'll see us do this going forward. We're going to, I think, educate people more on how they can customize via the app and the web, because there's a lot of very simple practices on \u2013 if you want to put your sauce on the side, it's easy. If you want to do half and half, easy. And people still are getting used to how they do their customization. But I would say the biggest learning is our people that are very loyal to the idea of coming into the restaurant and getting their Chipotle their way, and that makes us unique. So that\u2019s it. John Ivankoe : Definitely, yes. it's an obvious difference. And the final kind of question. In terms of reopening the dining room, I mean, what type of \u2013 what will you look for in the marketplace? I mean, obviously, some governors, Georgia being one or kind of vary ahead of the curve in terms of kind of getting people back out, others for different and obvious reasons, kind of on the other spectrum, but in a lot of local markets, mayors themselves are making decisions. So I mean, is there \u2013 do you want to open entire states at a time, markets at a time? And when you kind of think about reopening your dining rooms, even with a lot of social distancing are probably in place. And what are you looking for the permission to go out and start to reopen that full experience? Brian Niccol : Yes. So look, I think this is going to be a by restaurant approach for us. And this is one of the things that I think is terrific about us being all company owned. We have the flexibility and the capability to do it. So we've got a very \u2013 we're very fortunate, too. We've got a leader of food safety and wellness, Kerry Bridge is her name. She's very tied in right now with the CDC and the FDA. And she's tracking for us and having those conversations so that as the government and the science and the data comes in, we can be best informed so that we can provide a healthy experience, both for our customer and our crews. And we're going to execute this restaurant-by-restaurant because I think what we're seeing is this virus is very much proving to be very different depending on where you are in the country. And fortunately, we're set up where we have the capability to open that way, our dining rooms. And I think we have the people capability to execute it in the restaurant, and we have the people capability to get the right information. So we make smart decisions as we reopen. John Ivankoe : Thank you so much. Brian Niccol : Yes. Operator : The next question will be from Jon Tower with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jon Tower : Awesome. Thanks. I hope everybody is okay. Just a few on the Chipotlanes. And frankly, just thinking about this business going forward. In terms of \u2013 you mentioned earlier, the idea that real estate is opening up, and you're getting access to potentially better sites. Are you also thinking that you may have potentially better rents going forward? And then on top of that, historically, you've shied away from the idea of owning any real estate, but clearly, you've got a fairly strong cash balance. Does that cash balance and potentially, real estate prices dropping, make it more attractive to move towards that ownership structure? And then I got another one after that, please? Jack Hartung : Yes. Listen, good question. It's likely that rents are going to relax a little bit. Now we typically go after A sites and A trade areas. Those tend to hold their value, their rent values more than if you're going to go to a B or C location. But I would still think when there's less competition out there that we're going to see relaxed rents. The thing that I think we're most excited about is, where landlords might have been resistant to add a Chipotlane in the past like picture and cap and then a landlord having to redo the whole circulation around that property because we've asked for a Chipotlanes. While they might have resisted that a bit in the past, we're not seeing much resistance of that anymore. The fact that we're looking to go into a site, we're continuing to grow that's what we're most excited about. But we do think we'll be able to get more sites, higher quality sites, more Chipotlanes, and I would expect that the rents would be \u2013 should be at least incrementally more attractive. We've never really been against buying. If there's an opportunity to buy a site, we typically are going after going into somebody else's building. So we don't do a lot of free standards. We do, do free standards, they're often on the pad of a shopping center. And typically, the landlord or developer, they like to keep those. But I have to tell you, if a developer is cash poor and they're looking to sell a site and if the price is right, we'll certainly be there and we're willing to definitely buy that land. So we can lock in our occupancy costs forever. Jon Tower : Great. And then just on the Chipotlane following that line of thinking, you had mentioned, I think, previous calls, greater than 55% of the development was going to be tied to Chipotlane and for 2020, at least, in thinking about the where that can move for the balance of this year and next year? Are we talking about this being a higher run rate going forward in terms -- as a percentage of the mix? And are we talking somewhere between 80% to 90% of new stores being in that Chipotlane format? John Hartung : Definitely going to be higher, 80% to 90% might be a little high because we still do open up in some storefronts and some urban areas as well. But it's definitely going to be higher than the 50% to 60%. In fact, we're even seeing that deals that we've already done or have mostly done. We go back and say, hey, by the way, we talked about that Chipotlane and you weren't that crazy about it, what do you think about it now? And we're getting landlords to say, you know what, if you're still willing to go to the site, we'll do it, right. I do think for this year, you'll see the percentage of Chipotlanes inch up. And then I think for next year, I think you'll see a stair-step, I don't know that 80% or 90% is realistic, but certainly higher than 60% and maybe north of 70% as well. But we'll see. So far, the reaction from the landlords has been good. So we're very, very optimistic. Jon Tower : Great. Thank you. Stay healthy everybody. John Hartung : Thank you. Operator : And the next question will be from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. First, Jeff, just a clarification on the restaurant margin conversation we talked about earlier. It's obviously hard to read the most recent trends, but still think it's fair to assume that $100,000, equating to 200 basis points of margin? Or is it in the short to medium-term that there are going to be some structural headwinds that would make that a little bit harder to achieve, even if you do think that \u2013 I think you said ultimately, you do think that those two numbers would once again go lock step together? John Hartung : Yes. I think long term, we're 100% on that same page that when we get back to, call it, $2.2 million, we could be at 22. And then every $100,000 of volume, you can get an extra 100 basis points of margin. I just think between now and then, it's going to be bumpy. It's going to be bumpy because there's going to be dislocations throughout the country and how the recovery happens, it's not always perfect when you add volume or pause on volume that you get the right response in terms of the labor management, the management of food and waste and things like that. And listen, we're not going to go crazy over that as we navigate through this recovery. But I think once you get through the recovery, I think our earnings power, our margin power is going to be fully intact. Jeffrey Bernstein : Got it. And with that said, as we \u2013 I know you withdrew your 2020 guidance, which seems prudent. But as we think about 2020 and 2021 modeling, I know it's difficult at this point. But from a sensitivity standpoint, how do you think about each point of comp or each 100 basis point of margin in terms of a framework to think about earnings over the next year or so? John Hartung : Yeah. I'd tell you, I just wouldn't -- I wouldn't want to lock into what the next few quarters are going to be. If you want to look a year ahead and let's look at when there's either a virus or anti-virals, and the economy is back and humming again. I think we're fully back to the 100,000, equals 100 basis points. I think in the interim, I think it's just too hard. And listen, it's going to be bumpy. I mean, EPS is not going to be that predictable. And so what is going to be predictable is the investments we're going to make. We're going to make them in our people. We're going to be able to make investments in our future. In terms of real estate, we're going to make sure that from an employment brand, from a customer brand and from the investments we're making for the future, that we're going to do all the right things. In terms of EPS in the short-term for the next few quarters, just be ready for that to be bumpy. But I think the investments we're going to make and the impact that we're having, positive impact we're having on our brand, I think, creates a bright future for us beyond that. Jeffrey Bernstein : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Brian Niccol : Yeah. Thank you. And thank you, everybody, for taking the time to discuss our current situation in the Chipotle business. I want to just first reiterate what I said at the beginning. A huge thank you and gratefulness to all our employees and supplier partners that are keeping the Chipotle experience up and running in our communities. Couldn't be prouder of the way we have handled this in the way that our culture has really shown itself. So very proud of everyone and frankly, very humbled by seeing all of it. The other thing I will leave you all with is, and we've kind of talked about this throughout the whole Q&A. We're very fortunate that the Chipotle brand is as strong as it is, compounded by a very strong balance sheet with, I think, very smart investments that we made on the digital side, as well as on our operations and food safety culture. And I think that just sets us up to navigate the current situation at hand. And I look forward to getting back to achieving the results we had frankly in January and February, once we get past this crisis. And I'm confident that, as Jack mentioned, we're going to be very prudent on managing our cash, but we're also going to be very smart about investing in the Chipotle proposition for the future. So thank you again everybody. Hopefully, everyone in families and friends are healthy and safe out there, and I look forward to talking to all of you in the future. Best. Take care. Operator : Thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ashish Kohli : Hello, everyone and welcome to our second quarter 2020 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it maybe found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management\u2019s current business and market expectations and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today\u2019s call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Brian. Brian Niccol : Thanks, Ashish and good afternoon, everyone. Since our last earnings call, the world has continued to face unprecedented challenges with regard to health, economic and social issues. However, I am so proud of our employees those in the field managing and running our restaurants, our support center staff who are working remotely, as well as our supply partners for coming together to continue to provide our safe, delicious, high-quality food made from real ingredients. As a result, Chipotle is successfully delivering on its commitment to help cultivate a better world for our employees, guests, farmers, communities and shareholders. Today, I want to focus my discussion on three key topics. First, our efforts to take care of our people and guests as restaurants reopen for in-room dining; second, provide details on our improving comp trends; and third, highlight how we have built an operating model that\u2019s designed to generate strong performance in a wide variety of environments such that we can win today while we create a bright future. As I have mentioned previously, the health and well-being of our employees and guests has always been and will continue to be our top priority. Given our strong financial position, we are able to make investments in our people and the Chipotle business, which are not only helping us manage through this crisis, but set us up for a strong recovery and future success. Our top priorities for the rest of the year include safely running our restaurants and reopening dining rooms, using best practices to support alternative restaurant support center working arrangements, ensuring supply chain consistency and strengthening our digital ecosystem. Within our restaurants, we have taken a number of steps to enhance our robust food safety and wellness protocols, including the creation of the steward role, which is focused on sanitization in high-touch and high traffic areas, providing mats for all employees and having a tamper evident packaging seal for all digital orders. We are also delighted to see many of our guests doing their part by wearing masks, socially distancing and where appropriate, leaving instructions in our app and online to request contactless deliveries and carryout. These initiatives give our employees and guests confidence that Chipotle remains steadfast in our commitment to keeping them safe, especially now that the dining rooms are starting to reopen. As of last week, about 30 restaurants remain fully closed and these are mainly inside malls and shopping centers. We began to open dining capabilities in the middle of May and currently have about 85% of our restaurants offering limited in-restaurant and/or patio dining, with the remaining being open for to-go services, which includes delivery, order-ahead and pickup and coming into the restaurant and ordering a meal that is taken then off-premise. Encouragingly, since sales dropped in late March, we have been able to retain 70% to 80% of our digital sales gains, while recovering 40% to 50% of our in-store sales. This supports our thesis that digital tends to be highly sticky and was a key factor in helping improve our sales performance as the quarter progressed. Our Q2 comp was down 9.8%, which includes a 1.9% headwind from closed restaurants. Our restaurant level margins were 12.2% and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.40, down 90% year-over-year. In terms of monthly comp cadence, April was down 24%, with May being down 7% and then June showing further progress to finish up 2%. July comps continue to improve and are up 6.4% month-to-date, including about a 1.4% positive impact from the July 4 weekend and about a 2.7% negative impact due to underperforming restaurants in the northeast and international markets as well as restaurants closures due to COVID-19. And keep in mind, we are comparing against the nearly 10% positive comp in July of 2019. Overall, these trends highlight that despite these unprecedented conditions, our five key strategies continue to resonate with guests and position us for success in the near-term as well as giving us more confidence in doubling our restaurant base, while ultimately expanding AUVs and margins above $2.5 million and 25% respectively. Let me spend the rest of my time providing brief update on each of these strategies, which are making the brand visible and loved, creating innovations utilizing a stage-gate process, leveraging our digital make line to expand access and convenience, engaging with customers through our loyalty program, and running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food, hospitality, throughput and economics. To begin with, our marketing team has been remarkably agile and proactive during the crisis by quickly pivoting from traditional television advertising to creative social and digital media to help keep the Chipotle brand relevant and drive awareness of our digital capabilities, whether it be healthcare heroes to support frontline workers, lifestyle goals to keep people healthy, while working from home for virtual events such as proms, concerts, e-gaming tournaments, and the virtual farmers market. These initiatives are helping support our customers, suppliers and communities in the time of need. These efforts continue to drive awareness, expand access and grow sales by driving culture, driving difference and ultimately driving a purchase. In conjunction with marketing, our stage-gate process is a key enabler to develop innovation that leads food culture and meets guest requests. Over the last 18 months, lifestyle bowls, carne asada, Supergreens salad mix and Queso Blanco were all successfully validated by this process. Despite less marketing support than initially planned, our new Queso, which uses 13 real ingredients and has just the right spice level and texture, has been a hit with guests. Our current attach rate of high-teens is roughly 70% higher than with the previous Queso. The latest innovation to make it through the stage-gate process and upgrading existing item is a suite of tractor beverages. These are organic, non-GMO, less sugary and aligned well with our food with integrity ethos. We received terrific customer feedback and expect these to help improve our drink incidents moving forward. While COVID of course has delayed testing menu items over the past few months, the pipeline of potential new options continues to build. Now, that regions are starting to reopen, we anticipate being able to test new items again, which will allow us to deliver on our goal of rolling out 1 to 2 new menu items on average per year. To give you a couple of examples, we have recently launched a pilot to test cilantro lime, cauliflower rice and began offering quesadillas as a digital-only entree, which we believe can overcome the throughput challenge presented on the frontline. These menu items are in various markets where we are gaining valuable guest and operational feedback. We will update you on our progress of all potential new menu items as they move through our stage-gate process. Next, our digital platform has been a big beneficiary of the current environment. Order to digital sales from 216% year-over-year to $829 million which is by far our highest ever quarterly level and represented 61% of sales. Working from home, driving increased digital awareness via advertising, new delivery partnerships with Uber Eats and GrubHub as well as expanding our digital capabilities into Canada are attracting new customers and helping reduce friction, while increasing convenient access. Notably, partnering with all the major third-party delivery aggregators has led to an increase in orders, a reduction in delivery time and cancellations and an improvement in overall customer ratings. As you know, all digital orders from Chipotle are fulfilled via our digital kitchens, which are comprised of a dedicated make-line and operated by a special team in nearly all Chipotle locations. Recent digital investments such as pepper, our concierge spot on Facebook Messenger, group ordering and complete customization are further optimizing a seamless ordering experience for our guests. Even with in-restaurant dining opening back up, we continue to see strong digital sales momentum in July, with a mix of nearly 50%. Breaking this down further shows that a little more than half is coming from order-ahead and pickup transactions, while the remainder is coming from delivery, both channels continue to perform well, but we are pleased that order-ahead is now our fastest grower due partly to being less promotional on delivery, partly to more customers realizing the value of a pickup transaction, as are no delivery fees, and to a lesser extent, more Chipotles. With free-delivery promotions likely to be less frequent moving forward and as pivoting more aggressively towards Chipotles, we are optimistic that the order-ahead transaction will continue to be a big driver of future growth, which should benefit both sales and margins. Another element that has seen a meaningful acceleration over the past few months is our Rewards program, which now has nearly 15 million enrolled members, what an amazing accomplishment considering this program was launched only 15 months ago. The rate of enrollment has roughly doubled during the COVID crisis as customers flocked to Chipotle\u2019s digital ordering channels. Today, the question I hear most frequently is how are we going to benefit from this? Interestingly, even in the early stages of utilizing the customer data, we are seeing a significantly higher frequency of transactions from members versus non-members. Its early days, but we are starting to leverage this growing installed base with personalized promotions to incent behaviors, especially considering more than 70% of current digital orders are from our members. We are also using this tool to help make our digital platform stickier by reengaging customers if their usage drops. As we continue to enhance our CRM journeys, we are seeing incremental transactions across all frequency bands, not only as a result of the offers, but also from our brand, safety and purpose-driven messaging. We will continue to leverage our data over the second half of this year and expect loyalty to become a bigger tailwind over time as our install base expands and we increase our level of sophistication with this large base of consumers. Driving more people to Chipotle is only part of the equation. The other key is to ensure great restaurant operations so that guests have an enjoyable experience and continue to come back. As I visit our restaurants, it\u2019s apparent that the investments we are making and our people are paying off as our food tastes great, employee retention continues to stabilize and service levels are improving. Not only is this benefiting us currently, but these factors should position us well to drive higher throughput post COVID as in restaurant demand returns to a more normal level. What has always attracted me to Chipotle and what I believe is a key point of differentiation is our unique purpose of cultivating a better world and a culture that has always been committed to fostering diverse, inclusive and safe environment where everyone can belong and have the opportunity to build personal and professional success and make a positive difference in their family and communities. This isn\u2019t always easy, especially given the unrest and uncertainty at the moment, but we must do what is right, even when it\u2019s hard. More recently, Chipotle has taken several actions to help drive out inequality and injustice, including listening sessions with our employees, financial contributions to organizations advocating against systemic racism and forming a multicultural employee resource group. The bottom line is that we are all in this together and when we do our part we can make a difference to our employees, our food, our business practices and in our communities. Before I conclude, I want to publicly welcome our two new directors, Mary Winston and Gregg Engles, both bring excellent experience to our board and will be valuable assets for Chipotle. Finally, I want to thank all of our employees for delivering excellent guest experiences and supporting our restaurants and each other. Their belief in our purpose, commitment to living our values and hard work is what\u2019s pulled us through what we hope is the worst of the COVID crisis. By channeling our energy into programs and initiatives that help us become a stronger team, innovate and grow our business, I believe we will finish 2020 with good momentum and be well-positioned for the long run. With that, here is Jack to walk you through the financials. Jack Hartung : Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. Before discussing our second quarter results, I also must recognize and thank our incredible teams. I have personally been inspired to watch everyone come together to face our current challenges embracing new ways of working and decisively taking actions to safely serve our guests in the face of unprecedented conditions. From our operators doing a tremendous job managing the restaurants and providing guests a delicious customized meal, our supply chain diligently working with our partners to ensure there are no major disruptions and our support teams and development teams working virtually to keep the business moving forward. I could not be prouder to be part of this team. Looking at our Q2 performance, while the comp was down 9.8% for the quarter, it improved sequentially every month and we are pleased to see this progress continue into July. Relative to the pre-COVID environment, in-store ordering currently is down around 37%, while order-ahead is up 140% and delivery is up 125%. We are also encouraged by the fact that there is a higher incidence of new customers, majority coming via the digital platform making their second purchase in the same month and spending more than before. It\u2019s another example of our digital access being sticky, resulting in our July today digital mix staying nearly 50% of sales. Restaurant level margin for the quarter of 12.2% was negatively impacted by significant number of investments, including promotion to acquire digital customers through bonuses and assistance pay, along with costs related to COVID as well as higher supply chain expenses, most notably, the spike in beef prices that has since eased somewhat since the peak in May. During the quarter, marketing and promo costs were elevated at 5% of sales due to free delivery. With this promotion behind us, we expect marketing spend to normalize during the second half of 2020 towards our typical target of 3%. While the investment in our people to acquire \u2013 and to acquire digital customers put pressure on our margins in the quarter, we are confident that these were the right investments to make and will make our brand and our culture much stronger over time. If you consider the month of June where our comp turned slightly positive and we are trending a little over $2.2 million AUV run-right, restaurant level margin was roughly 20%. The gap relative to the theoretical 22% margin we would expect at the sales level is primarily the impact of higher delivery mix and partially the result of the temporary costs I just mentioned, including higher beef cost. Similar to what many of our peers are already doing, we are about to experiment with delivery, menu prices as a way to potentially help offset this headwind and fully capture the margins expected at this volume. As Brian mentioned, we believe our powerful and durable economic model remains very much intact. In fact, our performance through the COVID crisis, particularly the strength of our digital business, is giving us confidence hitting the $2.5 million AUV mark earlier than we have previously expected. We continue to expect margins of around 25% at that sales level. Same time, we are aware that the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus pandemic makes it difficult to predict the near-term and medium-term impact and therefore we are not providing fiscal 2020 comp guidance. Having said, Q3 margins and EP S will likely remain bumpy as we continue to make further investments in our people, our business and our communities. Specific to the margin, we expect it to be in the high-teens based on continued price volatility and a few ingredients, including avocados as we transition from Peruvian to Mexican fruit as well as higher labor cost given the reopening of our dining rooms. However, if we see no major COVID-related market regression in the fall, we expect our sales to continue building, which could lead to Q4 being the first quarter where margins and earnings begin to normalize. And this should help set us up for a successful 2021. We ended Q2 with $935 million in cash, restricted cash and short-term investments and no debt, which gives us a strong balance sheet, along with a $600 million untapped credit facility with which to continue to navigate the crisis. Our team remains focused on reducing non-essential controllable costs and judiciously spending and return generating projects to preserve liquidity. I am pleased report that we generated positive free cash flow in the second quarter despite essentially normal level of growth CapEx investment, which we believe is the right thing to do and will payoff in the long-term. Furthermore, assuming a comp improvement, we are seeing continues that gives us greater confidence in our potential to generate positive cash flow for the rest of this year, which will help support ongoing strategic investments. While we didn\u2019t buy back any stock in Q2 in order to preserve cash and we likely won\u2019t over the foreseeable future, we are open to revisiting the program and returning excess cash to shareholders once the environment stabilizes. During the second quarter, we are delighted to have opened 37 new restaurants, with 21 having a Chipotlane. We recently announced a milestone with the opening of 100th Chipotlane and these formats continue to perform very well and have a higher overall digital mix and recent weeks is approaching 60%, but about two-thirds being from the higher margins, order-ahead and pick up. Also, if you look at the sales of our Chipotlane cohort, of the 13 Chipotlane that are in our comp base and therefore opened well before COVID, sales are over 10% higher than the non-Chipotlane comp restaurants in the same opening period, while the more recent openings during COVID are actually 30% higher. We recently relocated 3 restaurants out of Chipotlane and we remodeled 3 more and all are seeing higher sales so far. These great results are fueling our desire to open more than 60% of new restaurants to Chipotlane this year, with the goal of exceeding 70% in 2021. Opening more Chipotlanes will enhance customer access and convenience as well as increase new restaurant sales, margins and returns. Given factors out of our control, there was a pause in new ground breaks during April, but we started construction again as soon as regions began reopening, but we continue to build the units currently and expect to have a sequentially higher number of openings in Q3. There remains uncertainty around a potential spike in COVID cases in the fall, which makes it difficult to offer 2020 new restaurant opening guidance at this time. However, we remain confident in the long-term opportunity to more than double the number of Chipotle restaurants in the U.S. And in fact, our strong financial position along with less competition for high-quality sites as our other businesses pulled back is allowing us to build a robust new unit development pipeline. As a result, we expect to see an acceleration in the number of new units open in 2021. In closing, despite uncertainty about the near-term impact of COVID, we are very excited about our future given the strength of our brand, our talented employees, a solid liquidity position and the resiliency of our economic model. And with that, we are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi, good afternoon. Congratulations on learning the business so quickly. Brian, I have a question about some of the new customers that you think you have acquired since the start of the pandemic. I was wondering if you could perhaps give us a sense of how big of a contribution to sales that new customer layer has brought? And then secondly, I guess what is your tactic or plan to try to keep those folks in the fold as you move forward? Thanks. Brian Niccol : Sure. Yes. Thanks, David. So, the bulk of our digital customers that we have gained as we mentioned in our comments, a lot of them are new customers to the business. And obviously, since dining rooms have not reopened, they have yet to experience the business or I should say dining is reopen fully right. They have yet to experience the business from that access point. The good news is because so many of these new customers came through our digital business, the bulk of them also signed up for our rewards program. And so we have created these journeys that are targeted to new customers, existing customers, whether they are light, medium or heavy. And what we are seeing already with these journeys is we do have the ability to influence behaviors, whether it\u2019s getting another occasion or getting them to add on to an occasion that they are already doing with us. So, what I would tell you is a lot of the digital growth came from new customers. The thing that\u2019s nice about that is they are in our rewards program, a lot of them. And what we are seeing already is really great progress on using the data to then influence their behavior going forward. David Tarantino : Got it. Makes sense. And maybe I will try a slightly different angle, so I think you mentioned your dine-in business or traffic way down 37% or running down 37%. First, can you clarify was that for the quarter or for the \u2013 I guess the quarter to-date period in July? And then I guess what \u2013 what I guess percentage of that number do you think is people that maybe you have shifted into the digital channel versus not? Brian Niccol : Yes. I mean, one of the things to keep in mind, David, is our entrees per transaction are significantly up. So, we have not seen as you think about our sales performance, we still have kind of the same gap that we historically have had on call it check and number of entrees if you use entrees as a transaction proxy. And so what we are definitely seeing is people are slowly, but surely returning to the dining room. But the bulk of what we are seeing is all the huge gains are in, I would say, more entrees per transaction coming from our digital business. So, the in-store ordering obviously we only have reclaimed about 40% to 50% of that business. And a lot of the opportunities still will be reclaiming that in-store business as people get more confidence to come back into the restaurants. But the same token, what we are seeing is a nice increase on entrees per transaction order with the digital business. So, I think some of the customers that have shifted from in-store to digital, what we have seen is their tickets have gotten bigger as they are ordering as groups. So, that helps explain why we are down in the dining room, because you just don\u2019t have the same occasions that you used to have with people driving to work and having that lunch individual occasion, but we are picking up the entrees, I think, through our digital business is the way it is way to think about it. So I think we mentioned in the script right order-ahead is up like 140%. Delivery is up 125%. And then obviously, as we continue to get the dining rooms, operating closer to full capacity, I think we will continue to make progress on the transactions that occur in the restaurant as well. David Tarantino : Right, Brian. Thank you very much. Brian Niccol : Yes. Operator : The next question is from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please go ahead. Peter Saleh : Great, thanks. I want to ask about the Queso Blanco, I think you guys had indicated that you saw pretty substantial high teens attach mix with that just talk about what you did differently there and how you can apply some of those learning\u2019s to maybe some of the new products you plan to launch over the course of the year? Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. Well, for starters, the Queso Blanco, I think was a huge improvement over the prior Queso. And then I think that the team did a really nice job of doing was doing the marketing to those that were already Queso users, as well as people that you may have tried it in the past, but have not purchased it in a long time. And so, I think the team did a great job of using our data to do very targeted marketing, and then the advertising, I think that they ran on a more broad scale based did a nice job of bringing to life. What was different about this Queso and look, the learnings that we have gotten with using our data to drive attachment, I think is something we will be able to use with beverages we will continue to use, frankly, with all sorts of programs coming down the pike. So we feel really good about how Queso Blanco has performed. And I am also really proud of what we have learned in how we can use up this database to better inform our customers what is available and what is right for them so that we get a better attachment in each ticket. Peter Saleh : Thanks. Very helpful. Just a question on the development going forward, I think in the past, one of the governor\u2019s on development and growth, going faster has been just finding enough people. I think the environment that was such that it was tough to find enough employees. Do you feel like that has changed for you? I know capital is not an issue seems like real estate is not the issue. So do you have any restraints on finding enough people to go faster on the development side? Brian Niccol : Yes, I would say, it\u2019s two things on the people. One was having access to hire the additional people and then two was having, I think the people culture and capability in place that when we brought these people on they quickly could be trained and learned he Chipotle way of executing our business. And I think Scott and our HR leaders, Marisa, and all the folks in the field have done a phenomenal job of doing a really good job of recruiting the right people. And then when we recruit them, we are able to train them so that they are ready to go to open a new restaurant or takeover a restaurant in the event, we need to move with an apprentice or a manager to a new restaurant. So we feel like we got all the components to really continue to have success with opening new restaurants, access to really good people the right people capability in the operating model for these people to get trained and ready to roll. And then as you mentioned, the returns continue to be really, really strong because we are able to have access to really good real estate and then we have got all the different access points whether it\u2019s Chipotle just a traditional Chipotle. Peter Saleh : Alright, thank you very much and congrats on the quarter. Brian Niccol : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Katherine Fogertey with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Katherine Fogertey : Great. Thank you. The quesadilla being offered as a digital-only item in test, can you walk through maybe the learning\u2019s of prior Stage Gate tests, maybe what you saw with carne asada when you launched it initially as digital only, that gave you confidence that this digital only strategy will work. And kind of in that same vein, are there other items or even other day parts now that you are committed to kind of digital only offerings that might fit well here? Has that expanded or changed the potential for menu innovation going forward? Thanks. Brian Niccol : Yes, thanks. Thanks for the question. Yes. So one of the things it\u2019s been a nice benefit of all the growth in our digital businesses, we now have scale where, we are doing over a million dollars of business of this digital make line, right. And we have got some restaurants doing well beyond that. And what we have found is, we can have success providing digital only menu items. So, we started \u2013 we kind of dipped our toe in the water when we did lifestyle bowls. And we have kept that going. And what we have seen early days is people are willing to do the app/digital experience in order to have access to a quesadilla. And we feel really good about what we have seen in the early days of the test that we have got going. Obviously, we want to finish the test out. But what I would tell you is the things we have learned in the stage-gate process was just that, which is a huge improvement over making a quesadilla on the frontline with our new approach. But once we started to get meaningful scale, we realized you know what, we don\u2019t even need to put that challenge in front of our operators on the frontline, because we can run it through this digital business. And everybody gets a better experience. The team member has a better experience in the restaurant. The customer gets a better experience from a speed and having the product ready to go when they show up and then the product itself I think you might have heard me talk about this with our digital business, you kind of make your reservation for when you are going to get your quesadilla. I mean, it is Chipotle\u2019s food is really good. And this quesadilla is really good. But when it\u2019s really hot and it\u2019s right there when you reserve your time, it\u2019s extraordinary. So, we feel like it\u2019s hitting on all the marks you would want, better operational experience, better experience for the customer, arguably better food experience. And then operationally, it plays really well in our throughput initiative so that folks in the frontline can really continue to stay focused on speed and that our digital make line is really focused on being on time and accurate. So, we are feeling really bullish. The good news is this does open the door for additional innovation. And Chris and the team are working through what are things we could be doing that are dedicated to the digital make line. And you will see us continue to test those in our stage-gate process. While we still do things like cauliflower rice, which, frankly are going to be both on the frontline and the digital make line. So, we are feeling very optimistic about what our ability is going to be to your point to open kind of that innovation spectrum using the digital make line, whether it\u2019s state parts or menu while we can protect the integrity of our throughput model on that frontline. Katherine Fogertey : Great, thank you. Brian Niccol : Yes. Operator : The next question is from Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Nicole Miller : Thank you. Good afternoon. Could you dig in a little bit to direct and indirect, so I understand digital order-ahead is up 140%, delivery is up 125%. If you isolate delivery, how able are you to keep the consumers coming directly to your app? And I imagine clearly that changes from month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, but how do you keep that in balance, please? Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So, right now, it\u2019s pretty evenly split between marketplace and our own app experience. And the thing that I think you have seen us done is over time we can run very targeted efforts within our app into our rewards customers to incentivize them to stay within our app for that delivery occasion. The thing we also like about our \u2013 frankly our delivery app execution is we can control more of the variables on delivery fees as well as menu prices, so that we can also incentivize behaviors towards our app as well. And then obviously, the big differentiator is you continue to get rewards points when you do delivery through our app versus using a third-party. So, we are feeling really good about the growth that we have seen in our white label business and continues to be an access point that we are going to continue to drive, because it does still appear to be a unique occasion. Nicole Miller : That\u2019s very helpful. I will just ask the second and last question and admittedly, it\u2019s as much about Chipotle as it is trying to understand the consumer behavior at a very high level. When you think about July there is many reasons for your rebound, I just want to understand, what would you be willing to tell us about week-to-week or region-to-region? So, in big restaurant geographies, there is less mobility, I know, California would be the most obvious. I am very curious to understand if the customer maybe doesn\u2019t go back into a dining room that\u2019s understood. And I am wondering if that drives them more and more to Chipotle or a drive-thru in general and more and more to digital? Brian Niccol : Yes. I mean, look, what we have seen Nicole is the regions that opened the earliest, I would say we have made the most gains in comp. And the thing that has been really promising is the digital business has remained sticky, even while we have seen dining room business make a come back, okay. And I think we have mentioned this, our Chipotlanes, we just now have 100 of them or just over 100. We have seen that Chipotlane business stay robust and outperform our system. And I think there is a consumer behavior, where even if they want \u2013 even if they are going into the dining room, they are still taking it for takeout. They are not sitting down and eating at least what we are seeing to-date, it\u2019s come in, get your food and go for the most part. And digital was still I think, perceived as even more convenient, that coming in, building it and then going. So I think you are going to continue to see that. And obviously California rolled back some of the in-dining room experience So, we have quickly pivoted to just relying more heavily on our order-ahead business, which fortunately Chipotle has those access points where we can pivot depending on what happens, state by state, municipality by municipality. So, I am hoping that we don\u2019t have to go backwards before we can go forward on this proposition, but I think we are positioned nicely to be able to weather whatever way we need to bop in order to get through the next couple of months. Nicole Miller : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : The next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Sara Senatore : Great, thank you very much. I wanted to just follow-up on questions about the delivery the decision to kind of pullback on promotions and anything you might be seeing there early on, just is the easiest way to think about it that now order-ahead is growing 20 percentage points faster than delivery and that\u2019s how we should think about the elasticity or is that not really the full weight of that? And are you seeing those sales shift to order-ahead, so kind of from your lowest margin sales to your highest margin, just any kind of color? And on that front, the implication is that, that should be helpful for margins. So I was just trying to sort of square that with Jack\u2019s guidance for kind of high-teens versus the 20% run-rate that we saw when you were kind of spending heavily behind non-delivery. So, just anything on the top line and then how to think about the implications for the margin? Brian Niccol : Yes. So hey, Jack, why don\u2019t I start and then I will hand it over to you. Does that sound good? Jack Hartung : Perfect. Yes. Brian Niccol : Okay. So obviously, one of the things that occurred as soon as if we kind of rewind on the quarter, right, everything moved to off-premise and you had a huge shift to delivery that over time as we got people into delivery and into the digital business, they learned about the other access mode of order-ahead and pickup. And so what I think people have discovered is, you know what, from a value proposition standpoint, I can skip the delivery fee, I can skip some of the waiting if I order-ahead. So we have heard from our consumers as you look at like qualitative side of this, hey, look the convenience of ordering ahead and picking up was something they discovered as a result of bringing them into our business through the delivery channel, which I think is kind of surprising. I don\u2019t think people would realize that people would join the Chipotle digital system because they came in through the delivery occasion. We brought them into the system and then we gave them the experience of the order-ahead. And what\u2019s been nice is we have seen that there are occasions where people want the convenience of delivery, because I can\u2019t get to a Chipotle, but they also really value the ability to order-ahead and go pick it up, because it frankly puts them even in more control of the convenience that they want. And look, they can avoid some fees, right. They don\u2019t have to pay delivery fees, service fees or what have you when you look at whether it\u2019s marketplace or white label. And so what we have pivoted to now is we did put in the dollar delivery fee versus being free the whole time. And I do think some people view and always it worth paying the delivery fee or should I go ahead and just hop in my car and pick it up. And luckily for us, we have made it very convenient for people to make that trade-off. With that said, the delivery occasion appears to be a very unique occasion that when people want to do it, they are willing to pay the delivery fee or the added price associated with delivery. So, we see them as working really well together. But over time, we obviously want to migrate that delivery business to not just be an acquisition tool, but to also be an occasion where we don\u2019t mind the trade-off between delivery or order-ahead over time. And I think that\u2019s what Jack was alluding to in his comments. So Jack, I will hand it over to you. Jack Hartung : Yes. Thanks, Brian. Yes, Sara. So, when you look at I talked about June being a pretty clean month, our margin was 20%. I think that gives an idea that when we normalized the P&L, we can bounce back, we are only 12% during the quarter, but the first couple of months of the quarter had big investments in terms of free delivery. We did start charging the dollar delivery. So, we went from zero to $1 in June and that helped contribute to the higher margin during that period. There is no question that our margin potential as we experiment with and we figure out which levers to pull with between delivery fees and the menu price with delivery that we think there is more upward potential with that margin going from 20% and getting back to more like a 22% when we are at a $2.2 million volume, but we are going to experiment in Q3. So I would call Q3 more of a learning quarter, not a recovery of the margin quarter. That\u2019s why I signaled that Q4 could be the first quarter that we actually see a more normalization of that, of our overall margin. So, we will learn in Q3, we will figure out what to do in Q4. And then also, Q3 is going to be hit by avocados. We have to do that transition back to Mexican avocados. And we are looking at potentially higher prices. We are still picking up some of the higher price of beef, even though beef has begun to normalize, that\u2019s going to hit us as well. So I just want expectations in Q3 to be \u2013 there will be some bounce back on the 12%, but it\u2019s not going to stay at that 20% and then we are going to looking ahead to Q4 in the next year and everything that we are saying we have confidence that our March potential is as intact as it\u2019s ever been. Sara Senatore : Okay, great. I just \u2013 if I can ask one housekeeping you said that there is a 2.7% negative impact that come from the Northeast and international, are we right in thinking that Northeast is about 20% of your stores and maybe bit more than that in sales, is that sort of the order of magnitude? Jack Hartung : It\u2019s in \u2013 I would say, Sara, it\u2019s in that maybe 15% to 20%. It\u2019s one of 8 regions. And so it obviously was hit the hardest. So, I would have to go back and check 20% might be a little on the high side. Sara Senatore : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John Glass : Thanks very much. I wanted to just go back to delivery as well. How incremental has \u2013 the adding the extra incremental third-party delivery provider spend to comp? How do you measure that? Are they all providing the right level of delivery service, you are just using the one, DoorDash for that service and really just relying on the marketplace? And Brian, I just want to also make sure I understood, you are saying 50% of sales in June are delivery, half of them \u2013 50% are digital, half of that is delivery. So, 25% of your sales now is delivery, is that right and what would that have compared to pre-COVID? Brian Niccol : Yes. So let me unpack that. To answer your first question, we use all the major aggregators for the third-party delivery. We are only using DoorDash for our in-app, white label delivery. And what we have seen is as we brought on GrubHub and Uber Eats. And we obviously already had Postmates with DoorDash. Each time we brought on people, we have seen incremental customers come into the business for the delivery channel. Specifically, we are watching this from delivery transactions. And it\u2019s pretty consistent. I think we have heard over and over again and from what we have done our analysis on the others 20% to 30% overlap with some of the big players. So we definitely have seen a nice uptick in our delivery business. Then to answer your question on our digital business, think of the digital business as roughly 50% of sales and half of that or almost a little more than half is order-ahead. And then within that other half that right now is delivery, think of that as another like, call it 60 :40 split of marketplace and white label is kind of the way to think about it. So \u2013 and we have seen nice growth, I think, as we highlighted in both the order-ahead business and the delivery business. John Glass : Thank you. And then as a follow-up, you talked about the dine-in business being down, how many \u2013 what percentage of your store base is in urban cores that rely on that lunch business that probably doesn\u2019t exist in much more fashion, how much headwind is that and how much therefore could that come back as we go back to work over the next 6 sort of months? Brian Niccol : Yes. I think, John, I think it\u2019s around 150, maybe a few more restaurants where there are in those really, called the dense urban setting. But I think in general dining rooms will benefit as that lunch occasion comes back with people going back to work in a more normal pattern versus the heavy skew right now, which is the work from home environment. John Glass : Got it. Thank you. Brian Niccol : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from Jake Bartlett with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Jake Bartlett : Hey, thanks for taking the questions. My first is try to let me better understand that the performance of stores when they open dining rooms, how much of an overall lift that is? And then you mentioned that 85% of the stores have dining room or patio? Did you break that down to tell us what percentage are the dining rooms open, just alone right now? Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So the last part that\u2019s pretty 70% are dining rooms and then there is like 15% that are patio only. Okay. And then your question on when the dining room opens, what type of lift do we see? It\u2019s a gradual build back. What we have seen today, on average is we have recaptured about 40 to 50% of that dining room business. But it\u2019s a gradual thing, it\u2019s like every week goes by, I think consumer psyche starts to build with the idea of going back into the dining room. Again, the bulk of that is people end up still taking it off premise to eat versus actually sitting down in the dining room because remember, even when we have these dining rooms open, in some cases only 25% of our seats available. So, it\u2019s very limited seating to sit in the dining room. Jake Bartlett : Got it. Just to understand that that better, having such a kind of it seems like there is a minimal impact of people sitting. So what\u2019s the big change in terms of the consumer behavior when you open up the dining room, you have already had people, able to come in and in order by standing in line so I mean, I guess I am a little confused as to why would change the sales so much yet it doesn\u2019t seem like the actual dining in is very material? Brian Niccol : Yes, I think it has more to do with the consumer psychology of going to restaurants versus doing it all from home. or in your car. Okay. Again, in even I think I might have shared this with some of you in prior meetings. As I\u2019ve gone into the restaurants and talked to folks that are in the restaurant, a lot of them are like, thank heavens, you guys are opened for me to sit down because I\u2019m just tired of eating in my car. I am tired of eating at home. There is a consumer psychology to the idea that more things are open. And therefore are more mobile, and I\u2019m out and about. So that\u2019s what our research shows. And, as you talk to consumers, that\u2019s the feedback we get. Jake Bartlett : Got it. And then real quick just on pricing and I was hoping you could provide what I don\u2019t think you have what traffic and overall check growth was. And we also found some menu pricing recently taken in markets like California, if you could maybe confirm that or just talking about your strategy for taking menu price. This year I know in years past, it\u2019s been kind of concentrated over a month or two any color on your strategy for taking price this year? Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So we have been very limited in our pricing, because of just I think the nature of the consumer psychology right now. But one thing we have done from a pricing standpoint is we have gotten very strategic with our partner at Fishbowl. And there are places like California where minimum wage moved. And accordingly we did some pricing action to go along with some of the minimum wage movement. So that might be what you are picking up. But it\u2019s very and even that is not market wide. It\u2019s very still strategically executed, on a restaurant by restaurant basis. But I think that\u2019s what you are referencing is you probably saw some of the pricing moves in conjunction with recent minimum wage movement that we are pretty significant minimum wage movements. Jake Bartlett : Right. And then adjust the traffic in the check? Brian Niccol : We don\u2019t bring that out. Go ahead Jack, sorry. Jack Hartung : Yes, I think Brian alluded to it earlier, the transaction has changed the group size has changed significantly, both because people have moved to digital and digital is a higher group size and then even within the order in the restaurant, the group size has changed and I think that\u2019s because we set up, the person working and going out to lunch, maybe with a group, but they are all paying themselves. Now, it\u2019s going to the restaurant and then ordering for the family. So, I think a better way to look at it is when we have the 9.8% negative comp during the quarter, if you look at just entrees, because an entree kind of lines up with a person, entrees were down about 15%. And what that suggests is there is a 5% effective lift in the check and that would have come from a couple of points from menu prices. We also saw a bigger incidence of steak. People are buying steak more and that is a higher priced item. And then the attachment with queso so \u2013 I think that\u2019s the best way to think about it. And I think as we go from a negative 10 into a positive comp situation, it\u2019s going to be a similar gap where people are still buying steak more, they are still buying queso and we still have this small menu price. So, I think you are going to still see a kind of 3%, 4%, 5% gap between our sales and our transactions. I think that\u2019s probably the best way to think about it. Jake Bartlett : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles : Great. Thank you. Jack, a two-part question for you. Now that you are at 100 Chipotlane locations, I am curious what the early read has been on cannibalization if you prefer sales transfer are relative to what you see typically when you open a traditional store near an existing store. And then my follow-up was just now that you have line of sight to development plans through 2021 and perhaps at this point even visibility into 2022 although not finalized. Are you able to extrapolate out or express your desire for what mix of stores Chipotle will represent, will you reach that milestone 5,000 U.S. locations? Jack Hartung : Yes, Andrew, thanks for the question. We are not seeing anything unusual in terms of impact. We open up a Chipotlane versus another restaurant. I mean, you might see the impact that we expect to be a little higher, a little lower, it might be higher, but the volume is higher. The volume in the totaling is higher, so nothing unusual or nothing concerning there whatsoever. We do have internally what we would like to see over a, call it a 3 to 5-year period. And it\u2019s not ready for us to disclose yet. But we are looking at individual markets, some of our oldest markets and looking at we may not be opening up a lot of restaurants in our Denver, our Kansas City, some of the earliest markets, but we do have old restaurants there, where we can look at relocations and rebuilds. In fact, in my prepared comments, I mentioned that we did 3 remodels and added a Chipotlane and 3 relocations and added a Chipotlane. And the way I think about that is we are doing some early tests, call it, running it through the stage-gate to see how these restaurants perform. And as they perform well in the first 6 that we have done, have come out of the box with a higher sales. We are going to look to add more relocations, more remodel so that we can bring more Chipotlane, not just through new stores, but through these other approaches as well. And the good news is in this environment our landlords are more willing to work with us to do a remodel and if they are not willing to work with us on a remodel, there is a site across the street that we will take a look at as well. So, we think the opportunity to move more Chipotlane over the next 3 to 5 years is pretty encouraging. Andrew Charles : Jack, I also just have one bookkeeping question I have. Can you speak to labor costs that 28.2%, the implied labor dollars per store actually declined 90 basis points? It\u2019s obviously a very impressive dynamic when considering the investments that were made in supplementing team member wages as well as manager bonuses. Can you speak to some of the talent in the quarter to help better understand what is temporary and what is enduring within that favorable labor expense? Jack Hartung : Yes. Well, listen, our labor as a percentage of sales was up and it was up because we had the assistance bonus and we have some discretionary bonuses for our managers, but we have some stores that were closed for a while, we have lower sales. And so the labor hours we will schedule with lower sales is going to go down and that might be why you are seeing a just lower absolute number. When you look at just as a percentage of sales, about two-thirds of the increase as a percentage of sales was from the bonus and assistance pay, about one-third of it is because of de-leverage going forward. And the other piece that\u2019s in there, we have some labor efficiencies, Scott and his team out in the field, did a really good job on navigating making sure we had the right number of people show up. Early on, that was hard to get the store staff, our stores were staffed, they were efficient. When you see volumes move up and down, it\u2019s very hard to staff the stores. Well, they did a great job. And I think part of that is also we expected and we saw some efficiencies with the digital make line as well. So now in terms of Andrew, what carries forward in terms of those efficiencies \u2013 some of that depends on how much of the business stays digital. If 50% of the sales stay digital or somewhere in that ballpark, let\u2019s say even 40% some of those efficiencies will pass through, too early to put a number on it yet, but I think our teams did a great job and to do an average of $1 million. And in some cases, Brian alluded to it $2 million and even greater on that digital make line, with fewer labor just gives us a lot of optimism about what we can do in terms of sales and what we can do in terms of profit margin as well. Andrew Charles : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Jeff. Operator : The next question is from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Lauren Silberman : Hi, thanks. I wanted to follow-up on the commentary regarding the June AUV run-rate of Q2 and 20% restaurant margin the 200 basis points differential from the framework. Is it primarily driven by delivery costs? Or are there any other costs to consider? And then is there any offsetting benefit from the shift to the more margin accretive order-ahead occasions? Brian Niccol : The biggest piece is delivery for sure. There is some other pressure, Beef was a little bit of pressure our customers buying more Beef was a little pressure and we are selling fewer drinks. And so, drinks are very accretive to margins and we are selling fewer of them. So there is other things that we are in there. But by far the biggest piece, the piece that we can act on is the delivery piece. We know that if delivery stays at this, this current level, that that the higher delivery fees is going to be a permanent impact on our margins. And that\u2019s why we are going to do some experimentation in Q3. The other pieces are going to work their way out. We do think that especially with tractor beverages we are going to sell more beverages. We suspect that there will be some shift back, away from beef to other menu items. If not, we will need to understand that a little bit more, but that there are a number of things but by far the delivery fees is the biggest piece. Lauren Silberman : Great. And then with regards to the loyalty program, now 15 million members, one of the fastest, but not fastest, in restaurant history, what do you think is driving the outsized adoption of Chipotle, is it faster than you originally expected? And then just thinking about the composition of the loyalty program members what portion is light, medium and heavy users? Brian Niccol : Yes, so obviously the adoption of the rewards program has exceeded our expectations, and it\u2019s gone really well. And, obviously, with the fact that so many people switch to our delivery and digital business over the last couple months, really enabled us to get people to engage in the rewards program. The thing that has been really refreshing is a lot of folks that have joined our rewards program have been new users or light users. And so, we are already using these customer journeys to start influencing behaviors, so that, we can have them be a more frequent customer. And I think that is going to prove to be a nice tailwind for us in the future. Because I don\u2019t think we are done at 15 million, I think 15 million is going to become, you know, 20 million and so on and so forth. And as everyday goes by, we learn more and more on how to use that data to better influence, light, medium and heavy users behavior. Lauren Silberman : Any color, I guess the magnitude of light, medium versus heavy, users in the program? Brian Niccol : We have not broken that out. So, what I can tell you is we are really pleased with the mix that we are seeing a light medium and heavy users. Lauren Silberman : Thanks very much. Operator : Next question is from Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Chris Carril : Hi, thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to ask about how you are thinking about store formats going forward so clearly the current environments validating the opportunity with Chipotlanes. But are you rethinking at all any other aspects of the restaurant perhaps around? How much in restaurants eating is necessary going forward? And do you think there is an opportunity to drive new restaurant returns even higher by contemplating these different formats? Brian Niccol : Well, what I will definitely tell you is we are testing different formats, whether it\u2019s a restaurant that is a Chipotlane-only to a restaurant that's all order-ahead with Chiptolane access point. So we are going to test various formats because our goal is to have a suite of assets that we can then put into a trade area to maximize totally sales out of that trade area. So, the good news is we are seeing these access points all to be truly viable. And I feel like we have got, terrific flexibility in what we want to build, whether it\u2019s in line, tradition, traditional Chipotle all the way to, the freestanding Chiptolane. We\u2019ve got a lot of flexibility in between those two call it bookends, so, and we are going to continue to experiment with what are the, besides we can put Chipotle and then maybe historically we would have said that, and we cannot put Chipotle there but now we can because we have got this different execution and also the scale of our digital business, which supports the additional access points. Jack, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to that? Jack Hartung : No, I couldn\u2019t agree more. And I think this pull forward of the digital business is already allowing us to look in additional trade areas and you can flex the investment and you can flex the size and the access points within the restaurant and so \u2013 but we are going to be thoughtful like we have done with anything and take a stage-gate type approach. So you will see some different formats come out and then when they do well, you will see more of them. Chris Carril : Right. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Brian Niccol : Alright. Thank you and thank you everybody for taking the time to listen and ask questions. Obviously, we are very proud of all of our employees, the way that they have managed the business, the way that they have taken high, high importance on the safety of themselves and their customers. Very fortunate to be a part of this company and leading this company of so many talented leaders, so many talented people that are so committed to Chipotle\u2019s purpose and really honored to be where we are with the Chipotle business. Obviously, we are very proud of the investments we have made in digital and how that has played out for us over the last couple of months. I am very optimistic about how the Chipotle business with now the combination of a very robust digital business, combined with great culinary, great speed and just tremendous value is going to play out in the future. And we are very optimistic about what the future holds both for the health and well-being everybody in this country and then obviously the health and well-being of Chipotle of both the people that work in it and the business that we are going to lead going forward. So, thank you for taking the time and I look forward to speaking with you all soon. Take care. Bye. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Ashish Kohli : Hello, everyone and welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management\u2019s current business and market expectations and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today\u2019s call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Brian. Brian Niccol : Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we are sharing strong third quarter results that highlight ongoing progress in these unprecedented times. However, before I dive into the details, let me acknowledge and thank our incredible Chipotle team members who remain focused on great execution and on advancing our purpose of cultivating a better world for our employees, guests, farmers, communities and shareholders. I\u2019m truly humbled to have the privilege to work alongside this team. Their efforts are helping us not only successfully navigate this pandemic, but highlight that Chipotle\u2019s business model is durable, flexible, and could perform in a challenging environment. As always, the health and wellbeing of our employees and guests continues to be our top priority. We are benefiting from investments made a few years ago, including advanced air filtration systems, sanitizers throughout the restaurant, wellness protocols, and improved handwashing. In addition, we are closely following the recommendations of the CDC and local health departments and have implemented social distancing, wearing face masks, a tamper evident packaging seal for all digital orders, as well as creating the steward role to sanitize high-traffic areas. Collectively, these efforts have made the pivot to enhance COVID-19 safety protocols much less complicated and give our employees and guests confidence that Chipotle remains steadfast in our commitment to keep them safe as we reopen restaurants for in-restaurant dining. We continue to monitor and adhere to state and federal mandates and at present have roughly 10 restaurants closed and about 85% offering limited in-restaurant and/or patio dining, with the remaining being open for to-go services. Since sales troughed in late March, we\u2019ve been able to retain 80% to 85% of our digital sales gains while recovering 50% to 55% of our in-store sales. The stickiness of digital is a key factor in allowing us to deliver strong results, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in making the digital experience as easy and frictionless as possible, as illustrated by the recent launch of our group ordering feature on the Chipotle app. For the quarter, we reported sales of $1.6 billion, representing 14% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by 8.3% comparable restaurant sales growth, restaurant level margins of 19.5%, which is a 130 basis points lower than last year, and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $3.76, representing a decline of 1.6% year-over-year. Comparable restaurant sales were strong in each month of Q3, with August being the high point. Sales trends remained strong in September, even though beginning mid-month we rolled over the successful 2019 Carne Asada program. Beginning mid-September, comparable restaurant sales impressively delivered mid-single digits and this trend has continued in October. The two-year compounded comp stack is a healthy 20.2%, which is similar to the 20.4% pre-COVID level we delivered in Q4 2019 and highlights that our digital system along with running great restaurants with the right leaders and the right culture can deliver outstanding performance despite external challenges. As you can see from the Q3 results, our key strategies continue to resonate with guests and position us to win today while we create the future. In fact, they give us confidence in ultimately having more than 6,000 restaurants and expanding AUVs above $2.5 million with margins at or above 25%. Let me provide a brief update on each of these strategies which are : number one, making the brand visible, relevant, and loved; number two, utilizing a disciplined approach to creativity and innovation; number three, leveraging digital capabilities to drive productivity and expand access, convenience and engagement; number four, engaging with customers through our loyalty program; and number five, running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provide great Food with Integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences. Beginning with marketing, where the goal remains to increase awareness, expand access and grow sales by driving culture, driving a difference, and ultimately driving a purchase. Our team has shown a heightened sense of urgency since the beginning of COVID. They quickly adapted to the evolving environment and experimented with creative social and digital media initiatives designed to help enhance Chipotle\u2019s brand and purpose. Most recently demonstrated by our roundup or change feature that has raised over $2.1 million for organizations supporting underserved communities. We also connected and engaged with guests through our Behind the Foil TV campaign, highlighting real ingredients, real cooking techniques, and real employees. Innovation is a core component of Chipotle and our stage-gate process is a key tool in which we test, listen, and learn from customers and operations before moving to a national launch. Chipotle continues to explore menu initiatives that align with our Food with Integrity standards. A successful example is Carne Asada, which we\u2019re delighted to bring back for a limited time across the U.S. and Canada, as well as in France for the first time. Given that only 5% of U.S. beef meets Chipotle\u2019s strict sourcing standards, we have embarked on a yearlong mission to partner with new farmers, whose practices emphasize quality and responsibility to ensure supply through Q4 and into Q1 of next year. This guest favorite is off to a great start, helping drive sales and transactions again this year. In addition, our upgraded suite of Tractor Beverages that launched in July has been receiving terrific customer feedback. These organic teas and lemonades have elevated our drink options to match our food quality and Food with Integrity ethos. While their full benefit won\u2019t be seen until more customers visit our dining rooms, they have already helped improve drink incidence and position us for ongoing beverage gains. We have two other menu items currently being tested, cauliflower rice, which further enhances healthy eating options at Chipotle and quesadillas, the number one requested new menu item by our customers. The quesadilla is available as a digital-only menu option in a few test markets. Given our digital scale as well as removing operational friction by utilizing our digital kitchens, we are optimistic about the potential for quesadillas to be available nationwide at some point in the future. We are gaining valuable feedback on both of these items, and we\u2019ll update you on their progress as well as other new menu items that are in early stages as they move through our stage-gate process. Next, our digital platform continues to be a big beneficiary of consumers adopting the digital off-premise occasion. A reduction of dine-in services, more people working from home, increased advertising and digital awareness, recent partnerships with Uber Eats and Grubhub and expanded digital capabilities into Canada all have helped attract new customers into our digital ecosystem while increasing convenient access to Chipotle. As a result, Q3 digital sales grew 202% year-over-year to $776 million and represented 49% of sales. Assuming this momentum continues in Q4, we believe digital sales could exceed $2.5 billion in 2020, more than double what we did last year. At this sales rate, our average restaurant delivers a digital AUV of well over $1 million, up from just a few hundred thousand dollars per restaurant a few years ago. During the quarter, about half of the digital sales came via the delivery channel, with the remainder coming from order-ahead and pickup transactions. Both channels continue to grow nicely with delivery benefiting from our expanded partnerships. Order-ahead also remains robust as guests better understand the value offered by this channel as well as the convenience of more Chipotles, which provide an extraordinarily fast experience. I am pleased to report that this strong digital momentum has continued into October with our digital mix remaining in the high-40s. Chipotle has transformed itself over the past few years to a real food and people company powered by technology. A prime example is our rewards program, which has expanded significantly since March and now has 17 million enrolled members. To put this in perspective, this is more viewership than on a typical Monday night football broadcast and gives us a content distribution and engagement network that we can use to elevate engagement and awareness of brand initiatives. Additionally, many of these members are new for Chipotle, not just dining guests who switched to off-premise. Today, our loyalty program is already proving quite fruitful. We\u2019re seeing an increase in frequency across the board with consumers resulting in an extremely strong return on investment. However, what really excites us is that we\u2019re in the early stages of using this valuable tool to understand consumer behavior that will allow us to enhance their journeys and ultimately drive higher sales. We can also utilize these learnings to reengage members if their visits decline, which should efficiently sustain the stickiness of our digital platform. Over the next few years, we expect loyalty to be a key enabler of our digital flywheel as we optimize the use of this important data set. Switching now to our great operations, where today more than ever guests demand and deserve a safe and enjoyable experience as they venture back into our restaurants. We now have two large and growing businesses to manage with digital now comprising roughly half of our sales. Despite COVID challenges, our operations team has done an outstanding job providing consistently prepared delicious food, while improving service levels. Our GMs have maintained a strong presence and stay closely connected to our crew who are at the heart of our culture and our business. A strong culture is a critical part of running successful restaurants. As a leadership team, we continued our listening sessions with employees to understand their experiences and hear their ideas on how we can better support them. In response, we have further invested in our people, including diversity, equity and inclusion training, voter education, and most recently expanding debt-free degrees to include Paul Quinn College, the nation\u2019s first urban work college and one of the oldest historically black colleges and universities in the country. Of those enrolled in our educational assistance program, 85% are crew members and the benefit has a significant impact on their tenure and growth. We\u2019ve seen a retention rate that is 3.5 times higher among employees enrolled in the program, and crew members participating are 7.5 times more likely to move into a management role within the organization. In fact, nearly 70% of our GMs are internal promotions. This is extremely important as we promote and hire new leaders to help support continued growth in our digital business as well as a meaningful acceleration in 2021 new restaurant openings. As we look ahead, we still operate with some uncertainty regarding a potential second wave and the longer term economic impact of COVID. Yet I\u2019m really hopeful that if we do the right things as a company and as a community, we can avoid major disruptions. I\u2019ve never been more confident that Chipotle is a resilient brand committed to fostering a culture that values and champions our diversity, while leveraging the individual talents of all team members. Our core purpose of cultivating a better world through Food with Integrity remains the guiding force in all Company decisions and instills a great sense of pride among our employees, which will far outlast this pandemic. With that, here\u2019s Jack to walk you through the financials. Jack Hartung : Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Despite the ongoing external challenges, we\u2019re pleased to report outstanding third quarter results, which highlight the durability of our economic model and the strong performance of our restaurant teams. Sales were $1.6 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 14.1% from last year, with comp sales grew 8.3%. Restaurant-level margin of 19.5% was 130 basis points lower than last year, and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $3.76, representing a 1.6% year-over-year decline. The third quarter had unusual expenses related to legal reserves, restaurant asset impairments and closure costs as well as our transformation that negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.94, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $2.82. We remain optimistic about the future given our strong Q3 results as well as a great start to this quarter, despite lapping a 13.4% comp in Q4 of 2019. That being said, uncertainty from COVID makes it difficult to provide comp guidance for the remainder of 2020 or for 2021 at this time. Food costs for Q3 were 32.3%, a decrease of 90 basis points from last year due primarily to a menu price increase and lower avocado prices that were partially offset by COVID-related impacts, including elevated beef prices, increased incidence of steak and fewer sales of high-margin beverages. In Q4, we expect food cost to be in the low-32% range as the benefit from a full quarter of delivery menu price increases, which I\u2019ll discuss shortly, will be offset by the launch of Carne Asada. Labor costs for the quarter were 25.3%, a decrease of 130 basis points from last year, and this decrease was primarily driven by sales leverage, partially offset by labor inflation as well as expanded emergency lead benefits to accommodate employees who are directly impacted by COVID. We expect labor costs to be around 25% in Q4 as the benefit of delivery menu price increases will be slightly offset by lower seasonal sales. Other operating costs for the quarter were 16.8%, an increase of 400 basis points from last year, due primarily to higher delivery fees and marketing costs in the quarter. Delivery expenses were elevated year-over-year, given the significant growth we\u2019ve experienced in our digital business, a trend we expect to continue. Therefore, to help improve economics on this important access point, we\u2019re currently testing delivery menu price increases. Remember that we have reduced delivery fees on white label from $3 per order before COVID to just $1, so the net increase to our guests is relatively small, typically about 2% to 3%. We expect this new delivery pricing strategy to be dynamic and evolve over time as we gauge consumer response. And we\u2019ll make adjustments as needed, including perhaps during the approach, market-by-market. Our goal is to ensure we provide convenient access to our guests, so they can enjoy Chipotle how and where they choose to. When customers choose a premium convenience channel that attracts higher costs, our objective is to largely cover those costs within that channel. Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 2.6%, an increase of 60 basis points from last year, due primarily to advertising campaigns to support our digital growth. For Q4, we expect marketing and promo costs to be in the mid to high 3% range to support Carne Asada and for the latest brand messaging under our Behind the Foil campaign. As a result of higher anticipated marketing spend and ongoing momentum in our delivery business, we expect other operating costs to be in the low 17% range in Q4. Looking at overall restaurant margins, we expect Q4 to be at a similar level to what we saw in Q3. While underlying margins are expected to improve by around 200 basis points sequentially in Q4 due to the delivery menu price increase and other efficiencies, these will largely be offset by higher food costs associated with Carne Asada as well as the roughly 100 basis points incremental marketing spend relative to the third quarter. Normalizing to a 3% add in promo spend and without the near-term margin impact of carne, our Q4 underlying margin would be in the 21% range. Looking beyond Q4, we expect COVID-related direct and indirect costs to ease over time, and we have a number of plans in place to ensure we are able to deliver our full margin potential. G&A for the quarter was $133 million on a GAAP basis or $102 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $29 million for settlements of older legal matters and $2 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also includes $84 million in underlying G&A expenses and $18 million related to noncash stock compensation, which includes a $3 million cumulative life-to-date downward adjustment on our 2018 PSUs relative to COVID impacts. As expected, our underlying G&A increased sequentially as we grew headcount and invested in technology to support our growth. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect a similar underlying G&A expense while stock comp will likely be around $22 million, although this amount could move up or down based on actual performance. Turning now to the balance sheet. We ended Q3 with nearly $1.1 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments and no debt, along with the $600 million in untapped credit facility. Our financial strength gives us the opportunity to make ongoing strategic investments in our people, in our business and in our communities, which we believe will benefit us for years to come. While we didn\u2019t buy back any stock in Q3, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate the operating and economic environment each quarter, and we\u2019ll return excess cash to shareholders when the environment is more stable and more predictable. Another area of strength for Chipotle is restaurant design and development. And during the third quarter, we\u2019re delighted to have opened 44 new restaurants with 26, including a Chipotlane. We now have a total of 128 Chipotlanes, including 5 conversions, and performance for these formats continues to be stellar. The digital gap versus non-Chipotle restaurants remains around 10%, and that\u2019s driven entirely by the higher margin order-ahead transaction. Also, if you look at the sales of our Chipotlane cohort, of the 17 Chipotlanes that are in our comp base, and therefore, opened well before COVID, sales are over 10% higher than the non-Chipotlane comp restaurants from the same open period, while the more recent openings during COVID were actually 25% higher. These results further reaffirm our strategy of an accelerated pivot towards Chipotlane sites going forward. And while we continue to expect about 60% of new restaurants with a Chipotlane this year, our goal is to have more than 70% openings, including Chipotlanes in 2021. Opening more Chipotlanes will not only enhance customer access and convenience, but it also increases new store restaurant sales, margins and returns. It\u2019s hard to predict the external environment, but if we assume there are no further COVID-related construction stoppages, we expect to have a sequentially similar or perhaps slightly higher number of openings in Q4. And while the current environment prevents us from being able to provide reliable new store opening guidance for 2021, our development team has built a very robust new store inventory, which under normal circumstances would lead to opening around 200 restaurants next year. As the permitting process and ground breaks become more certain in the coming months, we\u2019ll provide as much visibility as we can around expected openings by quarter and for all of 2021. Longer term, we remain confident in our ability to more than double total number of Chipotle restaurants in the U.S. In closing, I want to thank our incredible teams who continue to collaborate and find ways to safely serve and delight our guests in the face of unprecedented conditions. With a strong brand, a team of committed employees, and broad financial strengths, we feel well-prepared to weather any near-term COVID-related headwinds, and we remain excited about Chipotle\u2019s powerful economic model and therefore, our long-term potential. With that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from David Palmer of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. Jack, you mentioned two things. One was how COVID-related costs were hurting margins. Could you lay that out how you expect those to taper off, how many basis points of margin is that? And then also, just when it comes to the inevitable tapering off of mix on digital, how do you see that playing out in terms of your margins for next year? So for example, if the sales were flat to this in third quarter of \u201821, and the digital mix was say, 25% versus roughly 50%, what impact would that have on your margins as well? Thank you. Jack Hartung : Okay. Thanks, Dave. Let me take the first one first. When we look at the direct/indirect costs that we can identify related to COVID, there is about 100 basis points of margin drag. There is direct costs that we mentioned in the script, for example that I talked about. This is COVID, A, when people are excluded, they either have been exposed or they tell us that their family member that tested positive or may have been exposed, we pay those people to not work. And so, that is a piece, and that\u2019s the most direct piece. There\u2019s also things like during this process, as new customers have come in and they\u2019ve shifted to digital, there\u2019s a higher mix with steak, and steak is a lower margin than chicken. People are buying more burritos, and this is something that\u2019s 100% due to the digital channel. We\u2019re bringing a lot of new customers into the digital channel. They\u2019re starting their journey with Chipotle with burritos. And also, the other thing that we know that our customers tell us is that the burrito travels better than a bowl, and so they\u2019re buying more burritos. They\u2019re also adding tortillas in digital as well. And until recently, those were free and we\u2019ve got fewer beverages. We only, David, have about 5% of our customers. Even though 50% are coming in the restaurant to order, only 5% are staying in the restaurant, and so they\u2019re buying a lot fewer beverages. So, those are the direct and indirect impacts that we\u2019re seeing, and they have about 100-basis-point impact. Hard to tell how these will cycle in and cycle out. Some of these things we can control, like we can stop giving away free tortillas, and if somebody wants to buy the tortilla, they can pay a slight premium of $0.25. Other things like steak mix, we\u2019re going to have to watch and see how that plays out. In terms of looking forward a year from now, really hard to answer that question. I will tell you this, it all depends on delivery. Delivery is the channel that attracts a premium. And the way I would think about this is our margins were hit and the other line item, other expense line item was hit because we had about a 15% shift that was in-store customers that went to delivery. And we all know that delivery brings a much higher cost. So between now and next year and your question, if delivery shifts into in-store and shifts into order-ahead and pick-up, then I would say our margins, for sure, are headed on the way up. If delivery stays the same or increases, we\u2019ll have some challenges. But, we think that the experimentation that we\u2019re doing with menu prices, we think we can offset those prices and get back on to our algorithm that we\u2019ve always talked about with our margins. Operator : Our next question comes from Katherine Fogertey of Goldman Sachs. Katherine Fogertey : Great. Thank you. And Jack, you walked through some of the details about passing on delivery prices through digital channels, I wonder if we could dive into that a little bit more? When you have your initial findings around this, are you seeing any shift in consumer preference here? And then, are you treating white label the same as marketplace? Jack Hartung : Yes. Katy, we are treating white label and marketplace the same in terms of menu prices. So, in a given market, we do have different prices, in different markets, different delivery prices. But if we raise prices, for example, 7% with our white label, we\u2019re doing the same with marketplace. So, everyone is on equal footing there. And then, in terms of -- I\u2019m sorry, what was your other question? Katherine Fogertey : Are you seeing any decline in consumer demand as you are\u2026? Jack Hartung : It\u2019s early still, Katie. But no, we\u2019re not seeing -- we\u2019re not seeing any decline. There might be a slight shift into order ahead and pickup, which we\u2019d be absolutely delighted by because that\u2019s our highest margin transaction, but no noticeable moves to call out so far. Operator : Our next question comes from David Tarantino of Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi. Jack, just a quick clarification on your fourth quarter commentary on the margins. I think, you mentioned restaurant margin on an underlying basis at 21%. Is that a fourth quarter number? Because I know fourth quarter usually is a seasonally lower margin quarter. So, I guess, would that annualize as something higher? Jack Hartung : Yes, David, great, great question. That\u2019s correct. The walk forward that we did was over to the Q4. And you\u2019re right. Q4 and Q1 are typically seasonally lower margin quarters. David Tarantino : Okay, great. And then, on the comps, I\u2019m curious on your thoughts on -- you mentioned you\u2019re cycling much tougher comparisons now related to the launch of Carne Asada. As you look underneath the surface and look at kind of seasonally adjusted sales trends on a daily basis or however you want to answer this, do you think you\u2019re seeing a softening of the trend line, or do you think the underlying business really hasn\u2019t changed, or maybe it\u2019s even improved, it\u2019s just lower because of the comparison? Jack Hartung : Yes. Listen, David. I\u2019ll start and then Brian may want to add on as well. When we shifted from August into early September and then we started a tougher comparison in the middle of September, we saw the dollar sales trends hold up really, really well. And so, we can look at those sales trends. We understand what we expect from a seasonality standpoint. It\u2019s a little more difficult with COVID. But, the sales trends themselves held up really well. So, the only callout that we had was as we compare to these tougher comparisons, the comp is -- we\u2019re delighted with the fact that through the second half of September and into October so far, we\u2019re still solidly in that mid-single-digit. So, the adjustment in the comp percentage is merely because of a tougher comparison to last year. Brian Niccol : Yes. The only thing I would add, David is, hopefully you saw this as we were talking about the two-year compounded performance. We\u2019re getting close to being back to where we were performing pre-COVID, even though we\u2019re still in a COVID world. And clearly, the composition of our sales are different coming from our much more significant digital business. But, we\u2019re feeling really good about the trends we\u2019re seeing in the business. And as Jack mentioned, the good news is, the feedback we get from customers on Carne Asada coming back is they\u2019re really excited to have it back. And as a result, they\u2019re coming back to Chipotle to come and get Carne Asada. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Tower of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jon Tower : Great. Thanks. Just one big a little bit into the Chipotlane stores. I\u2019m curious if you could talk a little bit about the profitability piece of those stores. I think, the 17 or so you had mentioned in the comp base. You had talked about the sales side of the equation, where they\u2019re doing much better on a comp basis and the digital mix is higher. But obviously, you\u2019re seeing in some of your stores today due to the higher delivery fees, some margin pressure. So, can you talk about where that sits today on a comparable basis versus the average store base out there? Jack Hartung : Yes. I was just going to say, there\u2019s a couple of different angles to this. First of all, we look at our comp base, the Chipotlane restaurants are about 10% higher than non-Chipotlane for our comp restaurant in that -- in the same cohort or open for more than 12 months. So right out of the box, that 10% equates to about $200,000 in volume. That\u2019s about 200 basis points in margin right there. The other thing is even though we have about 10% higher overall digital, our delivery in a Chipotlane is actually lower. Okay? So, while overall digital is 10% greater, the order-ahead and pickup is more like 15% greater. So, there\u2019s a shift from the delivery component into the order-ahead, and that enhances margins as well. So, it\u2019s at a minimum, just the sales volume alone is 200, and then that mix shift adds a meaningful margin as well. So, it\u2019s a meaningful change in margin and therefore, a meaningful improvement in returns as well, because the Chipotlane is around $75,000 to $100,000 more expensive than a non-Chipotlane. And obviously, when you go through the math, the returns are extraordinary on that extra $100,000 investment. Brian Niccol : Yes. The only thing I would add to that is I really do think, as Jack mentioned, when you hear the results of our order-ahead business, the additional convenience, the incremental sales, I really think we\u2019re in the phase of proving really the digital drive-thru of the future, and I\u2019m glad we\u2019re on the front end of it. So, obviously, we\u2019re very optimistic about where this can take this. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Charles of Cowen. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles : Thanks. And Brian, a great segue to my question that you spoke about the opportunity for 6,000 ultimate Chipotle locations. And I think, you once mentioned during the quarter that Chipotlanes could ultimately be featured at the majority of Chipotle locations when you get that 6,000 number. So, I\u2019m just curious, how many conversions of existing traditional stores Chipotlanes would this entail the long term? And as you\u2019re presumably getting ready to do some conversions in the coming years, how are you prioritizing which stores are going to be converted from a traditional store to a Chipotlane format? Brian Niccol : Yes. So, I\u2019ll start, and Jack, feel free to add here. We\u2019ve mentioned this I think in the prior calls. Because of the success we\u2019re seeing and the return on the investment that we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019ve pivoted aggressively into our pipeline to have Chipotlanes be the majority of what we\u2019re going to build going forward. So, that will be a big driver of why the portfolio mix will change in the future. And then, we\u2019re in the early days of working through conversions. We\u2019ve done a handful of conversions. And the thing that is I think really good news here is before, I would say there was some resistance by landlords and such to convert end caps, let\u2019s say, we\u2019re not seeing that resistance. And we\u2019re also having some success with the idea of even relocating when it makes a lot of sense to do that. So, it\u2019s going to be a combination of, we\u2019ve got Chipotles that are now 20 years old, and when the opportunity presents to relocate, we look at it from a standpoint of relocating so we can add Chipotlane. And then, we\u2019re starting to see much more traction with landlords being willing to work with us on the conversion, and we\u2019re also seeing nice results from the conversions that we\u2019ve tested to date. So that\u2019s what gives us the confidence of saying that Chipotlane is going to play a major role in our portfolio as you look out into the out years. Jack, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything. Jack Hartung : No, Brian, I think you said it perfectly. The key there is even our oldest markets, those are the sites that are coming up for renewal, either they\u2019re coming up to either exercise an option or they\u2019re coming up to the end of the term. And so, a nice thing there is because landlords are more agreeable, even in our oldest markets, which don\u2019t have a whole lot of new stores over the coming three to five years, we can do a lot of conversions and a lot of relocs. So, we\u2019re very optimistic about it. Andrew Charles : Just a follow-up to that. Is the conversion relocation opportunity for 2021 going to be greater than what you saw -- what you\u2019re able to achieve in 2020 from relo and conversion opportunity perspective? Jack Hartung : It\u2019s early to tell, but I would expect that we would see a step-up in conversions and relos next year compared to this year, and then a step-up the year after that as well. Because when you just go back to 10 and 20 years ago, and these are the leases that are coming up, we had an increasing number of openings, back in that 10-year period, that 20-year period. So, the opportunity should increase every year. So, I would expect to see a step-up each and every year. Hard to exactly quantify at this early stage though. Operator : Our next question comes from Nicole Miller of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Nicole Miller : Just one point of clarification, and it might be self-explanatory, but I hate to make assumptions at this point. Jack, can you just go ahead and find what a mid-single-digit comp is for you? I mean, I tempted o take the comp this quarter and just shave off about 200 basis points from year-over-year compares. But, maybe you\u2019ll help us figure that out if you\u2019re at the lower or the higher end of that range? Jack Hartung : Yes. Nicole, listen. At this early stage of the quarter, when I say -- when we say mid-single digits, we\u2019re thinking out of 4, 5, 6 within that range. Of course, week-to-week, it\u2019s going to change based on weather and other things, but it\u2019s solidly within that range. Nicole Miller : Then a question, Brian, you had mentioned 17 million loyalty members more than some sporting events. So, it really begs the question, at least for me, what is the appropriate level of spend? I think, you\u2019re around the 3% range for this year. And understandably, you would be getting with more sales and more units, more dollars to spend. But, the big global brands, which it seems where Chipotle is headed, they\u2019re spending 5%. So, when would you pull the trigger on marketing? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, I think, the good news is we\u2019re starting to get a lot of leverage out of that 17 million database. And obviously, it\u2019s served us very well, especially during kind of the environment where more traditional marketing channels probably haven\u2019t had the viewership that they\u2019ve had in the past. So, I think, the way we\u2019ve approached it, Nicole, is we want to look at where we\u2019re getting a return for every investable dollar. And the good news is, Chris and the team continue to find great ways to drive purchases with our marketing dollars. So, we\u2019re less fixated on -- in the future, what\u2019s the right percentage. We\u2019re more fixated on what\u2019s going to be the right dollar amount, so that we can continue to get great returns and continue to drive sales the way we have to date. So, I think, I\u2019ve mentioned this in the past, not opposed to spending more when we know we\u2019ve got opportunities that would result in great return. Operator : Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia of William Blair. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia : I guess, a point of clarification. Could you help us understand after the delivery price increase, kind of what the gap is between non-delivery and delivery price points? And then, on development, is $200 million kind of the right yearly cadence at this point, or is there some pent-up kind of flow-over units that are flowing into 2021, and so, we shouldn\u2019t think of $200 million as maybe the right number beyond next year? Brian Niccol : So, I\u2019ll tackle the first one and then tackle your prior question too, and then Jack, chime in. So, look, I think, what we\u2019ve been doing is continuing to test out alternative formats. And the good news, as we\u2019ve gotten more and more scale in our digital business, the alternative formats like a Chipotlane are proving to us that we\u2019ve got more viable opportunities for Chipotle, both in developed markets and emerging markets. So, we\u2019re feeling really good about getting back to 200. And I think, I\u2019ve mentioned this in the past, we think we\u2019ve got the opportunity to go beyond 200. So, as we get further along and we better understand the impact that COVID\u2019s going to have on building going forward, we\u2019ll be able to give you better guidance. But, I think what we\u2019re trying to share with you guys is we\u2019ve got a great pipeline. We\u2019ve got great formats that give us great returns, and we\u2019re feeling really bullish on the ability to get back to building 200 restaurants. And then, our hope is we\u2019ll go beyond that in the future. And then, your other question on -- was it delivery margins, was that right, relative to... Sharon Zackfia : No. It was really from a consumer standpoint. So, what would be the average difference in price points right now with the test between delivery and non-delivery? Brian Niccol : Oh, so -- yes, we\u2019ve got a couple of different tests in place, anywhere from a 7% tests that we\u2019ve got, a 13% test that we have, and we even have 17% test in menu prices. The thing I would remind you is, remember, before COVID, we were charging $3 for delivery. In all those scenarios now, what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve kept the delivery fee at $1, so the effective price on the transaction is only 2 to 3 points higher. So, like, when you look at the total cost, it ends up being about 2% to 3% more than what they were used to paying for delivery before we started promoting the delivery channel, which obviously COVID, I think, was the right thing to do to pivot to that channel and get the digital business going. So, all in all, it flows in the totality of about 2% to 3%. Jack, was there anything on that one? Jack Hartung : No. That was it, Brian. Just, Sharon, to give you an idea, the 7, the 13, the 17, they wash out to on average to be low double-digit kind of increase. But, Brian made the key point about we offset that in our white label with lowering the delivery fee in $3 to $1. So, for folks that are shopping in our white label, it\u2019s a really, really good value. If they\u2019re shopping in marketplace, it depends on what the others are charging for their delivery fee, which we don\u2019t have control over. Brian Niccol : Yes. That\u2019s a good point Jack. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Jeffrey Bernstein : Two questions. One, just as we think about the volumes versus the margin correlation, which you\u2019ve talked about many times in the past, it seems like the two are back to moving lockstep. I think you\u2019ve noted that this third quarter, the AUVs are in the $2.2 million range. And I think, you said the underlying margin would have been 21% or actually 22%, if you back out the 100 basis-point kind of COVID hit. So one, I just want to make sure I\u2019m getting that right. And then, it seems like your peers are talking more and more about maybe doing more with less, perhaps seeing some cost savings through COVID that seem like they\u2019re sustainable. So, I\u2019m wondering whether you\u2019re seeing some of those cost savings, whereas there is potential to see restaurant margin reaccelerate faster than any AUV. And then, I had one follow-up. Jack Hartung : I think, you\u2019re thinking about it right. The key to note is that we know that there is a gap, a temporary gap, some driven by COVID, some driven by other things. But, we know that what it will take to get from where we are today to what the algorithm is. The key to note is that we\u2019re not going to be in a hurry to get there. We know what levers to pull. We know how to close that gap, so we get all the way to that algorithm. We\u2019ll pull those at the right time and the right place, so that we don\u2019t, for example, disrupt consumer demand for Chipotle. But, it\u2019s important for you guys to know that these are levers that we know that we can pull. We know that we can deliver the margin that -- the full margin potential that we know is there, but we\u2019ll be very, very patient in doing it. Jeffrey Bernstein : Got it. And then, just a follow-up in terms of the -- if there was a silver lining to come out of this very difficult pandemic, it does seem like commodity is not a big issue, and you\u2019re seeing nice leverage, labor inflations easing seemingly and you\u2019re seeing some leverage, real estate costs sounds like things are getting better and maybe locations are becoming more favorable. So, I\u2019m wondering whether you see that the same way. And maybe how you\u2019d prioritize the magnitude of those benefits, whether you believe they\u2019re all sustainable or not? Brian Niccol : Here, I\u2019ll get started, Jack. Yes. So, I think, the way we would look at it is, in our business, we always plan for the unexpected. So, our approach has been when opportunities present itself, we want to make sure we take advantage of it. When challenges present themselves, we want to make sure we have plans in place to handle them. You\u2019ve mentioned some things that may prove to be some tailwinds going forward. But, one thing I\u2019ve learned about these businesses, we can expect the unexpected. So, look, where there\u2019s tailwinds, we\u2019ll make sure we capture it; where there\u2019s headwinds, we\u2019ll figure out how to maneuver through it. So, Jack, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything specific to that. Jack Hartung : Yes. Brian, I think that was well said. And we are seeing, for example, our teams in the field are doing a fantastic job, not just the peeping, their team\u2019s sake, not just making sure the customer is safe but also running the business well. And so, they really are doing a very great job. You hinted this in your first question about some opportunities or some savings. They\u2019re doing a great job of managing things like M&R, managing things like food cost. The fact that digital has become a much bigger part of the business. We always charge when somebody orders extra steak and digital, it\u2019s the only way to do it. So, there are some advantages there, and those are helping us along the way. Our goal will be to Brian\u2019s point is to make sure that we can hold out of those as we deal with future challenges ahead of us. Operator : Our next question will come from Peter Saleh of BTIG. Please go ahead. Peter Saleh : Brian, I wanted to ask about the Chipotle\u2019s value proposition. Historically, Chipotle has been a better value for the consumer relative to many of its peers and its competitors. Over the past couple of years, you guys have been raising menu prices and introducing higher price point items like Carne Asada, and now I think you\u2019re talking about raising delivery menu prices somewhat. So, can you talk about the value proposition, how you see it, and any insight you may have into the value scores, especially through the pandemic? Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So, here\u2019s the great news is our value proposition continues to only get stronger. So, you\u2019ve got to remember, 60% of what we sell are chicken burritos and bowls, and those are still great meals purchased for less than 8 bucks on our menus. And even when you look at other channels like delivery where there\u2019s some additional costs associated with it, we still then maintain our same value gap relative to peers because a lot of people are pricing a lot higher than what we are in the delivery channel. So, the feedback we get consistently is the food\u2019s delicious, the customization is unlike anywhere else I get, and the price I have to pay for that at the speed of which I get it, this is still a tremendous value proposition. And I think it\u2019s -- well, I know based on the surveys we put out there, we\u2019re continuing to get feedback that our trust is going up and our value is going up. So, these are obviously customer surveys. But, we feel really good about the strength of the brand because of those metrics where we have strength, which is food quality/food integrity, trust, speed, customization and then not surprising when you have all good things in those areas, you get really good value scores. So, it remains very strong. Operator : Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger of UBS. Please go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Brian, I wanted to ask a bit more about new product innovation and whether there\u2019s much help that you can share on kind of takeaways from some of the products that you mentioned that are in test? And maybe what that\u2019s done to your excitement level, what we\u2019ll call it as it relates to broader rollout eventually? And just related to that, I guess, as the results of this ADA process to date, have they increased the rate of new product rollout as you kind of hone the process and the rate of success as you hone that process over time? Just curious your thoughts there. Thank you. Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. Well, look, we\u2019re feeling really good about the process. We\u2019ve had some really powerful initiatives. Chipotlane is one of them that went through the process. Obviously, menu items like Carne Asada, Queso, Tractor Beverage, these things are all proving that our process works to identify the winners so that we bring those forward. And we do it in a way that protects the integrity of our financial model and the integrity of our operating model, while giving the customer what they want and sometimes leading the customer in food. Some of the things that I\u2019m really excited about is, look, I\u2019m really fired up about this cauliflower rice, I\u2019m really fired up about the quesadilla, for two reasons. One, the quesadilla is proving to be very effective in our test markets in a digital channel execution, which keeps the channel very much engaged for the customer. And I think we\u2019ll continue to make it a sticky and acquisition tool for people to come into the business. And then the cauliflower rice, I think, is just in Chipotle\u2019s wheelhouse of continuing to push real wholesome ingredients done in a delicious way. And I\u2019m fortunate that we\u2019ve got that in Orange County, so I get to have you cauliflower rice with some frequency and it\u2019s just that, it\u2019s delicious. And the guys are working on some additional things that I think we\u2019ve mentioned that you\u2019ll see us continue to roll out into various test markets. But, the good news is, the ones that didn\u2019t do so well, we haven\u2019t rolled those out naturally. So, the stage-gate process is working. The ones that work, we move forward to national, the ones that don\u2019t work, we learn from it and stop the trains from just moving down the tracks. So, it\u2019s working. Operator : Our next question comes from Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Sara Senatore : Just two clarifications, if I may. The first is just, Brian, you said that people are coming back for Carne Asada that\u2019s securing from your customers. I guess, so the implication, as I understand it is that even though your compares are still tough, you do have this extra pull, if you will, on your menu. So, I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but is that right? There are people who maybe don\u2019t come from the menu without the Carne Asada but become when it\u2019s on. So, that was the first clarification. And then, just on the margin, I know you\u2019ve gotten a lot of questions there. Was there any savings from not having dining rooms open? We\u2019ve heard that from some other companies that just being able to sort of from most of the sales through either drive-through or carry-out does allow some labor savings. And I was just curious if that\u2019s true as we think about more normalization of sales? Thanks. Brian Niccol : Yes. So, the first question on Carne Asada, here\u2019s what I think you should know. The good news is even when people come in for the first time for Carne Asada, what we do see is their second or third purchases, they move within the menu. So, they experiment with chicken or they experiment with our regular steak. And it proves to be pretty sticky. So, it\u2019s -- yes, I\u2019m sure we can pull forward some frequency with Carne Asada, we\u2019ll get some new users in with Carne Asada. But the good news is, it proves to be sticky because they love the Chipotle experience. They love the Carne Asada, but they love the Chipotle experience. And so, I think, that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing us in a COVID environment being able to lap a Carne Asada initiative that was widely successful a year ago, because we\u2019re getting both. We\u2019re getting frequency play and we\u2019re getting some new users into the business. And then, your second question was -- can you remind me what the second question was? Sara Senatore : Yes. Just on margins, were there any kind of savings from a different labor metrics, because you don\u2019t have dine-in? Brian Niccol : Yes. So, I think, Jack kind of outlined some of these things where our teams have done a really great job of flexing between the frontline and the digital line. The good news is our frontlines now are open and I think it\u2019s like 90% of our restaurants almost. And obviously, we\u2019re doing really smart things from a labor management standpoint. But, we still operate our dining rooms. And we\u2019ve committed to making the dining room experience really safe. So, we\u2019ve invested in things like the steward, and that\u2019s an important position to give people confidence to come in and get takeout. So, there are some places where we\u2019ve seen efficiencies and we\u2019ve captured those efficiencies. And the teams have done a great job of managing the labor effectively for where the business is, which is now split 50-50 between digital and the frontline. So, I think, where we are able to capture the savings, we capture them. And then, in the other areas where it\u2019s necessary for us to invest to ensure there is a confident work environment for the employee and customer, we do that as well. Jack, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to that? Jack Hartung : Yes. Brian, I think, it was really well said. The other thing that I would just point out, Sara, is that some of the other like traditional fast food, if they have 90% of the business going through the drive-thru, they have almost nobody that\u2019s really pending to the dining room. And so, I know that some folks are hesitant to even reopen the dining room or if they can keep it closed, that will be great. That\u2019s not really an option for us for the reasons that Brian mentioned. We still want to have our frontline staffed and ready to go. We still have half of our sales that are going through that frontline. And so, but having said that, definitely, there\u2019s been efficiency inherent shift of the business going from 20% digital to 50%. And Scott and the team out in the field have captured that efficiency and that has well served. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Silberman of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Lauren Silberman : Just a follow-up on the delivery menu prices. With $1 delivery fee, what menu price increase would be necessary for delivery transactions to be at parity with the dine-in transaction? And is that something that you would explore, assuming the delivery mix sustains at these levels? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, I think, what we want to do is figure out the best way in the channel to capture the additional costs. So, we\u2019ll figure out how we do that, whether it\u2019s through the menu price or if there\u2019s other ways to even be more efficient. But, we want to figure out how we understand the costs and then how we make sure we address those costs in the most effective and efficient way because we want to give the consumer the access that they want. And so, we obviously work through various iterations. And that\u2019s why I think you heard Jack mention earlier, we\u2019re still experimenting with various approaches. Lauren Silberman : Okay. And Brian, now 18 months into the loyalty program, what can you share regarding what you\u2019ve learned about how customers across frequency cohorts use the Chipotle brand differently? And then specific to just customers using delivery, do you see any outsized usage among light users, or new users to the brand? Brian Niccol : Yes. Well, what has been great is the delivery channel has proven to be a great access point and an acquisition tool for our digital system. And what we\u2019ve seen is a nice increase of light, lapsed, new users into the business. Not surprising, we see more of a frequency gain with that cohort group versus somebody that\u2019s a heavy user. The utilization, which is also really nice to see, is as they become more familiar with our app and the ability to order-ahead and do the grab and go, we see people adopt that with some really nice frequency. So, there are those occasions that are dedicated to deliveries, but there\u2019s also these occasions for everybody in these cohorts where the order-ahead proposition makes a lot of sense. And we\u2019re very bullish on being able to use the data and the insights to drive the behaviors around these various occasions that maybe Chipotle before wasn\u2019t top of mind but now they are. Operator : Our next question comes from Gregory Francfort of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Gregory Francfort : Hey. Thanks for the question. I just had one quick one and then another question. Just can you remind me if there\u2019s any big differences in the compares last year being the months? I just don\u2019t know if you\u2019re lapping a particularly tough or easy period in the first part of the month -- first part of the quarter. And then my question is on labor. And can you maybe give us a little bit of the backdrop on what\u2019s happening on the labor front in terms of turnover the ability to source labor? And it seems like you guys have seen -- done a really good job of managing that. I\u2019m just kind of curious if you could talk a little bit about that environment. Thanks. Brian Niccol : Sure. So, the first question is really easy to answer. The fourth quarter, we\u2019re rolling over a plus 13 off of the heels of our successful Carne Asada launch last year as well as a lot of the throughput gains that we made, operationally. So, that\u2019s why we mentioned, starting in mid-September, the rollover got harder. The good news is, when you look at the two-year compounded growth rate, we\u2019re continuing to perform in that 20% range. So, we feel really good about where we are. And then, your second question was -- sorry, I forgot what the second question is. Gregory Francfort : You\u2019re getting a lot from all of us. So, just on the labor side, the ability -- new talent and turnover, just what that environment looks like for Chipotle? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, I think, we\u2019ve got a great employee value proposition. So, not surprising, we\u2019re attracting a lot of applicants. The investments that we\u2019ve made and the way that we\u2019ve handled, I think, this COVID environment in regard to honoring bonuses, providing our employees with restricted stock and also giving them all the tools they need, whether it\u2019s mental health benefits, debt-free degrees, obviously, a lot of the work around diversity and inclusion, all these things, I think, make the job really exciting. And then, you layer in the simple fact, we\u2019re a growth company. Right? So, you\u2019re going to come into this Company, maybe you join as a crew member, maybe you join as a kitchen manager, but we\u2019re going to be building 200-plus restaurants, and there\u2019s a growth opportunity for you, where in the next 18 to 24 months, you could find yourself being a manager running a restaurant. So, that creates stability because people want those opportunities, and it also creates the ability to pull people in to want to become a part of the Chipotle culture and opportunity. So, I think, Scott and Marissa and all of our restaurant leaders are doing a terrific job of sharing the story of, look, we\u2019re a company that cares about cultivating a better world. We do it in Food with Integrity. And we are a people business. We are going to invest in our people and do what we need, so that they can be successful and that their development hopefully results in their ambitions that they have. So, we\u2019re seeing a very-positive situation out there right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Barish of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Andrew Barish : A question on the Carne Asada price premium. I think, you took it up this year. Can you just give us a sense of sort of on margin neutrality, how much higher would it go and just comparing versus sort of your basket of product mix? And then, how much of an impact you expect in the 4Q versus, I think, it was about a 50 basis-point headwind a year ago when you launched it? Jack Hartung : Yes. Brian Niccol : So obviously -- go ahead, Jack. Go ahead. Jack Hartung : Andy, just real quickly, you\u2019re in the ballpark [Technical Difficulty]. Brian Niccol : Yes. I\u2019m not sure if you heard Jack on that. He was kind of faint on that. But\u2026 Andrew Barish : Yes. I didn\u2019t know if it was my phone or your phone. Brian Niccol : No. Yes, he got faint there. But, I think, what he was saying is the good news is Carne Asada is proving to be incremental. And obviously, we priced it such that from a penny profit standpoint, it looks really good. And I think, the numbers that you talked about are pretty consistent with what we see as the margin impact. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol, Chairman and CEO, for any closing remarks. Brian Niccol : All right. Thank you. And thanks everybody for taking the time and for all the questions. I do want to just take a moment to recognize, like even despite being in a COVID situation, this third quarter really I think talks to the power of our brand and the power of our culture. If you just stop and think for a second, we had record sales with a two-year number close to 20%. We did over $1 billion in delivery now, year-to-date. We\u2019re $1 billion of order-ahead business year-to-date. And we have a really strong balance sheet with $1 billion of cash. So, I think we are also at the same time moving our margins on a way to be consistent with the model that we\u2019ve been talking about. And I think, we\u2019ve talked about that quite a bit. And obviously, we continue to invest in our creativity and innovation through the stage-gate process. And I think, one of the things that I\u2019m really excited about is how we\u2019re proving I think the digital drive-thru of the future with Chipotlane, which I think is going to be a huge impact going forward. And I\u2019m really excited to be talking about building over 200 restaurants again. So, we\u2019re obviously going to continue to invest in our people, obviously continue to invest in our culture because we know that results in driving best-in-class operations. And our teams, again, I just want to say a huge thank you. They have stayed focused. They have committed to the COVID protocols, so that we can keep each other safe and can serve our customers in a safe way. And, I think my takeaway from all this is, the brand is powerful, our future is really bright, and we\u2019re going to continue to make progress on cultivating a better world, really through our intention around Food with Integrity. So, I look forward to the next quarter when we can share our results. But so proud of where we are today and just so proud of our team and our culture for how we\u2019ve navigated through these really challenging times of late. It\u2019s demonstrated that when you do right things for your people, you do the right things for your community, you get rewarded with great results. So, thank you for your time. And we\u2019ll talk soon. Bye, bye. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. And you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, Head of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead. Ashish Kohli : Hello, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2020 earnings call. By now you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com. I'll begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the Presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian. Brian Niccol : Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report a strong ending to what has been a challenging year. Even today, a few Chipotle restaurants remain fully closed while only about 60% of our dining rooms are open with reduced capacity, with the rest being available for to-go services. Despite this challenging backdrop, our results demonstrate that Chipotle restaurants with the right leaders and culture along with excellent culinary, can deliver outstanding performance in any environment. Most importantly, none of this would be possible without our dedicated team members that strive to deliver a great guest experience on a daily basis. The pandemic has presented new challenges for all of us and our team has successfully navigated every one of them. I thank our team members for their ongoing commitment to serving our guests as well as supporting each other and could not be prouder of their efforts. Before we dive into our financial results, let me reflect back on 2020 and highlight a few key accomplishments that have helped propel Chipotle's mission of cultivating a better world. These include, a paramount focus on industry-leading protocols that help ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and guests, providing jobs with industry-leading benefits to nearly 88,000 people, and paying out nearly $40 million in discretionary bonuses and assistance pay to our restaurant team members, as well as over $13 million of tuition costs for employees furthering their education; prioritizing diversity, equality, and inclusion efforts across the company; and raising nearly $4 million in support of organizations helping underserved communities; and investing in the future of farming through grants, long-term contracts, and the Aluminaries Project 2.0. As a purpose-driven organization, we're already hard at work identifying ways that we can make a positive impact on the world in 2021. We are optimistic about the future and look forward to continuing to deliver on our promises and passionately play an active supportive role in our communities. Now, let's focus on our business performance where for the fourth quarter we reported sales of $1.6 billion, representing 11.6% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by 5.7% comparable restaurant sales growth; restaurant-level margins of 19.5% which is 30 basis points higher than last year; and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $3.48, representing an increase of 21.7% year-over-year. Comparable restaurant sales were fairly consistent in each month of Q4, due to a combination of factors, including healthy demand for Carne Asada, strength in our digital platform, and the delivery menu price increase. Q1 has also started on a very positive note, with comparable restaurant sales for January accelerating to around 11% despite a double digit comparison. Even with a resurgence in COVID cases, the two-year compounded comp stack in Q4 was a robust 19.9%, which is similar to the 20.2% we delivered last quarter and highlights the resiliency of the Chipotle brand. In light of the ever-changing environment we all experienced in 2020, our full-year performance showed good progress with sales growing 7.1% to reach $6 billion, driven by a 1.8% comp, 161 new restaurant openings, and digital sales of $2.8 billion, which grew 174% versus the prior year. As you can see from these results, our key strategies continue to resonate with guests and position us to win today while we create the future. What really excites me and the entire leadership team is our vision of having more than 6,000 restaurants and expanding AUVs above $2.5 million with margins at or above 25%, all of which is a question of when, not if. Let me now provide a brief update on each of these strategies, which I believe still have plenty of runway. These are number one, making the brand visible, relevant, and loved; number two, utilizing a disciplined approach to creativity and innovation; number three, leveraging digital capabilities to drive productivity and expand access, convenience and engagement; number four, engaging with customers through our loyalty program; and number five, running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences. Beginning with our marketing programs which are generating attractive returns by driving culture, driving a difference, and ultimately driving purchase. Our creative marketing initiatives across both traditional and digital channels continue to be successful in attracting new users to Chipotle, as well as motivating existing customers to come more often. Whether it was switching our Halloween celebration to an entirely digital offering for the first time, unveiling a new line of Chipotle merchandise ahead of the holiday season, or launching Real Foodprint, a sustainability impact tracker that shows how Chipotle ingredients are better for the planet. Our marketing team did a terrific job consistently enhancing our brand and purpose using the right message with the right vehicle. Traditional advertising also remains an important marketing tool for Chipotle. We connected and engaged with guests through our Behind the Foil TV campaign and a new avocado journey spot highlighting real ingredients, real cooking techniques, and real employees. We also featured our making an order spot that highlights the ease of customizing the order on our app to continue to drive awareness of digital ordering. And last week, we announced our first-ever Super Bowl commercial that will air during the second quarter beginning this Sunday. The spot is titled Can A Burrito Change the World, and highlights Chipotle's commitment to cultivating a better world through its real food, sustainable sourcing, and commitment to the farming industry. Supplementing these efforts are a steady flow of new menu innovation that is validated by our stage-gate process, which gives new and existing customers even more reasons to visit Chipotle. Since our initial offering of Carne Asada ended last year, we continued hearing from our guests that they wanted it back. So, we found a way to source more tender cuts of steak that met our Food with Integrity standards and brought it back for a limited time across the U.S. and Canada as well as in France for the first time. The relaunch, which we expect to last through early March is going well, and we're encouraged that the incidence mix is similar to what we saw last year. In addition, in January we launched Cilantro-Lime Cauliflower Rice for limited time across the U.S. and Canada. We're excited to introduce this plant-powered better-for-you option that aligns with the latest health trends and emphasizes the benefits of real food. With only four grams of net carbs per serving, it puts a delicious twist on Chipotle's classic rice recipe by using the same fresh real ingredients and culinary techniques. Early feedback has been outstanding. Cauliflower rice is definitely on trend a great reason for new guests to try Chipotle for the first time or entice existing guests to visit more often and it keeps our Lifestyle Bowls platform top of mind. We have two other menu items currently being tested. The first is quesadillas which is available as a digital-only menu option in a few test markets. We continue to make operational progress and remain optimistic about the potential for quesadillas to be available nationwide in the near future. The second item is our smoked brisket which is currently being tested and showing encouraging results. I personally love the richness of our smoked brisket recipe as it delivers a flavor unlike anything else at Chipotle. We are gaining valuable feedback on both of these items and we'll update you on their progress as well as other menu items that are in early development as they move through our stage-gate process. Moving to the next strategic driver our digital platform which continues to be a big beneficiary from guests adopting the digital off-premise occasion. Q4 digital sales grew 177% year-over-year to $781 million and represented 49% of sales. This was consistent with Q3 digital sales and mix highlighting our ongoing momentum and the fact that Chipotle is top of mind for a lot more eating and dining occasions than we were in the past. We are not stopping there. We've made our digital channel even more convenient with easy ordering in the Chipotle app and website enhancements such as unlimited customization, contactless delivery and group ordering. As a result and I mentioned this earlier, full year digital sales were $2.8 billion representing 46% of total sales and growing 174% year-over-year. What an amazing accomplishment. At this sales rate our average restaurant delivers a digital AUV of $1.1 million. With this success we will not allow complacency to set in. Rather we will continue to look for ways to further enhance our digital ecosystem. For example, we just announced a car-side pickup pilot in San Jose as an additional access point for our guests. In addition we are opening up more and more Chipotlanes and are in the early stages of testing alternative formats like our first-ever digital-only restaurant outside of West Point. This new prototype allows us to enter more trade areas that wouldn't support a full-size restaurant and allows for greater flexibility with future locations. It's early days but this location has outperformed our expectations thus far. During the quarter about half of the digital sales came via order-ahead and pickup transactions or digital pickup orders as we refer to them with the remainder coming from the delivery channel. However, our overall digital mix moved up about 50% late in the quarter as COVID restrictions toughened, largely driven by an increase in digital pickup orders. I'm pleased to report that the strong digital momentum has continued into January with our digital mix remaining in the low-50% range. Another area where we saw a big benefit in 2020 is our rewards program which added over 10 million members in the last year and currently has nearly 19.5 million enrolled members. This gives us the ability to communicate organically with a large and passionate community of Chipotle fans. We have focused on strengthening our creative and analytical capabilities by using predictive modeling to ensure that our members feel known and valued as we elevate their relationship with Chipotle. We strategically share brand and promotional messages with personalized content weekly. In addition we reach customers with dedicated journeys focused on welcoming new members growing frequency and minimizing lapsing behavior. There are preprogrammed touch points in place to drive customer value across their life cycle including a keen focus on retaining digital customers who have experienced the brand in new ways over the last year. Although Chipotle Rewards and its CRM capability have been active for less than two years, we have already made significant progress and have further enhancements planned in the coming months that we expect will continue to drive frequency increases across our customer segments. Finally, I want to spend some time on our restaurant operations, where the team stayed focused on safety, reliability and excellent culinary, as it seamlessly adapted to abrupt changes in guest needs and ordering patterns. This hasn't been easy, especially as the number of COVID cases began to spike and at times impacted our staffing capabilities. But they have been up to the challenge and I'm so proud of our operational leaders and team members. They have been unwavering in the desire and execution of the right things for each other, our customers, our community and our business. And as I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, Chipotle has continued to reward and invest in our team members to ensure we are creating an environment that allows our employees to develop and thrive in their career not only today but also in the future. We offer best-in-class benefits, coupled with training, development and promotional opportunities that foster a learning culture for continual growth. Turnover continues to be relatively stable and we are seeing plenty of great applicants for open positions to staff our expected growth in AUV and new restaurant openings. In fact, we held our first national hiring event of the year called Coast-to-Coast Career Day in mid-January with a goal of employing 15,000 new restaurant team members across the US. We had an overwhelming response and feel fortunate to have a reputation for attracting and developing great talent. In closing, I believe our performance in 2020 was in some ways even more impressive than what we achieved in 2019 and highlights that the Chipotle brand has remained visible and flexible in order to stay relevant. Our ability to pivot and adapt to the rapidly changing needs of our guests is a testament to the durability of our model and the strength of our team members. My sincere thanks to our employees for their passion to make Chipotle a welcoming place for all and a special place to work. As we look ahead, the rollout of vaccines gives us hope that the world can return to a more normal environment at some point during 2021. And I'm optimistic that resiliency will prevail as people want to get back together to share a meal and share some stories. In the meantime, we're ready to navigate through any potential challenges. With world-class talent, an inclusive culture, strong business fundamentals and deep financial strength, we feel well prepared to emerge even stronger post-COVID and continue to serve and delight our guests. With that here's Jack to walk you through the financials. Jack Hartung : Thanks, Brian and good afternoon, everyone. Despite ongoing challenges related to COVID, we're pleased to report solid fourth quarter results with sales growing 11.6% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as comp sales grew 5.7%. Restaurant-level margin of 19.5% was 30 basis points higher than last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $3.48, representing a 21.7% year-over-year increase. The fourth quarter had a non-recurring tax benefit was partially offset by expenses related to legal reserves, restaurant asset impairments and closure costs, transformation expenses and other adjustments, which netted to positively impact our earnings per share by $3.21 leading to GAAP earnings per share of $6.69. For the full year, sales increased 7.1% to $6 billion on a comp increase of 1.8%. Restaurant-level margins were 17.4%, a decrease of 310 basis points. And we generated earnings per share adjusted for unusual expenses of $10.73, a decrease of 23.6% over last year. We had non-recurring tax benefit that was partially offset by expenses related to legal reserves, restaurant asset impairment and closure costs, as well as our transformation that positively impacted our earnings per share by $1.79 leading to GAAP earnings per share of $12.52. While the uncertainty from COVID makes it difficult to provide comp guidance for full year 2021, we remain optimistic about our future prospects as evidenced by a great start to Q1 with January comps accelerating to roughly 11%, despite a very difficult comparison. Sales in last week of January were in the high-single digits with winter weather across the country contributing to the lower comp. Assuming the pandemic doesn't worsen, we expect our Q1 comp to be in the mid- to high-teens range given an easier comparison during the second half of March. Food cost were 31% in Q4, a decrease of 210 basis points from last year and this was due primarily to menu price increases along with better waste control, partially offset by fewer sales of high-margin beverages and higher dairy pricing. In Q1, we expect food costs to remain right around 31% as the benefit from a full quarter of menu price increases will be offset by higher cost menu items such as cauliflower rice as well as slightly higher avocado prices. Labor costs for the quarter were 25.4%, a decrease of 110 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage and efficiencies related to digital orders, partially offset by COVID-related expenses including exclusion pay as well as normal labor inflation. We expect labor costs to be right around 25% during Q1, as expected benefit from sales leverage is offset by ongoing COVID-related expenses. Other operating costs for the quarter was 17.9% an increase of 310 basis points from last year, due primarily to higher delivery fees in the quarter. Delivery expenses were elevated year-over-year given the significant growth in delivery with delivery sales now nearly 25% of total sales. To help improve the economics on this premium access point, we have implemented several delivery menu price differentials with a weighted average being right around 13%. We have seen modest resistance thus far and we'll continue to monitor and adjust pricing as appropriate at the market level or at the restaurant level. Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 3.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year. But as expected, it was 130 basis point sequential increase from Q3 to support Carne Asada and the latest brand messaging under our Behind the Foil campaign. We expect marketing spend to be near 4% in Q1, which would be the highest quarterly level during 2021 in order to support new menu items as well as the upcoming Super Bowl ad. As a result of the higher anticipated marketing demand and ongoing momentum in our delivery business, we expect other operating costs to be right around 17% in Q1. The Q4 restaurant-level margin was 19.5%, while our trailing 12-month average unit volumes were roughly $2.2 million, which is back to our pre-COVID level. We expect to close much of this margin gap versus the 22% expected at this volume in 2021 as COVID-related impacts and delivery economics normalize and as quarterly marketing expenses even out. Note that, some of this gap relates to delivery accounting as increased delivery menu prices as well as delivery and service fees had the effect of grossing up which may create the appearance that margin algorithm gap is widening. Therefore, we now disclose our AUVs with and without the delivery menu price increase to provide better clarity and transparency. G&A for the quarter was $124 million on a GAAP basis or $114 million on a non-GAAP basis excluding roughly $7 million for settlement of several older legal matters and nearly $3 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also includes $90 million in underlying G&A $21 million related to non-cash stock comp, and a $4 million bonus performance adjustment due to our strong performance in 2020 despite the pandemic. We are still in the early innings of our growth life cycle and therefore continue to make important G&A investments in 2020 despite the COVID pandemic. We saw an uptick in Q4 underlying G&A due to technology investments, customer service enhancements, increased headcount as well as higher medical claims. Looking ahead to Q1, we expect underlying G&A expense to carry forward in the $90 million range as we continue to make tech investments the majority of which are revenue-generating to bolster our expanding digital and loyalty platform. These include initiatives that are customer-facing like app upgrades as well as behind-the-scenes initiatives like a new labor scheduling tool. In addition, we also plan to increase headcount in order to support our expected accelerated growth. Even with this elevated spend our goal remains to deliver leverage on this line item relative to our sales growth. Stock comp will likely be around $23 million each quarter in 2021 although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance. We also expect to recognize around $4 million of employer taxes in Q1 associated with shares that vest at the beginning of our fiscal year. Lastly, our 2018 performance shares were modified to account for unplanned effects of COVID. This will result in a GAAP accounting charge of about $24 million for both Q1 and Q2, and about $8 million in Q3 and Q4. We plan to present non-GAAP results without these unusual charges to clearly show our underlying business performance. Our effective tax rate for Q4 was negative 62.2% on a GAAP basis and 24.6% on a non-GAAP basis. The difference is due to recognizing a net operating loss for tax purposes in 2020, which we expect to carry back to the preceding five years. We generated an NOL for tax purposes due to several factors, including the impact of COVID increased tax deduction for equity, vesting and exercises accelerated tax depreciation deductions and various tax planning initiatives. An income tax benefit is generated due to the difference in federal tax rates between 2020 and the years that the federal NOL will be carried back to. For fiscal 2021, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate to be in the 25% to 27% range though it may vary based on discrete items, such as stock option exercises. This range assumes no change to current income tax rate. And if corporate tax rates change, as a result of tax reform under the Biden administration, we'll revisit our estimated effective tax rate. Turning now to the balance sheet, where we ended Q4 with $1.1 billion in cash restricted cash and investments and no debt along with a $600 million untapped credit facility. We're privileged to have this financial strength with which to make ongoing strategic investments in our people, our business, and our communities to further differentiate Chipotle brand and support our expected growth for 2021 and beyond. We didn't buy back any stock in Q4, but if our business continues to improve and economy continues to stabilize we will likely begin buying again in late Q1 or early Q2. One area that definitely benefited from our strong cash position is restaurant design and real state development, where we remain diligent and aggressive while many of our peers pulled back. I'm really impressed by the hard work of our development and operations team as they opened 61 new restaurants in the fourth quarter with 42 including a Chipotlane. For the full year, they successfully navigated construction and permitting challenges and opened 161 new restaurants with 100, including a Chipotlane. Remarkably, this was towards the high end of the 150 to 165 range we provided before the onset of the pandemic. As of year-end, we had a total of 170 Chipotlanes, including five conversions. Performance for these formats continues to be stellar. The digital gap versus non-Chipotlane restaurants remains around 10% driven entirely by higher-margin digital pickup orders. And sales at the Chipotlane cohort continued to outperform the non-Chipotlane results from the same open period. In fact non-comp Chipotlane sales are opening close to our existing restaurant AUV versus historical peak productivity in the mid to high 80% range. These results reaffirm our strategy of an accelerated pivot towards Chipotlane sites. Not only will this enhance customer access and convenience but it also helps increase new restaurant sales, margins, and returns. While 62% of new restaurants in 2020 had a Chipotlane, our goal is to have more than 70% of openings include a Chipotlane in 2021 where we anticipate opening around 200 new restaurants. Of course this development guidance assumes no major COVID related delays in 2021. Guidance also includes remodeling or relocating 10 to 15 restaurants this year to add a Chipotlane. This will allow us to learn and ensure we're getting a superior return on this investment before potentially ramping up the number of remodels and our relocations in the future. Let me end by also expressing my gratitude to all of our team members in our restaurants and in support roles as they overcame countless challenges and embraced change to safely serve and delight our guests. It's through this collaborative effort that we've been able to achieve such an impressive performance in 2020 and continue to build momentum at the start of this year. With that we're happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Nicole Miller : Thank you, and congratulations on a great year despite all the challenges. I wanted to just talk about the go-forward estimates and opportunity around unit growth. If you remove the barriers to development that are COVID related and certainly there's no financial hurdles from a cash perspective, how fast can your current team go with a fully formed bench? Just essentially what are stretch goals that you look at internally? Brian Niccol : Yeah. Thanks Nicole. Look, I think what we're really excited about is we definitely see the opportunity to getting back above 200 restaurants, and the good news is part of the reason why we're accelerating is because our operations are running so well, and we know we've got the people bench to run those restaurants. We'll continue to look for great sites. The good news is we have a lot of inbound desire for Chipotle coming from a lot of different places and we know we still have lots of places to build. So, we're very optimistic about how we can accelerate from where we finished this year at 161 to getting to 200 and beyond. So, Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything to that? Jack Hartung : No Brian. I think you said it well. Our -- Nicole, our record for a year was right around 250. We certainly can get up to that point. I don't know if it will take us a couple of years or not, but I think the sites are coming to us. As Brian mentioned, we've got the deep bench now, but we're going to do it a step at a time. We're going to go from 161 to something around this 200 level, but we certainly can go beyond that. Nicole Miller : And the cauliflower rice is outstanding. I've tried it in multiple channels. When I go into the restaurant, it's a $2 upcharge. When I order through the marketplace it's a $2.25 upcharge. Is that how you're getting the pricing power? Can you just establish for us today that you're not taking your 13% across the board right? There's a strategic I imagine algorithm that helps produce that pricing power. Brian Niccol : Yeah. That's exactly right Nicole. We're basically testing a lot of different pricing levers, but we are very strategic in where we choose to implement that pricing, and you're right, the only place that we've taken that 13% is in the delivery channel. And effectively it plays out the way you just described it like on a cauliflower rice add-on or to your total ticket depending on what you're ordering. So -- but it's an ongoing process, it's a fluid process and we're not done working on it. Nicole Miller : Thank you. Appreciate it. Brian Niccol : Sure. Operator : And our next question will come from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. I actually had three little small questions. One, you mentioned in the release that delivery added a point or so to comp in that quarter. Does that -- was that for the entire quarter or will that be a bigger tailwind in the first quarter and beyond? I didn't catch that. Forgive me if you said that. And then Jack, just the restaurant level margins you touched on that as well about how the $19.5 million or so was short of that relationship that you would have for a $2.2 million box, i.e. that should be 22% if you get your delivery economics up to speed. Should we be thinking about -- what is the buildup that -- in that margin through the year? How fast can you close that gap in that relationship? And I guess the last thing is when it comes to the two-year trend in comp basically if you look at The Street numbers, people are thinking a mid-teens two-year or thereabout after we get vaccines. And I'm wondering how you -- I know you're not giving guidance, but how do you think about the net of people having more options but yet you're having perhaps a better daytime traffic and walk-in traffic than you would. Sorry for the three questions. Brian Niccol : Hey, Jack, you want to take the delivery and margin and then I can touch on the last piece? Jack Hartung : Yes. Sure thing Brian. I'll start with the margin because I might David ask you for a little clarity on the delivery comp question. But on the margin you heard it right. Right now, we're being bogged down by some of the COVID-related expenses. There's also delivery and that being a drag right now, but we can see as COVID-19 begins to be in a rearview mirror and as we have taken some action and we consider other action and how we're going to offset the margin impact of delivery, I would expect by the end of the year. And remember COVID is going to be with us for at least a quarter or two. I mean the vaccine is not going to be widely available until more like midyear. So, it's going to be more second half of the year, but I feel good about by the second half of the year that we should be closing the gap. If not all the way, we'll be knocking on the door on what the margin algorithm would be. And then David, maybe you can clarify parts about delivery comp. David Palmer : Yes. And maybe I'm misunderstanding this, but I think you talked about a 13% increase -- or 13% higher prices for your delivery menu. Jack Hartung : Right. David Palmer : And you said a point -- I think it was in the release that it was about 100 [ph] basis point help to your comp in the quarter. Maybe that was because it was only there for part of the quarter because I would imagine that if delivery was about a quarter of your business I'm just trying to understand if that could be -- if delivery pricing could be a bigger lift in the coming quarters. That's basically what I'm getting at there. Jack Hartung : Yes. So, here let me say what delivery actually did drive in the quarter. The 13% because delivery is about 25% that ends up being an effect of like 3.25% like call it 3% 3.25% price increase. That's the impact in the quarter. And the price increase we had two, we had one in August one in early October. So, we had a full effect during the quarter. So, that's more of the impact that we had during the quarter. David Palmer : Got it. Okay. Thanks. Brian Niccol : And then David just in regard to your question about our -- I think it's really our confidence in where the business goes from here is kind of what you're getting at which is look I think the thing that I'm really optimistic about is we have really grown a meaningful digital business that's got access for just about every occasion you can think of. And currently we're even testing now a car-side access. What I've seen is in the markets where we start to open those dining rooms up, you don't lose those occasions. You pick up the occasions that kind of got impacted by COVID. And it really is an and situation not an or. Now, it's not 100% back in the dining room in some of these regions. But we're seeing 50%, 60% of the dining room business come back and we're hanging on to 85%, 80% of our digital business. And as you walk into 2021, our digital system now has 19.5 million members. And what we have seen is they like the additional access, the convenience that it provides. And they like our ability to communicate with them through that rewards program. And so look I think January is a great example of the strength of Chipotle's business still being impacted by COVID rolling over a year ago that didn't have COVID. And I think it just shows the power of the new access points, the way we're running our restaurants, the culture that we have in our restaurants. And then ultimately our customers believe in the food believe in the purpose. So, very optimistic about where we get to. And as Jack pointed out, I think as the year goes on you're going to continue to see us make progress on getting that algorithm back to where we said it will get to as COVID wanes and some of these expenses go away. And the delivery channel we kind of normalize it into our business going forward. David Palmer : Great. Thank you. Brian Niccol : Yes. Operator : And our next question will come from Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Chris Carril : Hi, thanks for taking the question. So, I think last quarter you quantified about 100 basis points of direct and indirect margin drag from COVID-related costs. Can you provide an update on how these costs impacted the margins in the 4Q? And then any thoughts on how we should think about these costs over the course of the year? That would be really helpful. Brian Niccol : Why don't you take that one Jack? Jack Hartung : Yes Chris. Yes they're still in that ballpark. There's direct and indirect. Like for example we had -- pay during the quarter. So, that's where our employees have been or may have been exposed. And so they don't work. We don't want them at the restaurant but we pay them anyway. That all by itself was 50 basis points. There's indirect items as well. Like for example we're selling less beverages. We're selling like a few more burritos and more steaks. That seems a little counterintuitive why would COVID drive that, but we have a lot of new customers coming in and they've been moving into those items. Unclear whether that will fully normalize after the pandemic. But I would say with the direct and indirect that we know about that comp delivery, it probably stays at 50 to 100 basis points range. And then delivery all by itself [Technical Difficulty] Brian Niccol : Jack, we're losing you. I don't know if your microphone-- Jack Hartung : Sorry about that. Okay. I'll take it off speaker. Can you hear me a little better now? Brian Niccol : Yeah. That's a lot better. You were kind of \u2013 you said roughly, the same and then you started to trail off. Jack Hartung : Yeah. So it's \u2013 I would call it in that of the direct impact, it's going to be in that 50 to 100 basis point impact. And that counts things like the exclusion pay which is very direct and then product mix shifts and then does not count delivery. Delivery all by itself is going to be a pricer in this. You probably call it the 60 to 80 or 90 basis point impact. But I think the key to all of this is, we believe as COVID is starting to move into the rearview mirror as we're starting to move out of it, and combined with actions that we will take to either offset some of these costs or find other efficiencies we do think we can capture all this margin. Chris Carril : Okay. Great. Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : And our next question will come from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hey, good afternoon. Brian, I want to come back to this question on the interplay between the delivery channel and your in-restaurant business. And I wanted to get a gauge for what you think is possible in terms of the in-restaurant transactions returning? And I think you said, you're recapturing 50% to 60%. And I think maybe 60% of your dining rooms are still closed. So I guess, what do you think the upside is on the in-restaurant business coming back? And how much of the digital channel do you think has replaced those in-restaurant transactions I guess said differently. So? Brian Niccol : Yeah. Sure. What I would say David is, we're still seeing like that lunch occasion have a real opportunity. And what we've seen is in places where you have people moving around more for whatever their routine is, you see that occasion still happening, where they want to come into the restaurant. And look, I still think, the occasion of the dining room experience gives you something unique. It's got another level of customization, because you get to be face-to-face with how we're making your food versus the online occasion. And so when we talk to customers, there is a fair amount of people that when they have the opportunity, they will want to go back to their dining occasion. The thing that I find really promising in that is, they've also adopted new off-premise digital occasions that they're not going to abandon. And when we look at the Venn diagram, the world where it used to be they were exclusive. I only did online, and I only do in dining and there was a few that did both. That's changed. You've got a lot more people doing both. And we've got people that historically probably would not have tried it, if not for unfortunately COVID. But they still really love that in-restaurant experience and now we're top of mind for that occasion when they're not going to be in the restaurant. So we're seeing a scenario where digital is going to prove to be very sticky and people look forward to getting back out and going into our restaurants. David Tarantino : Great. And then, I guess, the second question is you mentioned something about with your digital marketing efforts or your loyalty program making it a priority that some of those digital customers stick. Can you just elaborate on what you're doing there? Brian Niccol : Yeah. Sure. So this is what I mentioned. We've got 19.5 million folks in this. And the team has really done a terrific job of setting up I think the right cohorts, understanding the frequency of how they need to communicate with those cohorts, and then drive home the idea of engagement and/or driving home frequency or purchasing behaviors. And we've got various journeys taking place. I mentioned it in my prepared remarks. And what we're seeing is it does have a powerful impact on people's frequency. And the good news is we believe we're learning more every day. But what we've learned to date, I think is going to have a powerful tailwind for us going forward. And if you think about 2020, we started the year with I think it was less than 10 million in our system. So you've got twice the amount of people that we can influence behavior with on a pretty one-to-one basis. So that's why you hear me talking about why I see this being a driver going forward. David Tarantino : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John Glass : Hi. Thanks so much. First, just to follow up on the delivery costs. Jack, you said the 60 to 80 basis points of pressure or 69 \u2013 90 whatever it was. Is that inclusive? Is that after you've taken this price increase, or was that prior? And is there \u2013 when you think about offsetting it is there a way to offset it fully? Are you thinking about you can recapture the margin elsewhere and delivery will always be of some dilution to margin but you just get it somewhere else, or is there a way you think within delivery specifically that you can fully offset that \u2013 those delivery cost outcomes? Jack Hartung : Yeah, John, here let me kind of walk through the pieces. The price increase that we took it covers the dollar cost of delivery like there's an increase in delivery this year versus last year, because so many people moved into that channel. And so the price increase we took so far it gets us to about a breakeven versus last year in terms of a dollar \u2013 from a dollar standpoint. But if you go through the math, and it's easiest to do this like on an annual basis, if you \u2013 this 13% on 25% of the business ends up being about $80,000. And so look at the average cost of delivery being about $80,000 on average per restaurant. When you take that price increase, it ends up being a 3%, 3.25%, your sales will go up by about $80,000. And so you cover those dollars, your cash flow on a per restaurant basis are the same. But if you go through the math and take the same cash flow and take 25%, which ends up being $625,000 of cash flow, that's $2.5 million at a 25% margin. And if your costs go up $80,000 and your revenue goes up by $80,000, your margin is going to go down by 80 basis points. And so we don't make any less money, but the margin does end up being diluted just because of the math. Now we think there are things that we can do either levers, we can pull other efficiencies we can file. We think over time we can offset that, but that's just a math challenge that we're dealing with. John Glass : That's helpful. And then Brian maybe just bigger picture now. You've got some more Chipotlanes under your belt. You're looking at maybe it's just early days, but a digital-only restaurant. When is the time to reexamine kind of the total opportunity of units in the US? And you haven't -- we haven't spoken about international in a long, long time. I think, France was thrown into one of the comments. Is it a moment now where you start to really think about a global opportunity and start to talk and engage with either master franchisees or your own organization how you do that, or is that still too far in the future and you've got too much on your plate right now to really engage in that? Brian Niccol : Yes. Sure. So look the first part of your question around the opportunity in the US is, we're very optimistic about Chipotlane and then the various executions we can pull off to bring Chipotle to every trade area in the United States that we think makes sense for Chipotle. And I think we've talked about that as hey, we're accelerating, we're going to get back above 200. We're within striking distance of where the max level of development we did in the past. And so the economics look great. The new restaurant openings are opening really strong. Chipotlane continues to perform. And you see us experimenting with digital only. You'll see us experimenting with Chipotlanes only. But at the end of the day, I mean, the full business of Chipotle where you got both lines, a Chipotlane as an access point with this digital system, it's just really winning economics and there are a lot of those sites available in the US. To your question about international, obviously, we believe Chipotle can travel beyond the United States. We're already seeing some success in Canada. And then, obviously, we've got some plans in place for places that we already have our foot in the door. So think of the UK, France specifically. And so you're going to see us starting to really use kind of our stage-gate process to move those markets along. And then we'll evaluate other regions accordingly. We've not made decisions on how we want to enter those other markets. And frankly, we haven't laid out exactly the order of how we're going to do it. For now, we want to deliver the US. And where we already have some presence, we're going to start leaning into to see how much more upside there is. We have an idea. And then, obviously, we're going to evaluate where we go beyond the markets that we currently are. But when we've done some research, what is clear is people love the purpose of Food with Integrity. They love the customization. They love the food. And frankly the whole value proposition, I think has legs well beyond the United States. John Glass : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jared Garber : Hi. Thank you very much for taking the question. It's really great to see the results this year. I wanted to ask Brian quickly on the marketing side. One of your goals when you joined the company was to boost the visibility of the brand and you talked about that at top of the call. So you'll be running the Super Bowl ad this year, which is the first for the company. Can you talk about the brand's visibility now and where it stands versus maybe several years ago when you took over? And how you're thinking about continued opportunities going forward? And I have a quick follow-up on the carne -- rather the cauliflower rice, and if you're seeing new customers joining the brand. Obviously, it's only been a couple of weeks, but if you're seeing new customers visit on the back of that? Thanks. Brian Niccol : Yes. Sure. Thanks Jared and welcome. So look, first of all, I just believe our message is a strong message that differentiates our brand and it's a message that's very much on trend with how young people want to eat and the future of how people want to eat. So you're going to see us continue to push the visibility of Chipotle and the idea of real food, with real cooking, real culinary done frankly every day. And what I can tell you is, when I rewind the tapes, when I first got here back in 2018, we were arguably spending about the same percent of dollars and nobody saw the brand. If I would have asked you, what's Chipotle up to? You would not have been able to give me a good answer. Frankly, it would have been somebody else's narrative. And I think fast forward to where we are today. I know our brand is stronger from an awareness standpoint for what we stand for. I know the brand is stronger from a trust standpoint. I know the brand is stronger, when it comes to our menu innovation, as well as our approach to culinary. So we've made tremendous progress. The marketing team I think has done a fabulous job of keeping the brand in culture and leading culture. And you're going to continue to see us do that. I'm excited about bringing our message to the Super Bowl platform. I think it's going to be a very widely watched Super Bowl. And a lot of customers say to us, I feel good about eating at Chipotle, but they can't articulate why. We're going to tell them why they feel good about it. Obviously, they love the culinary aspect. But now they're going to get clarity on why they feel good about, why they choose the brand Chipotle. And you'll see it in the advertising around our approach to farming, animals, sustainability and frankly the communities that we support and operate in. And then your second question about cauliflower rice. Look, I love it. It's really good. I highly recommend it, if you haven't tried it. I'd recommend going 50-50, a little brown rice and cauliflower rice. But with that said, the good news is about 25% of our orders are coming from new or infrequent customers, which is really terrific. So it's off to a great start and our operators are doing a great job of making the cauliflower absolutely perfect. So we're really happy with how that's come out of the gate. Operator : And our next question will come from Andrew Charles with Cowen. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles : Great. Thanks. I had two questions : one on quesadilla and one on catering. So Brian you mentioned that the national launch of quesadillas are in the near feature, but it doesn't look like it's contemplated in 1Q same-store sales guidance given it implies a deceleration to your trends from January to the combined February and March time frame. Does guidance reflect uncertainty over the course of the pandemic or more so conservatism as quesadillas are expected to launch later in the quarter? And then my second question on catering. As we look towards the reopening, how big of an emphasis do you plan to place on catering given the gap you guys historically had with 1% of your sales coming from catering before the pandemic versus fast casual peers that were typically in that 8% range? Brian Niccol : So to answer your first question look, I think there's still \u2013 as much as I'm optimistic that the vaccine program is getting better as every day goes by and it really is amazing to see the efficacy of these vaccines. There still is \u2013 we want to be cautious about where COVID goes from here. So we're being careful on that front. And then obviously, as we are able to lock and load on new initiatives, we'll share that with you guys. We're still in the phase of making sure we've got the equipment rolled out everywhere. And we're feeling really good about the training, we're going to do around quesadilla. So more to come on that front. But I would say more of it is just there's still a lot of unknown. Luckily every day seems to be better with this \u2013 with the whole COVID issue both \u2013 vaccine rates seem to be going up and COVID cases seem to be going down. And luckily less and less people are ending up in the hospital. So I'm optimistic but we wanted to be conservative on that front. And then regarding catering, yes, look Andrew, I think it's a huge opportunity. Once people want to get back together I think it's going to be a real big opportunity for our business. And it's one of the areas we're thinking about. And we're going to figure out the right time to start pushing that once obviously people can get back together in groups in a meaningful way. So it's a big opportunity. I wish we \u2013 the first step will be getting back to 1% of our sales doing catering. And then the next step will be tracking down numbers that I think are much higher than where we were with 1%. Andrew Charles : Thanks helpful. Thanks, Brian. Brian Niccol : Yes. Operator : And our next question will come from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you. As usual you kind of gave the metrics, which we could interpret. Revenue at over 6,000 stores, average volumes at least 2.5 million, at least 25% store margins. But the G&A number would be obviously a really important part to kind of having a sense of what run rate operating income might be at the company. Brian are you thinking in any way of kind of thinking about an appropriate at that level G&A per store, G&A as kind of a percentage of sales that as you think about longer-term revenue goals and longer-term operating income goals that we could perhaps start to anchor around? And I do ask that somewhat in the context of what you put in your press release and I'm sorry if I missed it in the previous press release or forgot about it, reducing non-essential \u2013 focusing on reducing non-essential controllable costs. If you could elaborate on that and kind of how much focus that I guess phrase is receiving within the organization. Thanks. Brian Niccol : Yes. Sure. Look, I will tell you, I don't know if you've had the opportunity to meet Scott Boatwright. He's in charge of our operations. And Scott and all of our leaders in operations, their goal is to give people a great culinary experience and also give our team members a great culture and the opportunity to grow in our organization and do it in a way where we flow the revenue to the bottom line. So wherever we see an opportunity to get rid of unnecessary costs or frankly labor allocation, we go after it and we'll continue to go after it. And that's why I've got a high level of confidence \u2013 a very high level of confidence that the algorithm is going to be intact as we move throughout the year. Because as we continue to regain sales, we do things with our labor scheduling technology. And frankly our operators are laser-focused on giving people great experiences and then flowing to the bottom line accordingly. Of course, it's something we keep an eye on. So I don't think it's necessary to pick a certain point because there's always going to be opportunities where, if we see an investment that makes sense to grow our business we're going to make that investment. There's just way too much growth in this company to constrain us that way. So Jack I don't know if you've got anything else to add to that. Jack Hartung : Brian the only thing I would add \u2013 we expect to grow sales at a faster rate than our G&A. And so we did step up. We made some investments this year that will set kind of a new baseline for us for this next year. But you can expect to see leverage in that line. In terms of where it's going to be 2, 3, 4 years from now that's -- don't have that great of a crystal ball. But if we make sure that sales grow faster than that line then three or four years from now the percentage of sales and the margin after G&A -- the operating margin is going to be better -- much better than it is today as we approach the 25% target on the restaurant level and we lever this line. John Ivankoe : Thanks guys. Operator : And our next question will come from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Please go ahead. Chris O'Cull: Thanks, good afternoon guys. Jack I was curious if you could frame up where the beverage mix is today versus pre-pandemic. And then Brian looking ahead to periods where consumer behavior normalizes is there an opportunity to relaunch the Tractor Beverage program to build awareness once consumers are kind of back in the dining rooms more consistently? And then I had a follow-up. Jack Hartung : Yes just quickly... Brian Niccol : Go ahead Jack. Go ahead. Jack Hartung : I was just going to say real quickly just on the mix before the pandemic our drinks were in call it the mid-30% range of transactions. And that dropped more like in the mid-20% range. So it cut out about 1/3 of our beverages. Our beverages also lean more towards bottled drinks now with the Tractor Beverage. Tractor Beverage is a -- and Brian is going to talk about it but is more in line with our food ethos. And those have a lower margin as well. So those are the two things that have been a drag on our margins. Brian Niccol : Yes. And look we absolutely believe there's an opportunity to reintroduce Tractor Beverage once folks come back in the dining rooms. And look the good news is the feedback from those that have tried it they really liked it. Chris O'Cull: That's good. And then just assuming smoked brisket can clear the remaining operational hurdles, does the offering have the opportunity to be rolled out as a permanent offering, or are there supply constraints similar to carne asada? Brian Niccol : Yes. No smoked brisket will be one of our -- I would call it seasonal specials. It doesn't -- it won't be a permanent item. Chris O'Cull: Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : And our next question will come from Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Brian Vaccaro : Thanks and good evening. Just a clarification and then a question, if I could. Jack I appreciate the monthly comp commentary. I was hoping maybe we could convert that into absolute sales volumes. And it seems that average weekly sales have stepped up more recently maybe into that 47-a-week range. Is that correct? And then does your Q1 comp guide in the mid- to high-teens does that assume any change in that absolute sales volume later through the quarter? Jack Hartung : Yes. We don't really look at it internally that way on a weekly volume, but the volumes definitely stepped up. And if you looked at the weekly volumes, we all saw that COVID really came on pretty strong in December. We did see our sales bounce around. So even though our monthly comps were pretty even we softened at the end of November. Right before Christmas we started to pick up a little bit. We surged after Christmas and then surged again in January. So we're definitely at a higher level right now. And in terms of the guidance Brian mentioned before the first quarter is still difficult to predict. We don't know where COVID is going next. We're optimistic because the vaccines are getting traction. But it essentially takes the last week trend which we talked about in the script. We -- while we did overall 11% for January we had moved down into the high single digits at the last week of January. If you take that trend and move that out over the rest of the quarter that's what we use to calculate that guidance of mid- to high-teens. Brian Vaccaro : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then my question is on the loyalty program. And I understand you're up to nearly 20 million members. But could you comment on how engagement with the program has been trending? Maybe you could give us a sense of how many active users you have and maybe how you define that or perhaps a comment on the percent of sales that are generated within the loyalty program in recent months. Brian Niccol : Yes sure. So I would say the way we look at it is, it's roughly about 60% are active. And those are the folks that obviously we've got an ongoing program with. We also have programs though with folks that we see that aren't active right to get them to reengage. So we're accessing the full database as well as other platforms on top of it. So it goes well beyond that 20 million. But like I mentioned earlier we're seeing really good results in our ability to interact with those that are active and then we're able to also get people to be reactive -- or reactivated I guess is the way to think about it. So it's one of those things that we're very excited about because we continue to learn. And so when we see somebody that is no longer active we learn from it and then we figure out how to reengage them. And then we're having some success in keeping a percentage of those people then becoming active as we continue to grow the total universe. So -- and the good news is we're also modifying the program as we go forward. We're going to continue to keep people excited. And we get feedback on how we can make it better and we'll continue to do that. Brian Vaccaro : All right. Thank you. Operator : And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Brian for any closing remarks. Brian Niccol : Yes. Thank you and thanks everybody for taking the time and asking the questions. I'm just going to reiterate what I really said at the beginning of the call which is really proud of our team members the work that's happened in our restaurants and our support centers through a very challenging year. I think it just demonstrates our purpose, our values, our culture and the caliber of the people that we have at Chipotle. It really demonstrates the resiliency of the brand and the leaders that we have. And very proud of where we are. And obviously I'm very optimistic about where we're going. The digital system is strong it's growing and we have plans to continue to grow it. Our in-store business when it can come back I know people will want to come back because the culinary and the food is second to none. And you just put those two things together with the ability to continue to build more restaurants hire more people and grow our people accordingly I think the future is very bright. And I'm optimistic that COVID is hopefully more in the rearview mirror going forward. So thank you for taking the time. Hopefully all of you are safe and your families have weathered 2020 well. And I look forward to continuing to share the story in 2021. All the best. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, Head of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead. Ashish Kohli : Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. By now you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations Web site at ir.chipotle.com. I'll begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the Presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our Web site. We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian. Brian Niccol : Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. Chipotle is off to a promising start in 2021 which gives me optimism for the rest of the year. There's still uncertainty related to COVID, but as more people become vaccinated, including many Chipotle employees, I'm hopeful we're getting closer to brighter days ahead. In fact, all but about 20 of our restaurants are now open with 92% of them offering in-restaurant dining with capacity limitations. For the quarter, we reported sales of $1.7 billion, representing 23.4% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by 17.2% comparable restaurant sales growth, including about a 1.5% headwind from winter weather in February; restaurant level margins of 22.3%, which is 470 basis points higher than last year; earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $5.36, representing an increase of 74% year-over-year; digital sales growth of 133.9% year-over-year, representing 50.1% of sales and opened 40 new restaurants, including 26 with the Chipotlane. Not surprisingly, comparable restaurant sales were the highest during the month of March as we lacked easier comparisons. And I'm pleased to report that April is off to a good start. These results highlight that our key strategies continue to resonate with guests and position us to win today, while we create the future. Let me now provide a brief update on each of these strategies, which I believe will help fulfill our long-term vision of more than 6,000 restaurants, AUVs above $2.5 million and restaurant level margins above 25%. These are, one, making the brand visible, relevant and loved; two, utilizing a disciplined approach to creativity and innovation; three, leveraging digital capabilities to drive productivity and expand access, convenience and engagement; four, engaging with customers through our loyalty program; and five, running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides delicious food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences. Let me start with our marketing efforts, where the team is doing a great job being agile and remaining relevant to a consumer mindset that continues to evolve. Internally, we encourage curiosity and experimentation, which takes advantage of our digital and social capabilities in conjunction with TV advertising to consistently reinforce our messaging. For example, we leveraged the return of sports to showcase our brand and purpose. Our first ever Super Bowl commercial titled, Can a Burrito Change the World, was very successful at highlighting Chipotle's dedication to cultivating a better world through real food, sustainable sourcing and a commitment of the farming industry. We also connected and engaged with our guest during March Madness with a mouth watering commercial showcasing real ingredients, real cooking and real people in order to support the launch of our hand-crafted quesadillas. Not to be outdone, our digital communication strategy involves supercharging the superfans who are true advocates. Content on social platforms is a key way we interact with our guests. The angle for all of our creative initiatives is to drive culture, drive a difference and ultimately drive a purchase. Helping these marketing efforts were a handful of new menu innovations, which provide wonderful examples of the stage-gate process and our team's ability to execute new food experiences. Cauliflower rice, which we launched in early January and will continue through mid-May, is continuing to bring in new guests. In addition, we launched quesadillas across the U.S. and Canada as a digital exclusive offering on March 11. This is our first new customizable entree in 17 years and was the most requested item by guests not on our existing menu. We made sure we took the proper time to develop an excellent product that consumers love and also works well operationally. The end result is a quesadilla that is perfectly crispy on the outside with delicious melted cheese on the inside. My personal favorite is the barbacoa quesadilla. The benefits of a digital-only offering are that it leverages our digital scale while removing operational friction by utilizing our digital kitchen. Although it's only been out for about a month, we're encouraged by its performance thus far with an incidence mix of approximately 10% and expected to remain a guest favorite moving forward. Last but certainly not least, we also had Carne Asada for the majority of the quarter and we're pleased to say that it had an incidence mix similar to what we saw last year. And our talented culinary team has not done innovating. We have several market tests of new items scheduled later this year that have shown promise in early-stage consumer testing. We're gaining valuable feedback and we'll update you on their progress as they move through our stage-gate process. Also, it's likely that we will put another marketing push behind some 2020 initiatives like tractor beverages, later this year to optimize their performance once COVID normalizes Let me now talk about the next strategic driver, our digital platform. Our investments in new digital features and innovations helped Q1 digital sales grow 134% year-over-year to $870 million and represent 50% of sales. Momentum continued to build within the quarter with March setting a new record for digital transactions supported by our best ever digital order ahead month, over 800,000 app downloads and the most new digital customer since May of 2020. With the overall digital mix remaining relatively stable for the last three quarters, we\u2019re delighted to see that our highest margin transaction, digital pickup orders were slightly more than half of digital sales during Q1. Within the delivery channel, about 40% were initiated through the Chipotle app or website, while the remainder were through a handful of partners. Our digital sales are a sticky, frictionless and convenient experience as evidenced by our April digital sales mix holding around 50%. Aided by the quesadilla launch, our digital sales are now slightly above the COVID peak from last year. While we've recovered roughly 60% of in-restaurant sales as dining rooms have reopened. We also continued to see outside digital performance in Chipotlanes, which have revolutionized the drive-thru experience towards order ahead for pickup transactions, which is our most profitable channel. As our digital ecosystem has evolved from a commerce system to a platform of engagement, we continue to look for ways to enhance convenience and access, including Chipotlanes, alternative store formats, digital-only menu offerings and Chipotle rewards. We are regularly making enhancements to our app, website, delivering group offerings to support the current and expected future growth within this channel. We'll also continue to make important tech investments to create a path for the future. One such example is our recent investment in Europe, an early-stage leader in autonomous delivery. Nuro uses robotics in their fleet of on-road, occupantless and autonomous vehicles to deliver everyday consumer goods and we believe has the potential to take the delivery experience to the next level. Speaking of our loyalty program, we now have more than 21 million passionate members that receive targeted and personalized messages. We are leveraging the CRM platform for purpose-driven messaging, as well as tempting fans with our latest promotions. Communications to our customers are individually tailored, so that specific customer activities prompt targeted responses. Each digital message can vary along the customer buying journey, such as the latest promotional offer and a new menu item, or a more targeted offer to entice a customer that has not visited a restaurant for a certain period of time. For example, customers received communication about the quesadilla launch featuring their favorite protein based on their ordering history. Our loyalty program has been very successful in driving additional transactions across our light, medium and heavy consumer segments. But we continue to increase the level of sophistication and experience in our information and targeting, which should bode well for the future of Chipotle rewards. We're also investing in talent and infrastructure for rewards and have several enhancements to the program planned for later this year that consumers have indicated would increase their engagement and purchases. Let me end by talking about the foundational ingredient of our success. And that's our restaurant operations, where the team has done a great job staying focused on safety, reliability and excellent culinary. Running great restaurants requires great people and Chipotle is privileged to have amazing employees. Our continued investment in our team members to ensure they have the resources to develop and thrive in their career, including the recently announced expansion of debt-free degrees in agriculture, culinary, hospitality and supply chain is paying off. Turnover continues to be relatively stable and we are seeing great applicants for open positions to staff our expected growth in AUV and new restaurant openings. After visiting a number of our restaurants recently, I'm encouraged to see more guests enjoying their food in our dining rooms. As a result, we've been reiterating the importance of executing great throughput by teaching, training and validating the five pillars of throughput every day during every shift. After all, guests need to feel safe and deserve a great and fast in-restaurant experience. Chipotle is a unique brand committed to fostering a culture that values and champions our diversity, while leveraging the individual talents of all team members to grow our business and cultivate a better world. To show how passionate we are about inspiring real change in people, food and the environment. We have tied 10% of officers' annual incentive bonus to the company achieving certain ESG goals. Our updated sustainability report, which was published last week showcases our desire for transparency and being a leader in sustainability. I also want to take this opportunity to welcome our two new independent directors, Matt Carey and Mauricio Gutierrez both bring excellent experience to our board and will be valuable assets for Chipotle. Finally, I want to thank our employees for their incredible level of collaboration and tireless dedication, which were critical in helping demonstrate the brand's resiliency. While the past year has been full of ups and downs and the volatility related to COVID may not be fully behind us, I believe Chipotle is stronger today and is well positioned for growth. As a result, I'm excited about our future as we remain a premier fast casual brand, focusing on all stakeholders, a leader in culinary, a leader in food with integrity and an innovator providing convenient access inside our restaurants as well as through our expanding digital ecosystem. With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials. Jack Hartung : Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We're proud of our performance during the first quarter with sales growing 23.4% year-over-year to $1.7 billion as comp sales grew 17.2%; restaurant level margin of 22.3% was 470 basis points higher than last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $5.36, representing a 74% year-over-year increase. This included benefit from lower taxes related to option exercises and share vesting, which is more than offset by higher G&A related to performance based catch up adjustment and taxes on equity exercising investments. And I'll discuss these factors in greater detail shortly. The first quarter had unusual expenses related to our 2018 performance year modification to account for the unplanned effects of COVID, restaurant asset impairments and closure costs as well as transformation costs, which negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.91, leading to a GAAP earnings per share of $4.45. While, the impact from COVID appears to be lessening, we're not quite out of the woods yet as seen by the recent spikes in a few regions as well as a pause in administering certain vaccines and therefore it's still difficult to provide comp guidance for full year 2021. We are encouraged by the strong start and we're optimistic about our full year performance in 2021. The geometric two year stack for Q1 comp is about 21% due to dining rooms reopening, our cauliflower rice launch, effective marketing, continued digital performance and the introduction of quesadilla which all helped drive a strong finish to the quarter. For Q2, we expect our comp to be in the range of the high 20% to 30% with quesadilla incidents normalizing and a lower marketing investment. Food costs are 30% in Q1, a decrease of 280 basis points from last year that's due to primarily to menu price increases, a mix shift toward higher margin protein and lower waste, which were partially offset by costs associated with cauliflower rice and fewer sales of high margin beverages. In Q2, expect food costs to be in the mid to high 30% range, but the benefit from our delivery menu price increase will be more than offset by seasonally higher avocado prices. Labor costs for the quarter were 24.9%, a decrease of 300 basis points from last year, this decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage and efficiencies related to digital orders partially offset by labor inflation. We expect labor costs to be in the low 24% range during Q2 through the benefit or delivery menu price increase as well as seasonally higher sales. Other operating costs for the quarter were 16.9% an increase of 200 basis points from last year due to higher delivery fees, which were partially offset by sales leverage and a one-time insurance credit. Delivery expenses remained elevated year-over-year given the significant growth in delivery and as you may have seen, we increased our delivery menu prices by 4% earlier this month to help cover the higher cost of this premium access point. And we'll continue to evaluate and fine tune our delivery strategy in this dynamic market. Marketing promo cost of the quarter were 3.5% a decrease of 20 basis points from last year given a significantly lower level of delivery promotion this year. While, we invested more marketing dollars in order to score in quesadilla and cauliflower rice, as well as the first ever Super Bowl ad. While [existing] [ph] marketing expenses to be in the mid 2% range in Q2, time period tends to be less responsive from those advertising channel. Similar to past few year, full year 2021 marketing expense is expected to be around 3% of sales. Lower marketing spend in Q2, other operating costs are expected to be around 16% for the quarter. In Q1 restaurant level margin was 22.3%, while our trailing 12 month average unit volumes excluding the delivery menu price increase were roughly $2.27 million normalizing for the higher marketing spend, our underlying restaurant level margin was essentially in line with theoretical margin of 22.7% expected at the sales volume. We're pleased with this progress and we remain confident that we have taken and will continue to take the necessary actions to ensure the margin stays on the algorithm as our AUVs rise throughout the year. In fact, we expect our trailing 12-month average unit volumes to pass $2.4 million in Q2, we expect our margin algorithm to keep pace. G&A for the quarter was $155 million on a GAAP basis or $129 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $24.4 million for the previously mentioned modification to our 2018 performance shares and about $1.6 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also includes $89 million in underlying G&A, $30 million related to non-cash stock compensation, which includes the $7.7 million increase related to our strong performance in Q1 and $10 billion related to higher bonus accrual and payroll taxes and equity vesting and stock option exercises. Looking to Q2, we expect our underlying G&A to be around $94 million as we continue to make investments including in technology to support our future growth. We anticipate stock comp will likely be around $25 million in each of the remaining quarters in 2021 to reflect the new round rate, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance. We also expect to recognize around $5 million in each quarter related to performance based bonus expenses and employer taxes associated [Technical Difficulty] during each quarter, as well as $1 million related to our upcoming Virtual Field Leadership Conference in Q2. Our effective tax rate for Q1 was 20.2% on a GAAP basis and 18.5% on a non-GAAP basis. Our effective tax rate benefited from option exercise and share vesting had elevated stock prices. As I'm sure you know, we received a tax deduction for the value our employees received upon option exercise or share vesting, when the net value exceeds the accounting charge of those shares, we'd benefit from a higher tax deduction. For fiscal 2021, we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in a 25% to 27% range though it may vary based on discrete items such as the equity related impact I just mentioned. Turning now to the balance sheet, we ended Q1 with $1.2 billion in cash restricted cash and investments with no debt along with a recently refinanced $500 million untapped revolver with a five year term and more favorable terms in our previous facility. We also restarted our buyback program in late February when our stock price up and we repurchased $61 million of our stock and average price of $1,425 during the quarter. We had nearly $154 million remaining on our share authorization as of March 31. We expect to continue to opportunistically use excess free cash flow to repurchase our stock. That being said the best use of our cash remains investing in more Chipotle, which continue to deliver outstanding returns. We opened 40 new restaurants in the first quarter more than doubled the number opened in Q1 last year with 26 of these including in Chipotlanes. While only 65% of the new units had Chipotlanes in Q1 for the full year, we still anticipate opening around 200 new restaurants with more than 70% including Chipotle lane. As of March 31, we had a total of Chipotlanes including five conversions. Customers love the Chipotle lane experience, as it is the access channel that excels at providing convenient, speed and great value all at the same time. Performance continues to be stellar. In the trailing 12 months Chipotle lane restaurant continue to drive 17% higher overall digital sales compared to non-Chipotle lane. In order ahead, our highest marketing transaction is nearly 80% higher than non-Chipotle lane, while delivery our lowest margin transaction is about 30% lower than our non-Chipotle lane restaurants. New Chipotlanes are opening with about 15% higher sales and the comp at the 69 Chipotle lane restaurants that have been opened more than a year continues to outperform the non-Chipotle lane restaurants from the same open period. Beyond the significant growth opportunity in the U.S., we're excited to accelerate new restaurant openings in Canada, which was recently validated by our stage gate process. We're building a healthy new restaurant pipeline and expect to open a handful of restaurants over the next 12 months, including our first Chipotle lane in late summer. We'll continue to experiment with different location formats and restaurant designs throughout the country to gauge consumer preferences. Ultimately, we believe we can open at least a few 100 restaurants in Canada, especially what their unit economic now approaching those of the U.S. The recent Surrey British Columbia opening which is our first new Canadian location for years opened very strong and gives us even greater confidence about our growth strategy. We close by thanking all of our team members who've proven their agility to operate through uncertainty, while also staying focused on our long-term purpose, their commitment to constant improvement of the customer dining experience, while strengthening our branded business is what helps drive our strategic growth initiatives. The combination of investing in our people, delivering the relevant and compelling marketing, leveraging our digital systems to enhance convenient access and great execution of the restaurants is leading to a better guest experience which ultimately allows us to further strengthen our powerful economic model. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from David Tarantino of Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. My question is really about the reopening of the dining rooms to more full extent and the resumption of consumer activity we're starting to see as the vaccines roll out. And I guess, Brian or Jack, can you elaborate on what you're seeing as that activity returns in terms of sales and mix? And then, secondly, based on what you're seeing as the dining room traffic might be coming back, how are you thinking about the overall unit volume opportunity in the U.S. assuming that some of these digital transactions might stick? Thanks. Brian Niccol : Yes. Hey, thanks, David. Look, what we're definitely seeing is, people want to be back in our dining rooms. I've had the luxury of traveling recently. And Scott and I've been to numerous restaurants and it's great to see the lines, again, in our dining rooms. And we're seeing a nice rebound, obviously, in those dining room sales because there weren't any a year ago. And at the same time, what we're seeing is our digital business is really continuing to thrive. In the quarter, I don't know if you guys picked up on this, but when we had record sales for our digital business, despite the fact that our dining rooms are opening. So I think it just demonstrates the power of both access modes, meaning the in-restaurant dining access mode and the digital access mode. And then, not surprising you're seeing the occasions come back based on whether you're coming into the dining room, or whether you're ordering off-premise. And that's more tied to help open the region is, is how I would kind of describe it. So we're feeling great about where we are. Consumer sentiment is definitely one where they want to get back out to socialize and get back into the dining rooms and have that in-dining experience. And then, at the same token for those occasions that they've built, the behaviors around digitally, those are remaining in the business and I think that's why you're seeing our results in Q1. And frankly, why I'm really proud of our team is that we're managing these two businesses out of one kitchen with really added excellence. David Tarantino : Great. And then, my other question is on the quesadilla. And I guess, from a consumer behavior uptake, it sounds like you're getting a high incidence for that product. Do you have information that would tell you whether that's kind of new customers or incremental customers or existing customers trying the product? I guess, what do you think the incrementality of that might look like? Brian Niccol : Yes. So you're exactly right, David, the incidence is high. We're in that 10% range. I think is what we discovered. And the thing is really exciting is, it's comprised of a lot of new users. So we're seeing two things happen. A lot of new users come into the business through the quesadilla proposition, and then our existing customers, we're also seeing them utilize that quesadilla platform as part of a new eating occasion. So, it was actually our highest penetration of new customers in the month of March, which I think is just a testament to, one, people coming back to the dining rooms; and two, I think, a really meaningful innovation around quesadilla. David Tarantino : Great. Thanks so much. Brian Niccol : Yep. Operator : The next question comes from Jon Tower of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jon Tower : Great. Thanks. Hopefully, you can hear me, okay? Just curious on the delivery side of the equation. It sounds like Jack, you'd mentioned the company has taken another 4% or so pricing in the delivery channel during the quarter. Where does that set the delivery occasion now relative to an in-store transaction? And do you feel like there's even more potential to take pricing in that channel, if necessary down the line? And when I ask the percentage piece on a margin basis to gross as well? Brian Niccol : Jon, you cut out at the very end. Jon Tower : Okay. I was just asking gross profit dollar versus the margin percentage when it comes to the delivery transaction? How those have changed with the incremental pricing versus the restaurant transaction? Brian Niccol : Yes. Jack, you want me to take that, or you want me to start or\u2026 Jack Hartung : Yes. I'll go ahead and start Brian. Brian Niccol : Okay. Jack Hartung : Listen, the last price increase that we took, it doesn't get us all the way to where a delivery transaction -- delivers the same margin as an in-store transaction. And certainly not as much as our highest transaction, the order ahead. [Technical Difficulty] very, very close. From a dollar standpoint, they're pretty close. But as you know, when you are charging higher prices, you're grossing up the sales. And so it makes it a little harder to fully capture that margin. But I would say, we're within striking distance where, maybe a few percentage points away if we wanted to completely equalize, the margin on an in-store transaction for a delivery. So we've made a lot of progress over the last year. And when we've taken these increases along the way, we've seen either acceptable resistance. And we've also seen what looks like people are shifting channels, because it does look like our order ahead moves up, when we do see customers maybe resist the higher pricing and delivery channels a bit. Jon Tower : Great. And if I may, on the loyalty side of the equation, I believe, Brian, you'd mentioned earlier, there is some efforts internally to improve engagement per customer feedback that you've received. So what have you heard from customers in the loyalty program [Technical Difficulty] done today? Brian Niccol : Yes. So you kind of cut out near the end, but I think I got the gist of the question, which is, how are we seeing more customers become more engaged within our rewards program? And the simple answer on that is, I think, we've gotten a lot smarter with the analytics. So that, I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, we're really trying to figure out how we move just from a commerce experience to an engagement experience. And so what you're seeing is, the power of that playing out by people shopping more often, with Chipotle experimenting with other things on the menu. And obviously, there's going to be further enhancements to our rewards program going forward because we want to respond to our customers to keep them engaged in this rewards program. Jon Tower : Great. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Sara Senatore : Oh, thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit about the loyalty members and also your comment about the 40% I think you set up delivery orders coming through proprietary apps. So first, just the loyalty members, I guess, do you have a sense of what percentage of your total customers that might represent if you have a certain 80 million, 100 million unique customers, something like that? I guess I'm trying to sort of reconcile the loyalty membership with your -- the delivery orders or the digital orders that are coming through your native apps, because it seems like the share of orders that are coming through your own ordering platform has gone up. And I'm trying to figure out, are you shifting people away from a third-party by virtue of incentivizing them through loyalty or that kind of thing? Or is it just that the people who are ordering directly are very high spending customers and they're the sort of minority that will ultimately download your apps versus preferring the convenience of a have an aggregator platform? I know, there's a lot in there, but I'm trying to understand sort of the power of -- the Chipotle brand versus like, kind of like, call it, the convenience of the aggregators and who owns the customer there? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, I think were you just ended your question is the answer, which is, we have a very powerful brand. And as a result, when people join our rewards program, download the app and start ordering through our app, and they realize that they have the access of order ahead and pick up whether it's at a Chipotle lane, order ahead and pick up meaning, I can grab it off the shelf and go, or I can get delivery through our app. In all those occasions, you are able to accrue points and get recognized for being an engaged customer. And we're providing lots of access, lots of convenience, with a very powerful brand position behind it. And that's why I think you're seeing our order ahead business continue to grow, our white label or delivery business in our app continuing to grow as a percentage of the delivery occasion. And I think it's just a function of the brand continues to resonate, our first strategy is all about building the brand, trust and love. And I think while we do that and provide a great experience, both digitally and for whatever occasion you want associate with that digital experience. And then, you give them rewards, it's a really powerful system that keeps people engaged. Sara Senatore : Great. That makes a lot of sense. And then, just do you have any sense of like, kind of what share of Chipotle customers are on your loyalty program versus ultimately what you might get to? Brian Niccol : Well, look, we've got 21 million customers, in the rewards program, 60% of those are active, ongoing. And then, we've got programs with those that we see lapsing. But we don't see a whole lot of crossover, still between the dining room experience and the digital experience, there's only 10%, 15% that are doing both occasions. So there is still a lot of upside in getting our dining rooms reopen for that customer experience, customer occasion. And that's why I think the earlier question I got, I'm so optimistic about our dining rooms reopening because it's not cannibalizing from our digital business. These are really two distinct occasions that people want to have access to great food with integrity. So there's 100 million Chipotle customers coming through these doors. And the good news is, we know when we get that dining room open there's a lot of people that are going to come back that we haven't seen in a while. Operator : The next question comes from Lauren Silberman of Credit Suisse. Lauren Silberman : So on quesadilla, as you move through the Stage Gate process, you talked a lot about your focus on operations, the quesadilla is now available across the system. Are you seeing any impact on throughput or operations relative to what you expected? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, I'm really happy to say the Stage Gate process worked. Because two things. One, we've got the right kitchen equipment to create a great product at great speed. And then two, we got the right operational process in place. So, if in the event somebody does order still on the frontline, obviously our guys will figure out how to accommodate it, but it is a much faster experience with a much better product. So we've improved our employees experience when that happens. And then, for our customers, their learning, the quesadilla made to be an off-premise solution with Chipotle's food. And I think it's a testament to our teams, our operators that validated it, our marketers that have explained to customers how to use it, and then, the marriage of our technology to actually get the transaction in place. So it's a great example of using the Stage Gate process in the most effective way possible. Lauren Silberman : And I think you've thought, you had the expectations for quesadilla incidents to normalize in Q2. So just to clarify, do you expect the mix to settle below the 10%? And then, how does the attachment rate to the [quack] [ph] inside compared to what you see with burritos and bowls? Brian Niccol : Yes. So look, we're just saying we're only what a couple weeks into this. And the good news is, we haven't seen -- go backwards yet. So and the feedback from our customers, are they loving it. The attachment rate looks really good. It's frankly, a little bit better than our burritos and bowls. So I think that's the power of showing our food going really well with [indiscernible]. And again, it's Chipotle's food is really good and guess what, it's really good when it's in a quesadilla. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer. Brian, your line is open. Next question comes from Peter Saleh of BTIG. Peter Saleh : I want to come back to the conversation around delivery menu price increases. You guys mentioned a 4% increase most recently. I think the test that you guys were running was substantially higher than that on the delivery price increase. So can you talk a little bit about the -- did you see pushback on the test? And why did you decide on a 4%? Why was that the right amount of a price increase to take? Brian Niccol : Yes. So just to clarify, or go ahead, Jack? Jack Hartung : Brian, you're probably going to say the same thing I would. Peter, just to clarify, we are running 13 in most of our restaurants across the country. We had a few that were at different levels, so we could see the differences. We took the entire country up another 4%. So we're now charging a plus 17. And the reason we did that was we were comfortable that the resistance that we saw was acceptable resistance that we did see people move into other convenience and other value driven channels. So I think that's a testament to. We had the 13% price increase running for several months. And we were very comfortable that we could go another 4%. So the 4% we just took earlier this month was an addition. Peter Saleh : Great understood. All right. And then, just on the Chipotle lane conversions, I know you have around 400 freestanding stores and a 1500 to 1600 end-caps. Have you guys thought a little bit more about how many conversions you can actually do? I know I think the quarter or two ago, you said potential for several 100? Has that number increased at all? Jack Hartung : It hasn't changed per se. Our desire to have more Chipotlanes and to push the percentage of new restaurants that open with each Chipotle lane. We want to continue to push the envelope there. And then with conversions, we want to opportunistically look at relocations and rebuilds that -- remodels where we can add a Chipotle lane. We still think that we can have hundreds of conversions. It's hard to pin that down though, because, in essence, what you do is, we have to as we approach the end of a lease term. Like let's say you've got a 10-year primary term with options, when you get to year seven or eight that's the time you have the conversation with landlords. If you've tried to have the conversation with landlords to try to get permission to modify the space in year two or three, when you've got seven years left, landlord doesn't really want to have that conversation. So we have those conversations and we have many of them throughout the year. If you look back to 10 years ago, we will have 100 or more, maybe in the 100 to 150 range, where we're having conversations with landlords. Those conversations are going well. But it's too early to tell exactly how many hundreds of these conversions we can get, we're definitely pushing the envelope. Operator : The next question comes from David Palmer of Evercore ISI. David Palmer : So I just wanted to get a few clues from you about how the sales layers might shake out after the full reopen, after we get past all the vaccinations and things get up and running at least reasonably so I'm sure work commute will be -- there'll be some areas will be lagging there. But what do you see from some of your early and most reopened markets in terms of that on-premise business sales layer. It looks like overall on-premise might be only 70% of pre-COVID levels right now as a system. But where is that getting to in some of your most reopened markets? And when it does get to that level? How much is your off-premise business, the digital side, really hanging in there? And I have a quick follow up. Brian Niccol : Yes. So David, the way to think about it is, like in our regions that are the most open, obviously, you're not that far off on your average of the return in our dining business, the places where we're more open, we're above the average. And the thing that I love to see is, regardless, our digital business is maintaining that 80% to 85% run rate. The thing that's also exciting, though, is, as I mentioned, in the quarter, we still had record levels of digital business. And that's because we're going to continue to use our system called rewards, quesadillas to drive people further and further commitment on our digital platform for those occasions where it make sense. So, in the places where we're more open, we got more of our dining room business back, and our digital business is hanging in there. I'd say it's actually our digital businesses, operating from a position of strength. And then, the places where it's slower, the dining room has come back, thank heavens, we've got such a strong digital business. David Palmer : And I guess this might be one for Jack, in terms of how you think about sales and margins over time, in the past, you've had a rule of thumb of your AUVs tracking with margins, the way the world is working feels like sales will be higher on average for the average company out there. But margins may be more challenged for the average company out there. You might have some better defense mechanisms than others in terms your digital business and whatnot. But how are you thinking about that relationship? Is that changing, even as you see some of the recent measures you've been taking? And I'll pass it on. Jack Hartung : Yes. David, listen, we still feel very confident that our margin algorithm is alive and well. We made some important steps over the last several months, so that we're within striking distance of that algorithm. And we see from here on out as our volumes grow, our AUV was [2.17] [ph] million and as we grow to 2.4. 2.5 etc, etc, we think that our margin will move to 24 and 25. Now, that's not going to happen every single quarter, it's not going to be perfect. But in terms of seeing our margins move up with our volumes, we still expect that to happen. Now there is a slight degradation as you move from 2.5 million to 3 million, for example, you might not get to all the way to 30% in terms of the margin for a $3 million restaurant, but you certainly should get in the 28% to 29% range. So we still fully expect that we'll be able to expand margins. And one of the things that's enabling that is, with the growth -- the significant growth in the delivery business that has been still is our lowest margin transaction. But we've close the gaps considerably and our customers are still choosing that channel or they're choosing another channel. So giving the customers choice and let them pay for the more extreme convenience channel of delivery, let them pay the going rate seems to be a workable strategy for us. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Charles of Cowen. Andrew Charles : Brian, based on the experience with quesadilla, how [open minded] [ph] are you around future digital only menu innovation that can't be done on the front make line, such as the potential for nachos and enchiladas. And perhaps from an ops perspective, are you confined to only one to two possible digital innovations in the new ovens? Or could there be several more items launched before you become capacity constrained on this digital make lines? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, the good news is, we're far from capacity constraints on those digital make lines and we're continuing to make enhancements to our digital make line, so that our employees become even more accurate, more efficient. The equipment that we've chosen gives us a lot of flexibility, whether it's additional entr\u00e9es or desserts, or whatever it may be. The good news is we got a lot of great ideas in our culinary team, obviously, we'll bet them through the Stage Gate process. But, look, the goal is to be balanced, at the end of the day, we want to have a great experience in the restaurant and a great experience, if you choose to go digital. And I don't think you're going to see us ever get out of equilibrium, where we're providing a great experience for whatever channel, it could be. I don't want to come across this DML all of a sudden, you're doing something every month. That's not who we are. Who we are, are great ingredients done in very simple ways, so that you can customize. And the good news is, we've got lots of capacity on that line. And now we've got more flexibility because of the additional equipment that we have. So not surprising, I think there's a lot of growth still to be had on their digital business. And there's still tremendous growth to be had in our dining business. Andrew Charles : That's helpful. Then Jack, I have a follow up question on development. This might be a little technical, but looking at the proxy, it looks like there were 324 site assessment requests over the next 12 to 18 months. That's about 50% higher versus the 227 that was in the proxy from a year ago. And so, when I look at the guidance for 200 store openings this year, it's not quite 50%, above the 161 you did last year. So, in terms of the guidance for 200 openings, besides conservatism, just on the availability of construction crews, is there anything else in there that might be presenting pressure on 2021development? Jack Hartung : No, I would say it's more of a timeline challenge. We've seen that the timeline have elongated over the last, year or two or so. And so, this year, for example, we target 200, first quarter was exactly on pace to do 200. I think you can expect us to see, to open up similar numbers in Q2 and Q3. Now, what might happen, Andrew, we might overperform a bit in the fourth quarter. It's too early to say that right now, we certainly have a very healthy pipeline. That pipeline is chock full of a bolt line. So, we think the numbers go up from here, not down. But right now the responsible number of 200, I think still applies. But let's see how things shape up in quarter two and three, what the fourth quarter looks like. Operator : The next question comes from Nicole Miller of Piper Sandler. Nicole Miller : Just one question for me. I'm curious about, traditionally thinking about restaurants and unit level economics. And what I'm wondering is, with your 21 million loyalty relationships in the CRM platform you're talking about, can you talk now about customer lifetime value? Like, what's the economics of a customer? Now that you found some of them outside of the four walls of the store? Brian Niccol : Yes, it's a great question, Nicole. One of the reasons why we're so I guess optimistic about our rewards program is, these reward members versus non-reward members, they're coming more often and they're also spending more. So that's obviously a great outcome of putting somebody into a rewards program. And then, I think the team has really become so much more sophisticated in our ability to understand what they want from Chipotle. And as a result, you're going to see us making some further enhancements to the rewards program and the experiences that people can have. So they will be even further engaged. And the whole reason why we're doing that is because we think we can get even more frequency out of people and potentially continue to influence that check further. So it's a very valuable asset. And I think it's going to continue to become more valuable. Operator : The next question comes from Jared Garber of Goldman Sachs. Jared Garber : I wanted to touch base on the labor environment and what you guys are seeing from that respect, obviously, we've heard a lot in the news lately about the availability of labor and the challenges of staffing up. So I wonder if you could talk there, a little bit about what you're seeing and if you're seeing those similar challenges play out. And then, as it relates to that, how you guys think about potential pricing power and/or pricing in different markets? Thanks. Brian Niccol : Sure. So, obviously, one of the things that's great is, we're seeing, the economy come back in a big way, with customers out of the balloting, getting back to the business of -- it's a normalcy. With that, obviously, we are quick to want to step up our restaurants accordingly, to be in sync with where our business is growing. The positive is, it came back really fast in March. The negative in that is, you got to play a little bit of catch up with the staffing. But I think our employee value proposition is world-class. And as people realize these opportunities are available, usually we have no problem with the applicant flow. And then, we turn our attention to training and developing these individuals, because it's a great opportunity for not just the job now, but a future career. So, it's great to see the business come roaring back, it's also exciting to see our need to staff more people because that is the growth that we like to have. We like to have growth that results in more jobs and more people having upward opportunities. We had, I think 13,000 plus promotions recently. So, I mean, that's just a testament to the growth that we have, the strength of our proposition for those that stay with us commit themselves to being developed and trained. And then, obviously, we're going to staff accordingly, as the business comes forward and back. So I'm very optimistic about the people we can attract, the culture that we create for them and then the opportunities that are available for them. And what was the second part of your question? Jared Garber : Just as it relates to kind of increasing wage pressures across the industry, how you guys think about mitigating that through price increases? Obviously, you've taken on delivery, but more broadly across even like the dine-in side of the business and how you think about that geographically as well? Brian Niccol : Yes. I think we've talked about this in the past, the good news is our value proposition is, I would say top, top tier. And so that gives us a lot of flexibility on how we price and when we price. We've taken a very conservative approach on it. We've been more in that 1% to 2% range on an annual basis. I mean Jack has talked about is that usually offsets any labor inflation that we deal with. So, I think we're in a really strong situation, both from a brand value proposition and then the ability to attract and retain people with our employee value proposition. Operator : Next question comes from Andy Barish of Jefferies. Andy Barish : Just taking that a little bit further. I know, some of the traditional metrics of, I've kind of gotten a little bit skewed by everything going on right now. But can you quantify sort of what type of wage inflation you're seeing? And then, also on the commodity front? Certainly the commodity proteins have been significantly higher, just wondering if you're starting to see that, in the non-commodity markets that you're buying from? Jack Hartung : Yes. I'll take this. First of all, Andy, in the last year, what we've seen with labor inflation has it's -- and more modest than it had been in the last five years. And last five years, we've seen inflation and kind of the mid-single digit range and with some of the dislocation going on with COVID. Actually, the labor inflation dropped to the low single digits. But we expect I think most people expect that's going to tick back up. And let me just give you an example because the other thing that you might be thinking about is, what if we have a national minimum wage, that's -- that over time approaches $15. Now, the way to think about this is our minimum wage, or our average wage right now, is $12 for our crew, it's $13 for all of our hourly employees. We're not that far off of like, for example, a $15 number. But let's say for example, that there's going to be an across the board, 10% increase in our wages, that would have an impact on our margins, I will call it 150 to 200 basis points. And that would to offset that with menu pricing that will take a 2% to 3% price increase. So all of that is very, very manageable. And we feel like if there is going to be significant increased inflation there because of market driven or because of federal minimum wage. We think everybody in the restaurant industry is going to have to pass those costs along to the customer. And we think we're in a much, much better position to do that, than other companies out there. In terms of commodities, the one that we're seeing for sure and this is more of a seasonal shift that we see pretty much every year is avocados. We are going to see an increase in avocado prices as we shift into the next season. We don't see anything else moving up dramatically right now, Andy. I mean, I think everyone's kind of waiting to see what happens in terms of demand and if there are any disruptions with supply chain, we're not seeing any that we're worried about right now. But with everyone talking about with the stimulus and the reopening and the vaccine, there is going to be a surge in demand. And we think we're well prepared from supply chain standpoint. But that's the only kind of wildcard as the year unfolds is. Will there be maybe a cyclical or interim dislocation where maybe there is some commodity inflation, but nothing that we're seeing right now. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Vaccaro of Raymond James. Brian Vaccaro : I was hoping to better understand the sales cadence that you saw through the first quarter, perhaps you could comment on the two year stack by month and where that stood quarter-to-date in April. And then, I know you mentioned more normal quesadilla incidents. But could you walk us through kind of the other puts and takes that you considered as you set the second quarter sales guidance? Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So, obviously, the first quarter, I think Jack covered it in his remarks, the geometric average was in -- the 20%, 21% range. I would obviously tell you, January was a really good start, February, kind of flattish and March was really strong. Obviously, you got a much easier rollover. And then, we talked about all the things we did around launching quesadilla and dining room, start to reopen, so on and so forth. As you move into April, if you think about this two year, I think that's probably the best way to think about our business right now, because of what you're seeing in kind of the, the year ago, performance on Easter, and so on and so forth. The good news is, we've seen days and weeks where you're in the 20s, and we've seen days in weeks, where you're in the high teens, so it's bouncing around a little bit. And I think a lot of things are driving that, right, you're still seeing things flash around COVID in different parts of the country. Unfortunately, we had the pause and the vaccines. So you've got some consumer sentiment, I think, bouncing around, which obviously plays a role. And then, obviously, we're going to be more in the leverage phase of our quesadilla launch versus our launch phase, which is what we're taking into account as we think it'll normalize as you go down into the rest of the quarter. So, those are some of the puts in calls, we're in a couple weeks into the second quarter. We love where we are and we'll see how the rest of the quarter unfolds, because I think we've got the right strategies. So, we're going to stay focused on what we know has been working for us. Brian Vaccaro : And could you also comment on California, specifically, obviously, a big important market for you? Could you just ballpark where volumes there are versus the rest of the country? And have you seen an acceleration more recently as COVID restrictions are lifted? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, I mean, this is not just a California phenomenon. This is a phenomenon that's happening across the country, which is, as I think places see a reduction in COVID cases and an increase in vaccines and people get back to maybe their old habits, as well as some of the habits they've created in this new environment. You see the business respond accordingly. So more people being out and about results in really good things for a restaurant concept like us, because they only around about Chipotle is a great option. Obviously, we've demonstrated we're a great option when you need that off-premise occasion as well. So the dining rooms become more open, people are more confident to be out and about that bodes well for us in every state. So it's not just the California phenomenon. That's an American phenomenon. Brian Vaccaro : Yes. Makes perfect sense. I'm in Atlanta, and I see it every day. So makes pretty good sense. Thank you. I will pass it along. Operator : The next question comes from Chris O\u2019Cull of Stifel. Chris O\u2019Cull: Brian, I was curious what you believe the risk may be to sales growth from pulling the cauliflower rice, I think you said in mid-May? Brian Niccol : Look, I think this is a great initiative that we did. I've mentioned in the past, our goal is to keep people engaged with our menu. We'll have some things on for time period, and then take them off and bring them back. What we've seen, where we've tested this in the past is, it's not anything that results in us taking pause and moving forward with our strategy of taking it out in May. So, the good news is, we've got a lot of strength in the business. I'm sure it'll be something we'll bring back down the road. But, we feel really good about our strategy of having some items that come off the menu and other items like the quesadilla that'll be permanently on the menu. Chris O\u2019Cull: And then, I was curious if you're seeing a similar level of beverage attachment rate with dine in usage today that you saw pre-pandemic? Brian Niccol : Well, look, I think Jack's talked about this, that's one of the things that's been a little bit of a drag is, as people stop coming into dining rooms, our beverage incidents went down. We fully anticipate as the dining rooms come back, we'll recapture that beverage incidents and things really start to normalize. I think we've got another shot at making people aware of the new tractor beverage offering, which the reason why we initially did that is, we were hoping to drive more beverage incidents. So that's our plan. As the dining rooms come back, our plan is to figure out how we can drive more beverage incidents accordingly. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session, I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Brian Niccol : Okay. Well, thank you, everybody and thanks for all the questions. I just want to start off with first saying how immensely proud I am of all of the Chipotle employees. I think what we've seen in the last quarter, and frankly, the last year is the power of great people, great culture, being focused on the things that needed to be handled right now. And it's pretty powerful to see an organization of 100,000 people come together and do the right thing for each other and their community. So very proud of this organization, very proud of our employees. And look, I think we're off to a great start in '21 because our employees have demonstrated the resiliency of our business. I'm confident that we will continue to do the right things, so that as the dining rooms reopen, we will give people great experiences, we'll continue to invest in our digital business that's not done growing, as evidenced by what we shared here. And then, obviously, we talked about this too, we're very committed to seeing the AUV margin algorithm come to life. And that's really exciting to see that starting to emerge in a meaningful way. And then, lastly, it's really exciting to be building 40 plus restaurants in a quarter, we're going to build from here. And I think we're well on our way to getting back to the business of Chipotle growing in a meaningful way, both top-line, bottom-line and new units. And then, that results in great opportunities for all our people that have just demonstrated the power of the Chipotle culture and the Chipotle purpose. So thank you for joining. Thank you for listening and I look forward to touching base in a quarter Take care. Operator : The conference is now concluded.

We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian. Brian Niccol : Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. Chipotle second quarter results highlight the strength of our brand and our people, as we demonstrated growing momentum in our business. Over the past 15 months, our teams have done an admirable job navigating and executing against macro complexities while giving us great optimism for where we go from here. While COVID challenges remain, including uncertainty regarding the impact of the Delta variant, I'm confident that our teams are up to the challenge and we're hopeful that we'll gradually see a more stable environment over time. Specific to Chipotle, we're pleased that all of our restaurants are now open and most are back to normal operations. For the quarter, we reported sales of $1.9 billion, representing 38.7% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by 31.2% comparable restaurant sales growth; restaurant level margin of 24.5%, was more than doubled the 12.2% we reported last year; earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $7.46, representing a significant increase over the $0.40 reported last year; digital sales growth of 10.5% year-over-year, representing 48.5% of sales; and we opened 56 new restaurants, including 45 with the Chipotlane. And I'm delighted to report that Q3 is also off to a strong start. While our trailing 12 month AUV is $2.41 million, the underlying run rate during the quarter is now above the historical peak of $2.5 million AUV. When we started this transformation a little over three years ago, I was often asked whether I thought we could get back to our peak $2.5 million volumes. My answer was, yes, and when we achieve it, we will talk about growth beyond that. So it's a nice achievement for organization to have $2.5 million AUVs again. But more importantly, we have growth strategies that will take us to the next leg of our journey, $3 million AUVs, along with industry-leading returns on invested capital that improve as we continue to add Chipotlanes. Stronger restaurant level economics combined with significant unit growth should allow us to optimize earnings power for many years to come. In fact, we remain confident in our key growth strategies and believe that over the longer term, they will allow us to have 6,000 restaurants in North America with AUVs pushing well beyond $3 million. Yes, the opportunity ahead of us remain significant. So, what are the key strategies that are resonating with guests and allowing us to win today while we create the future? To no one's surprise, they are the same ones we've been talking about for some time, namely opening and running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; leveraging digital capabilities to drive productivity and expand access, convenience and engagement; engaging with customers through our loyalty program to drive transactions in frequency; making the brand visible, relevant and loved; and utilizing a disciplined approach to creativity and innovation. Let me now provide a brief update on each of these, starting with our outstanding operations. This is a key focal point, as our business is building on our digital gains along with in-restaurant strength due to a more confident and mobile consumer, as well as the hard work our team has done to build more love for Chipotle. We've continued to make operational adjustments to adapt to the constantly changing environment, which has led us to recovering about 70% of in-restaurant sales thus far, while retaining about 80% of digital sales. It's no secret that running great restaurants requires great people with a terrific culture and we are privileged to have the best of both. Despite the labor challenges in certain parts of the country, the team has remained focused on safety, reliability, excellent culinary and experiences. I'm extremely proud of our world-class employee value proposition. We're providing industry-leading benefits, including a new virtual mental health platform, expanded debt-free degrees, attractive wages that were recently increased to an average of $15 per hour, specialized job training and development and significant career advancement opportunities. And because more than 90% of our restaurant management roles are internal promotes, employees who joined the Chipotle family know they have the opportunity to grow their careers with us. Through investing in our people, we have been able to maintain the stability of our workforce over the last two years. Knowing that our people are the key to our growth, we have been diligent in our recruiting focus since the start of the year. In reimagining the [Indiscernible] experience, we're leveraging partnerships that allow us to engage in authentic conversations with prospective candidates and share all the opportunity Chipotle has to offer. Our Coast to Coast Career Day event last week resulted in us hiring thousands of additional team members to meet current demand and accommodate future growth. These efforts have dramatically helped to improve our labor position, and as a result, our restaurants are attracting and retaining excellent employees in a tough labor environment. After visiting several restaurants this past month, I'm encouraged to see more and more guests enjoying their meals in our dining rooms. They order Chipotle, because they can get the exact customized meal they want made with real ingredients faster than anywhere else. As a result, we are committed to teaching, training and validating the five pillars of throughput every day during every shift to ensure we meet our high standards and provide a great guest experience. Over the past few years, Chipotle has evolved to a point where we now have two sizable businesses in-restaurant as well as our record-breaking digital platform that are helping us become a real food focused digital lifestyle brand. During the second quarter, digital sales grew about 11% year-over-year to $916 million and represented nearly 49% of sales. While COVID has, of course, helped bolster these digital gains, ongoing technology investments and operational excellence have been the critical success factors. Some examples of the digital innovations we've introduced include the addition of our concierge chatbot, Pepper, to the Chipotle app, which has the ability to answer common questions and resolve issues more efficiently, thus freeing up our customer care teams' time to help the guest with more complicated situations. We also gave guests the ability to easily rate their order rate in the app and online at chipotle.com, providing our restaurant operations teams with actionable insights on how to maintain and improve the digital guest experience. Additionally, we have opened a digital-only kitchen, continued expanding our digital drive-throughs with Chipotlanes being the majority of our new restaurant openings, refreshed group ordering and invested in digital internationally by launching the Chipotle app in Canada and implementing our digital assets in Europe. While the results and positive feedback on these innovations show us we're on the right track, we know there is still more to do to enhance the customer experience by expanding access and minimizing friction. Not only are we pleased with the level of digital sales and overall mix, we're also delighted to see that our highest margin transaction, digital pickup orders is gaining traction, and we expect this to continue as we add more Chipotlanes and customers experience the value of this occasion. As I mentioned earlier, we held onto about 80% of our digital gains exiting Q2. This highlights our digital experience's sticky because it is everything customers love about Chipotle with added convenience. And due to the pandemic, many new consumers were introduced to Chipotle via our digital channels and are now using us for alternative and often incremental occasions. Naturally, we believe our digital sales mix will moderate as capacity restrictions ease and guests feel more comfortable physically ordering and dining in our restaurants. However, we expect absolute digital sales dollars to find a new equilibrium in 2021 and grow from there. We're encouraged to see that so far in July, we continued to hold on to these digital gains even as in-store recovery has strengthened. Moving next to the loyalty program, which is a key enabler of our digital ecosystem and an expanding network that now has more than 23 million members. With this large base of consumers, Chipotle can distribute its own content, more and more effectively, and drive deeper levels of engagement within this community than ever before. We are leveraging our CRM platform to drive brand engagement and send personalized messages to help supercharge our super fans. We have proven that we can influence decisions along a guests buying journey when we offer them the right individually tailored offers at the right time. We're continuously improving our analytics and are consistently able to generate more transactions from light, medium and high frequency users. With the recent announcement of Rewards Exchange, we're optimistic we can continue to build upon our success. The updated functionality provides greater customization and flexibility to redeem rewards and allows guests to earn rewards faster, all of which is expected to improve engagement and drive additional frequency. While we are off to a terrific start, we will continue to invest in the program to take it to the next level and have other enhancements to the program that are expected to be rolled out by year-end. While the loyalty program is used to help drive frequency, our marketing efforts are primarily designed to bring more people to the brand. The combination of reach-based media and a successful frequency driven loyalty program make a great one-two punch that both brings in new users and increases transactions with our existing customers. The marketing team continues to ensure that relevant creative across a wide variety of media channels enables the brands remain visible and live at the intersection of Chipotle and culture. Their agile approach, innovative mindset and relentless commitment to measurement have led to ongoing success. For example, our campaign to support the Quesadilla launch was omnichannel with relevant creative across online video, digital and social media platforms, as well as via traditional TV spots. We also celebrated Team Chipotle, a group of American athletes who love the brand long before they became famous. Their personalized unwrapped videos provide an inside look at Chipotle athlete super fans and what it takes to compete at the highest level. It also highlights the training hard and eating real food with real ingredients go hand in hand. Furthermore, our burritos and Bitcoin campaign around National Burrito Day was one of our most successful social initiatives to date, with billions of impressions for this culturally relevant promotion. These are just a few examples of the brand's work to drive culture, drive difference and ultimately driving a purchase. Another important pillar of our marketing efforts is a steady stream of new menu innovation, with a cadence of on average about two to three per year. Cauliflower rice was a seasonal item that enhance our Lifestyle Bowls and a successful bringing in new guests. We launched Quesadillas as a permanent digital exclusive offering in March, and this menu item continues to perform well as it appears in about 10% of our transactions, and it's also helping attract new customers to Chipotle. Our talented culinary team is far from finished and our pipeline is filled with promise. I'm pleased to report that smoked brisket has been validated by our stage-gate process. In addition, we are also in the early stages of developing other exciting menu items that we will validate using our stage-gate that will bring news and new customers to the brand. To conclude, Chipotle is a unique brand committed to fostering a culture that values and champions our diversity, while leveraging the individual talents of all team members to grow our business, elevate our brand and cultivate a better world. Well trained and supported people preparing safe, delicious food and delivering excellent guest experiences are at the heart of our success. A big thank you to all our hard working employees for making this possible. As a result, I'm convinced more than ever that we have the right team, the right culture and the right strategy to allow Chipotle to be a premier growth company for many years to come. With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials. Jack Hartung : Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to report solid second quarter results, with sales growing 38.7% year-over-year to $1.9 billion, as comp sales grew 31.2%. Restaurant level margin of 24.5% was more than double the 12.2% margin from last year, and represents the highest margin since 2015. And earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $7.46, a significant improvement over last year's adjusted EPS of $0.40. Just like last quarter, the second quarter had unusual expenses related to our 2018 performance share modification related to COVID, restaurant asset impairment and closure costs, legal expenses, as well as transformation costs, which negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.86, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $6.60. Looking ahead to Q3, while uncertainty still exists with the potential impact of the Delta variant, as well as the pace of the economic recovery, if current sales trends continue, we expect our comp to be in the low to mid double-digit range, which implies a nice sequential acceleration in our geometric two-year stack. This is due to the menu price increase we took in early June, which is holding strong so far, as well as in-restaurant sales continuing to recover. Of course, we'll closely monitoring developments regarding the Delta variant and follow all local protocols to ensure the safety of our restaurant teams and our customers. As Brian mentioned, in June, we increased our average hourly rate to $15, and subsequently took a 3.5% to 4% menu price increase to cover the cost in dollar terms. While average restaurant cash flow remains the same, this lowers margin by about 80 basis points, and increases sales by about $100,000 on the annual basis, so the historic margin algorithm we have discussed is not as relevant going forward. However, we maintain our goal of being able to pass-through approximately 40% of incremental sales to restaurant cash flow, which is an important piece of our earnings growth potential. This is critical as we march towards AUVs of $3 million as higher sales will lead to higher margins and cash-on-cash return - restaurant returns should increase well above the low to mid 60% range we are seeing today. Let me now go through the key P&L line items. Food costs were 30.4% in Q2, a decrease of nearly 300 basis points from last year. This was due primarily to leverage for menu price increases, as well as lower beef prices, which were partially offset by higher cost associated with new menu items and avocados. Given the current environment, it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that Q3 is going to be challenged by several industry-wide issue, most notably beef and freight costs, as well as staffing shortages at our suppliers. We anticipate these commodity headwinds will negatively impact the quarter by an additional 60 basis points to 80 basis points, essentially offsetting the benefit of menu price increases. This will result in food cost for Q3 being at or slightly above the percentage we saw in Q2. Over the next few quarters, we'll have greater visibility on how much of this inflation is permanent versus transitory, and we can take the appropriate actions as needed to help offset any lasting impacts. Labor costs for the quarter were 24.5%, a decrease of 370 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven primarily by sales leverage, and to a lesser extent, efficiencies related to digital orders, which were partially offset by higher wages that we saw for just one month during the quarter. We expect labor costs to be in the low 26% range during Q3 to reflect a full quarter of wage increase. Other operating costs for the quarter were 15.2%, a decrease of 400 basis points from last year due primarily to sales leverage and lower promotional expenses. Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 2.4%, a decrease of 260 basis points versus the prior year due to a significant level of free delivery promotions last year. We anticipate marketing expense to be in the mid 2% range in Q3, while the full year 2021 marketing spend is expected to remain about 3% of sales. Overall, other operating costs are expected to be in the mid 15% range for the quarter. G&A for the quarter was $146 million on a GAAP basis, or $119 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $23.5 million for the previously mentioned modifications to our 2018 performance shares, $2.1 million for legal expenses and $1.2 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also includes $92 million in underlying G&A, about $22.5 million related to non-cash stock comp and nearly $4.5 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vesting and stock option exercises. Looking to Q3, we expect our underlying G&A to be around $96 million as we continue to make investments, primarily in technology to support ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will likely be around $25 million in Q3, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance. We also expect to recognize around $4 million related to performance-based bonus expenses and employer taxes associated with shares that vest during the quarter, as well as about $1 million related to our all major conference scheduled for Q1 of next year. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 23.7% on a GAAP basis and 22.4% on a non-GAAP basis. And similar to last quarter, our effective tax rate benefited from option exercises and share vesting at elevated stock prices. For fiscal 2021, we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, so it may vary based on discrete items. Turning now to the balance sheet. We ended Q2 with nearly $1.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments, with no debt, along with the $500 million untapped revolver. During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $145 million of our stock at an average price of $1,408. We had about $208 million remaining on our share authorization as of June 30th, and expect to continue to prioritize using excess free cash flow to repurchase stock. But as I've said before, the best returns we can generate are by investing in more Chipotlanes. And during Q2, we opened 56 new restaurant, with 45 of these including a Chipotlanes. Despite some external challenges, the development team continues to do an excellent job building new restaurant, as well as developing a robust new unit development pipeline. For the full year, we now expect to be at or slightly above our prior 2021 guidance of 200 new restaurant, with more than 70% including a Chipotlane. As of June 30th, we had a total of 244 Chipotlanes, including eight conversion and six relocations, and they continue to enhance access and convenience forecast while demonstrating superior performance. New Chipotlanes are opening with about 20% higher sales compared to the non-Chipotlanes opened during the same time period. Over the trailing 12 months, Chipotlanes restaurant continues to drive about a 15% higher overall digital sales mix compared to non-Chipotlanes, and it's skewed heavily towards order ahead, our highest margin transaction. In the two-year geometric comp, at the 88 Chipotlane restaurants that have been opened more than a year continues to outperform the non-Chipotlane restaurants from the same period. And also it's early days, Chipotlane conversions and relocations, which are both going through the stage-gate process, are yielding encouraging results. We'll continue to learn and refine our approach to judiciously accelerate our Chipotlane portfolio, whether it'd be an older existing restaurant, strategic relocations of existing restaurant or through new restaurant additions. In closing, I want to reiterate how proud and thankful I am to all Chipotle team members for their tireless efforts. They're helping create value every day for our business, our communities, our shareholders and each other, which is taking our amazing brand to new heights. As one strong team unified by our purpose and values, we remain committed to driving our powerful and durable economic model. Needless to say, my optimism for Chipotle's long-term potential has never been higher. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Nicole Miller of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Nicole Miller : Great quarter. Just wanted to ask one question around development with just two parts, please. The first is, how are you getting to at least store or maybe above 200 units? When you started the year, that seemed like it could be a really more of a target. So I'm just wondering like what has changed in the marketplace that's allowing you to get there now. And maybe that's a function of also growing the pipeline for next year if there is anything you can say even qualitatively on that? And then just the second part is around best practices. Like, how are things going outside of the U.S.? How's Canada? I think maybe the first Chipotlane opened. How's Western Europe? I think you're going to suburbs and testing technology. What are some shared best practices? Thank you. Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. Thanks, Nichole. And we obviously were very delighted with our quarter results. To get to your specific question about new unit openings, obviously, we're halfway through the year, so that gives us more confidence in where we're going to end the year. And I think we talked about coming into the year, how we had a really strong pipeline of units that were planned to be open. The team has done a phenomenal job in securing the people capability, to be ready to open the restaurants. They've done a phenomenal job on the supply chain to ensure that we have everything we need to open restaurants, and we've continued to have really great openings. So, the combination of sites lined up, supply chain in place, people capability ready to go, gives us just that much more confidence on how we'll finish out the year to reinforce our guidance around 200 plus new openings. And we continue to build a really robust pipeline going forward that's primarily driven by Chipotlanes, which is also a huge enabler for the business going forward. Your second question about what we seeing in Canada and Europe. Canada continues to perform. And we're really excited about the opportunity to opening more restaurants up there. Obviously, Canada has been a little bit slower on the reopening process, but even despite that they continue to deliver great economics, and frankly, are performing in line with the U.S., and we're very optimistic about how we can continue to open and grow in Canada. In Europe, I think I mentioned this in some of our recent investor meetings. We just opened two new restaurants outside of London, and both of those are off to a really good starts. We're just a couple of weeks in. But we love the diversity of assets that we're opening. We love the fact that we have our digital assets all in place. And I'm optimistic about what we're going to learn. So that we can really give clarity on the opportunity in Europe down the road. But that's still in the early stages of our stage-gate process. And I think I mentioned this in the past, probably COVID has slowed us down in our learning there than anywhere else. But love what we're seeing in the U.S. on new units and it's exciting to see the economics we're getting out of Canada. Operator : The next question comes from Dennis Geiger of UBS. Please go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Brian, just wondering if you could talk a bit more about the digital and the dining businesses? I guess, specifically, the customer overlap there, where you think that overlap is now? I believe, historically, it's been sort of in the 10% to 15% range. And just kind of curious if you have any decent sense on where that might be going, going forward, as dining traffic goes from 70% to 100% and depending on where digital shakes out? Just curious how you think about that dynamic going forward? Thanks. Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So I think we mentioned this in our comments earlier. But we hung on to about 80% of our digital sales and we're seeing about 70% of our dining room sales recaptured of where we were pre COVID. And what we're seeing is the overlap is still in that 15% plus range, people doing both channels, which leaves the door open for a lot of incremental occasions or different occasions. The one thing that is driving some of the bounce back in our dining room business is, we are seeing more business at lunch. And we're also seeing that lunch business occur Monday through Friday. And then when you look at kind of like suburban versus urban, that's another place we're starting to see clearly people return to work or return to normal, I would say, behaviors throughout the day. So, the lunch occasion is definitely coming back, while we're hanging on to all these new occasions around dinner and a lot of these off-premise occasions we've been talking about over time. I'm guessing, we'll continue to see the overlap slowly go up from here, because as more people return to the dining room, I'm hoping they've had really positive experiences digitally that will suggest, hey, want to give Chipotle a try in the dining room and vice versa. Hopefully, people that are dining room only people have heard great things about our rewards program, our digital system, and they'll start giving that a try. But the thing I love about the two business is, they serve different occasions, different needs, and I think that proves over the long run, these things are incremental or complementary. Dennis Geiger : It's very helpful. If I could slip just one more in. Just curious on the pricing increase point. If you could just comment at all on the customer resistance that you saw there, maybe how that stacked up relative to expectations and what that might mean as you think about the next increase? Thank you very much. Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So, obviously, I think we talked about this before, Chipotle has a tremendous value proposition. We always have known - we have some pricing power. It's something we really would prefer to be the last thing we have to use. It made sense for us to take some action, specifically, in the delivery channel and then most recently across our menu. Consistent with the past, we saw very little resistance with the price increase in any of these channels. So, I would say, went as expected, and we'll continue to keep an eye on our value proposition going forward. And I would tell you the good news is I think our value proposition remains very strong. So that if we're faced with any headwinds that warrants the need for pricing, I think we can do it with confidence knowing that the brand is really strong and our value proposition is really strong. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Charles of Cowen. Please go ahead. Brian Vieten : This is actually Brian Vieten on for Andrew. Thanks guys for the question. So, just thinking about long-term margins here, now that we're essentially back to peak AUVs as we look ahead kind of $3 million AUVs and beyond, just - I guess just philosophically what's the right way to think about the restaurant margins you can produce at that level, just given the efforts you guys have done to close the margin gap for delivery sales? Brian Niccol : Well, I'll start, and then Jack feel free to chime in. I think what you're hearing from us is we believe we've got a lot of growth still in front of us from a top line standpoint. And the model of how we flow these incremental dollars is very much strong, and in place to continue to be a leader in the industry on this front. And as I mentioned, we also have pricing power. So, you kind of pair those things up, you realize - look, we're going to do all the right things we can on the supply chain front, being as efficient as possible, investing in the things that matter to our customers and our employees. And then, obviously, I think we'll be rewarded with top line, and then accordingly, we'll figure out how best to flow that to the bottom line. But we love the situation we're in. We believe we're going to continue to drive growth from here. And we're very optimistic about our future. But, Jack, I don't know if you want to comment on anything else as it relates to this question? Jack Hartung : Yes. Listen, the data point that we shared today about when we grow our sales, we expect about 40% flow-through to the margin suggests there is still a lot of leverage as we grow our volumes from $2.5 million up to the $3 million, that our margin is going up. And I would just - in rough terms, I would say, from where we are today in the 24%, 25% range, we can add hundreds of basis points of margin as we move up from $2.5 million up to $3 million. And importantly, when we get into that range, we're going to have cash on cash returns on our restaurants, which today are very attractive at 60%, 65%, they're going to be in the 80%, 90%, even approaching 100% returns. And that's - frankly, internally, that's something we've always looked at. We know that if we generate superior returns on all of our invested capital that we can have lots of shareholder value and we expect that to only get better over time. Operator : The next question comes from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John Glass : First, just going back to pricing, just to level set, where will the effective pricing be in the third quarter, just given the price increase you took in the delivery? I just want to make sure I understand that in the context of your comp guidance. And related to that, Jack, I understand the mechanics of lowering restaurant margin with the increase in the labor. You made it sound like that's just going to be the way it is. But I think previously you've sort of talked about, well, we'll look at pricing over time, so that we can kind of get back to that one-to-one relationship with AUVs and margins. Is that still the goal or do you just think it should be lower because you don't want to get too aggressive on pricing in the near term? Jack Hartung : Yes, John, I mean, listen, there is still that possibility that we could take additional pricing action to fully close the gap. I just think there is so much going on right now with inflation and the question about whether inflation is transitory or permanent. We've got labor inflation. We took a big move there. We'll see how that shakes out. And now we've got the Delta variant as well. There's a lot of unknowns. And so what we don't want to do is sit here and declare that we're going to do something with certainly between now and the end of the year. I think we want to do is, let's see how the menu price continues to be accepted by customers, so far, really, really good, really seeing no resistance whatsoever. Let's see what happens to inflation, and let's see what happens to the economy over the next several months, and we'll make the appropriate decisions at the appropriate time. But I think the important thing, John, is that we've got a lot of upward mobility on our margins. We have pricing power. Now, it's just a matter of how and when we decide to use that pricing power to either protect margins or to invest in our people like we just did with the wages. But nothing has been locked and loaded in terms of what we will do between now and the end of the year. John Glass : And the effective pricing for the third quarter? Jack Hartung : Yes, John, it's - the Q2 was about 9%-ish call it. Q3 will be slightly higher. What happens is, you're going to get the full quarter for the wage menu price increase we just took. We got about a month worth of it in Q2. We'll get a full three months in the third quarter. But then we're also starting to lap the delivery increase that we started taking in the third quarter of last year. So to move from about, call it, a 9%-ish increase or the low-9% to about 10% in Q3. John Glass : And, Brian, just one more. Did the increase in wages solve largely the labor issue? Are you fully staffed in restaurants or you still needing to employ people even with those higher wages? And can you just talk about maybe the tenure of your employees now? I think in the past, tenured employees with great throughput. Maybe there's been more turnover just during COVID. Are you seeing the same kind of performance out of restaurants and throughput that you would hope for given this comp level? Brian Niccol : Yes. So, to answer your first question, the employee value proposition that we're bringing forward with the higher wages, the ability to grow into $100,000 opportunity in very short order has worked very well. And I give a lot of credit to our guys in the field with being out there, recruiting and retaining our talent. And we're in a really good labor spot relative to - as you look at our historical performances, we're back to where we were in 2019, and frankly, a little bit better, which is great to see. And also the growth in our Company is really resonating with our employees. Our General Managers know that they have the ability to become Field Leaders. And our Field Leaders know they have the ability to become Team Directors. And folks that are Shift Managers and Kitchen Managers know there's going to be a lots of General Manager jobs available. So, that's why I say the whole employee value proposition, I think, is really resonating. Combine that with the Company's purpose, and we've made tremendous progress on what was really a difficult situation that popped up in, call it, February and March with the business just frankly coming back faster than we were able to hire. But now our hiring has caught up. To answer your other part of the question, we still have work to do to get our grade throughput model back in place. It's been, gee, well over a year since folks all lines. And for some of our employees it's the first time they're seeing lines, and for customers too. Part of the process of getting people move down the line quickly is they need to know how to order, what they want to order, and getting back to individual meals, as well as our team members being quick to move them down the line, but doing it in an accurate way. So, we still have opportunity on the throughput front. But I think that's just a matter of retraining, building that muscle on our throughput pillars, and I'm confident we're going to capture that opportunity. Our operators are focused on it. Operator : The next question comes from David Tarantino of Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Brian, I'm curious I think - curious to know how you're thinking about the appropriate growth rate for the business going forward? If you think longer term, you have great returns on capital and the units. You have plenty of capital to put to work. So just wondering how you're thinking about unit development in particular and whether you can accelerate over the next few years? And maybe secondarily, whether Chipotle can return to being a 10% type unit growth story at some point in our future? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, I think, here's the good news, David. I think every year since I've been here, we've been able to accelerate new units. And the good news is our operations are stronger. Our people capability, I think, is stronger. The P&L now is stronger. And I think you're seeing our ability to open more units get demonstrated, even in a difficult environment, right. We talked about how we plan on opening over 200 units this year. So, I think there's going to be an opportunity for us to continue to accelerate. The pace at which we do that, we're going to be probably more on the conservative side than putting the pedal to the metal on that one, because I just want to make sure we continue to open with excellence. And I know there is demand. I know the economics are excellent. And I know we have the people capability. I just want to keep doing it in a way where we're able to build upon our success and we have tons of runway in this space. So, optimistic about our ability to accelerate from here. What that ultimately looks like? As we get closer to each year, we'll probably have a better idea of what we can build on. Operator : The next question comes from David Palmer of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Just a quick follow-up. First on the pricing that you did on the delivery side, did you see a shift to mobile order and pickup? And do you think that's related? And if you did, was it related to the pricing at all? Brian Niccol : We saw a little bit of a move into our order ahead business, but it coincided, David, with also kind of everything reopening a lot more. So I don't know how much of that was driven by the pricing versus the fact that the customer was now more mobile, and they clearly saw the trade-off in paying for the convenience of delivery versus ordering ahead and picking up. But we saw very little resistance in our delivery business. So I think it's more to do with people wanting different occasions, and then what they want to pay for those occasions, and the fact that they're are more mobile, than frankly, the pricing driving those behaviors. But, Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything to that? Jack Hartung : No, Brian. I would say the same thing. We're really pleased with the trends. We didn't see anything that was a sudden resistance to the delivery menu price, but because it coincided with people becoming out and about a little bit more, we did see a little shift in that business. So, it's hard to sort through and figure out how much is due to pricing, how much was due to just people looking for the in-store ordering process. But the bottom line is our business moved up. It didn't move backwards, it definitely moved up when you combine all channels. Brian Niccol : Yes. And actually, I think, the only thing I'd add to that, David, is one thing we continue to learn is these occasions are unique. If you want a delivery occasion, you usually don't trade it off with an order ahead occasion. But the ability to have access to both is really powerful. So that's what I think Jack's point is like at the end of day, we saw - we didn't see a step back in our business, we continue to see steps forward. And I think it was more driven by the fact that people were more mobile, and then they realized these additional access points. David Palmer : And just related question about where this on-premise ordering will end up at the end of the day? The consumer has been trained to do digital ordering for you? If you - the on-premise ordering, it feels like it's something like $0.5 million per store lower than it was pre-COVID. And in some ways, you're not missing it because you'd have high margin digital orders, but some of this is probably going to come back because people are still little COVID cautious. You're worker shortages, work from home, and some of those things will burn off. So how do you think about the melt up in that on-premise order business? And how much of it maybe is semi permanently shifted to digital ordering? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, I think - I mean, this is us just reading our consumer data, and granted we're only a couple of weeks really in where things are really been open and all our restaurants have been opened. But what is definitely clear is that on-premise occasion is a different occasion. And I think I mentioned this earlier, we only have about 15%, 17% of people overlapping between the occasions. And when you talk to folks that in-dining room experience - as much as we've replicated the in-line experience online, it's - there is still something to be said to walking down the line, seeing the food, getting the sights, the sound, the smells, and getting probably another level of customization that I think is very engaging to customers, and they want to have that experience. So, I think, our dining rooms are going to keep coming back. And I also think it's human nature, you want to eat out, like you like a change of scenery, people like to share a meal. And I've probably been one of the few that's keep saying dining rooms will come back, and I think if we give a great experience, they'll come back disproportionately to Chipotle. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Carril of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Chris Carril : So, how does the continued recovery of the dining room business factor into how you're thinking about the opportunities across different restaurant types or models with respect to your long-term development plans? And maybe related to that, could you also share any learnings so far from the digital-only restaurant you opened last year? Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. Look, that's why the focus for us is to build Chipotlanes. It give you all the access points, right. You can order ahead, pick it up in your car. You can order ahead, come in and grab and go. You can come through the line. And we're going to be focused on building as many Chipotlanes as possible. As we think about these digital-onlys or Chipotlane-onlys or these alternative formats, they really are - I think, about them as like seeing restaurants or opportunistic to the trade area to maximize Chipotle sales coming out of a trade area. But the focus area for us is Chipotlane. We want all the access modes for our customers. Because at the end of the day, I could keep talking about these are different occasions, arguably, you're almost a different consumer when you decide you want to do digital versus being a dining room customer. So that's what we're after. I think it's what our customers want. And I think it's what maximizes returns for us. Specifically, our digital-only restaurant in the trade area where it made sense to do it is doing really well. But you know what, if the trade area supported putting a Chipotlane, I'll put a Chipotlane in there. Operator : The next question comes from Jared Garber of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jared Garber : Somewhat of a follow-up to the last question and your commentary, Brian. I'm just curious how you guys are thinking about sort of the Chipotlane opportunity over the longer term? Obviously, about 80% of the new units this quarter had a Chipotlane versus I think like sort of the traditional guidance of about 70%. If we think about that opportunity over the next several years, are there dayparts, are there menu innovation items beyond sort of the Quesadilla that you're thinking about that can really only be served with Chipotle in that sort of some sort of critical mass that we should be thinking about over the longer term? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look I definitely think as you get more penetration, the Chipotlane asset, it gives us another opportunity for our operating platform. And the thing I love is we've got a multi-billion dollar digital business that over time is going to have more access, right. So, of course, we're going to figure out how to maximize that, whether that's dayparts, whether that's menu. So, as we get more penetration on these access points for our digital business, they give customers less friction and more convenience, we'll figure out how our operators can best serve it. But the thing I love is the Quesadilla has demonstrated, we can run innovation of our digital business without impacting our dining room business. And I think we are also going to be able to run innovation on our dining room business without impacting our digital business. And our operators have done a great job of using great culinary with single kitchen back there to then service two businesses, whether it's our digital make line business or our front-line business. So that's how I would think about it. Jared Garber : Thanks. And then are there any operational changes you're thinking about as you fully recapture? I know you're - it's about 70% of in-restaurant dining today, obviously, as that continues to increase, if we were to assume that your digital business remains really robust and that's additive business when things sort of fully normalize, you talked about some tech investments that you're making. Are there sort of remodel thoughts about what a sort of a Chipotle of the future might look like as you balance out maybe a very robust in-restaurant experience with the digital side as well? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, the way I would describe it is we're going to be investing in ways to get better throughput executed in both the digital make line and our front line. And we're looking at investments on helping our teams with smarter prep, having the right food available at the right time, better forecasting, better staffing. These are all things that will just allow us, frankly, to provide more burritos and bowls digitally, as well as more burritos and bowls on the front line. So, we're really focused on the fact that we got a lot of capacity in these restaurants. So whatever we can do to invest in our people or our operation to enable them to provide more burritos and bowls per minute is a huge leverage point for us. So that's like - at the highest level, that's how I think about it. I mean there is various things and simple projects that provide certain benefits, but the higher order thing we're after is how do we ultimately end up with just enhanced throughput, both for the digital business and the front-line business and in such a way where we still get no compromise on customization, quality of food and now our digital business accuracy. Operator : The next question comes from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : I guess at this point in the call, I was curious if we could have some color about dine-in, and I guess the relationship between dine-in and off-premise broadly in the markets that have been opened the longest like the Southeast and Texas versus, I guess, the Northeast and West Coast, how much of a difference in kind of customer flow are you seeing kind of '21 versus '19? And are there some, perhaps, leading indicators that we can talk about as all markets, I guess, fully normalize and become the same in 2022? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, I would tell you that I think the most important leading indicator for us is we're starting to see our lunch business come back. And what's great about that lunch business is, it's usually an individual that, frankly, we haven't seen in a while. And while that's occurring, we still have these, what I would call, the group occasions, that back in 2019, Chipotle didn't participate in to the level that we're participating in. We have started our journey of getting into these group occasions, in these off-premise occasions, but COVID really accelerated that. So what I would tell you is probably the best piece of news that I've seen in our data is to see that our lunch business is coming back, because as soon as people are given the opportunity to go back to their behaviors of going into their office, dropping their kids off at school, activities, whatever it may be, they're back to wanting to eat our lunch. And that's an on-premise occasion that we have seen a nice uptick probably. Operator : The next question comes from Nick Setyan of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Nick Setyan : I wanted to go back to the longer-term commentary on margins again. I think you said 40% flow-through, if I take every $100,000 from $2.5 million, I think that implies about 50 bps of margin uptick per $100,000 or so. I guess is that separate from any future price increases? And also, how are you thinking about sort of labor inflation and overall inflation, in general, as we kind of progress from this $2.5 million AUV to $3 million over the next few years? Jack Hartung : Yes. Nick, listen, that 40% flow-through is something that will happen if we don't have anything out of the ordinary happening with inflation, meaning if inflation just settles into a normal cadence and we use some of our pricing power to offset that, we'll have the ability to flow that 40% through. If you have a dislocation for some period of time, that 40% is going to vary. But we know, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, when we know we have pricing power, we're in a position, because we're all company owned and we take a long-term view, we can watch how the inflation unfolds over the next few months, the next few quarters, we can see how much is transitory, how much is going to be permanent, and we can take the right pricing action at the right time. So, we don't have to be in a hurry to do it like some franchise organizations might be - feel a little bit more pressure to do that. But the 40% flow-through that assumes just kind of over a longer period of time as you're moving from this $2.5 million volume up to $3 million that is long is over that period of time, maybe not every quarter, maybe not every year, but over that period of time, we're able to offset inflation with some modest pricing increases, we can have that 40% flow-through. Nick Setyan : And then just on the smoked brisket near term, is the timing on that Q4 or Q3? Brian Niccol : Yes. Go ahead, Jack. Jack Hartung : Yes. That was timing on a menu price increase, yes, we haven't made a decision on... Brian Niccol : No. Jack, he was asking about brisket. Jack Hartung : Oh, okay. Go ahead, Brian. That yours. Brian Niccol : Well, I do love the brisket. Thank you, Jack. The answer is it's been validated in our stage-gate process. We've not nailed down exactly when we'll do it. But it's always nice to have it ready to go. And we'll look at the marketplace, and we'll figure out the best time to do it. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Saleh of BTIG. Please go ahead. Peter Saleh : Brian, just wanted to come back to that conversation on the brisket for a second. I know you're not disclosing an exact time of launch. But can you talk maybe a little bit about how you're positioning in the menu? Is something else coming off to make room for the brisket, or is this going to be purely incremental on the menu? Brian Niccol : Yes. So right now, our plan is it will be a seasonal item. And that's the way we tested it and validated it. So, it's a nice incremental occasion is what we've seen. And I look forward to you everybody getting an opportunity to try it, because it's also delicious. Peter Saleh : And just on the cash balance, I know you guys had indicated about $1.2 billion of cash and investments. I think, Brian, you also indicated, you'll be a little more prudent maybe in development going forward, making sure that you're building the right unit. So, what's the right amount of cash to hold here? I know you guys announced a little bit more on share repo. But any thoughts around maybe returning more of that capital to shareholders through a special dividend or an ongoing dividend anything of that sort? Brian Niccol : Yes. Well, first of all, I don't want you to misconstrue my comments on new units. Our plan is to continue to demonstrate that we have the ability to add more units. We've done it every year. Every year, we accelerated. And I think we're going to still be able to do that. So - and the good news is, we have the cash to do it. And we also know there is no better investment with our cash than to build more Chipotle. So, that's always going to be the first priority. And then, obviously, I think Jack talked about in his remarks earlier our share buyback program that's going to continue to be a part of the puzzle, but there is no plans for dividend. Jack, I don't know if you wanted to add anything? Jack Hartung : No. Listen, I would agree with that. I only thing I would add is that, we are - we've taken during COVID, and as we now look at the Delta variant and there is some uncertainty with that, we've been even more conservative than normal with our balance sheet. But what I think you can expect to see is, as things stabilize, as they become more predictable, we'll be able to return even more value to shareholders through buybacks. But we also have the revolver as well, which gives us a little bit of breathing room. But last year when the pandemic started, it became pretty clear that these were very different time and we needed to make sure that we had enough assets or enough cash in the balance sheet, so we can invest in our people, invest in technology, continue to open up our restaurants, and not give up on any of our long-term strategies. And so we're still retaining a bit of a conservatism with managing our balance sheet. But again, as things become more certain, you can expect to see more buybacks in the future. And again, it will be optimistic. We will take advantage when the price moves down just like we did during this quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Jon Tower of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jon Tower : A lot of them have been answered already. But I guess I'll circle back on the loyalty platform. The 23 million members that you have today, can you talk about maybe how much that represents of the total customer base today? And then, can you quantify how the rewards member uses the brand versus a non-rewards member with respect to frequency, the spend, the mobile ordering platform versus perhaps just picking up at the store using delivery? And can you maybe even tell us how much that percentage - how much of loyalty membership represents as a percentage of total sales? Brian Niccol : So, let me - few different questions there. First of all, the rewards program probably represents about 25% of our customers roughly, is the way to think about it. And the thing that's great about our rewards customers are, they have a higher ticket, they have higher frequency, because usually they are more skewed towards digital, which is consistent with what we see in our digital business. And I do believe as we continue to enhance things like our rewards program, now you can redeem your points for lower denominations and get like chips and guac or a T-shirt or whatever, that's just going to dial-up engagement for people. We didn't change the reward necessary to achieve a burrito, but we did enhance opportunities to engage with the brands at different levels. So, I think that's going to be enticing for more people to join the rewards program. And those that are in, will continue, I think, to incentivize their behavior accordingly. So, I think I've covered all of them. Was that all your questions? Jon Tower : Yes. I think you nailed it. So, thank you. I appreciate it. Brian Niccol : All right, great. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol, Chairman and CEO, for any closing remarks. Brian Niccol : Okay. Yes. Thank you. And thanks everybody for joining us. Obviously, I'd be remiss if I didn't repeat what I said earlier, which is a huge thank you to everybody in our organization, all of our operational leaders and folks in our restaurants. I think they have really demonstrated the power of great people, great leaders, great culture, drives great results. And this quarter is truly a reflection of that without a doubt. The other thing I want to touch on is, obviously, we're very optimistic about Chipotle's long-term growth plans. I think we have the ability to grow units, grow average unit volumes, grow margins, frankly, grow everything you want to grow, and then at the same time, grow our organization. So people have the opportunity to grow with this Company and participate in all this wonderful growth. And that's really what I think is driving the strong employee value proposition that's resulting us being able to staff our restaurants at an effective rate right now. So, very proud of this organization. Very proud of our results. And also very optimistic about the future. So, thank you for joining us. And we're going to get back to cultivating a better world. All right. Thanks, everybody. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. And you may now disconnect.",

Chipotle\u2019s third quarter results highlight strong momentum in our business fueled by a multi-pronged growth strategy and a passionate team that's delighted to see more guests coming back into our restaurants. We continue to retain about 80% of digital sales, but have now recovered nearly 80% of in-restaurant sales. While COVID impacts will likely persist for a few more quarters, we are hopeful that the worst is behind us and society can shortly return to a more normal environment. Personally, I'm thrilled to welcome our restaurant support center leaders back to the office beginning in November, which will allow us to optimize creativity, camaraderie, and effectiveness. Key elements that helped make Chipotle a unique and powerful brand. For the quarter, we reported record quarterly sales of $2 billion representing 21.9% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by 15.1% increase in comparable restaurant sales. Restaurant level margin of 23.5% was 400 basis points higher than the 19.5% we reported last year. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $7.02, representing an increase of 86.7% year-over-year. Digital sales growth of 8.6% year-over-year, representing 42.8% of sales. And we opened 41 new restaurants including 36 with a Chipotle. And I'm pleased to report that Q4 is off to a great start. These results highlight that our key strategies continue to resonate with guests and allow us to win today while we create the future. While we regularly get asked what's next, I believe our current growth drivers have plenty of runways and will be critical to us reaching our longer-term goal of 6,000 restaurants in North America with AUVs above $3,000,000 and improving returns on invested capital. To remind everyone, we're focusing on five key areas. Number 1, opening and running successful restaurants with a strong culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences. Number 2, utilizing a disciplined approach to creativity and innovation. Number 3, leveraging digital capabilities to drive productivity and expand access, convenience, and engagement. Number 4, engaging with customers through our loyalty program to drive transactions and frequency. And last but certainly not least, number 5, making the brand visible, relevant, and loved. Let me now provide a brief update on each of these, starting with operations. Well-trained and supported employees consistently preparing delicious food and delivering excellent guest experiences are at the heart of our success. We're fortunate to have amazing employees at our restaurants who have stayed focused on safety, reliability, and excellent culinary despite the dynamic and challenging environment. I've said it before and I'll say it again. Our people are our greatest asset and I can't thank them enough for all their efforts. We are extremely proud of Chipotle's world-class employee value proposition that includes industry-leading benefits, attractive wages, specialized training and development, access to education, and a transparent pathway to significant career advancement opportunities. We believe these efforts are helping to attract and retain great employees, which is more important than ever given the challenging labor environment we're all experiencing today. Over the past 18 months, we've made operational adjustments to adapt to our constantly changing environment in support of our in restaurant business, as well as our record-breaking digital business. As a result, we've had to allocate labor as needed among the different roles, including the DML and the front line, depending on available staff to accommodate the needs of our customers and our restaurant teams. This flexibility has allowed us to keep our frontline open given our ability to divert orders on the digital lines as needed to overcome periodic staffing challenges. This is part of the normal business balancing that occurs at the discretion of on-site managers and has not had a material impact on our business in the past. This was true pre -pandemic and is more relevant now as dining room volumes recover. The good news is that I believe we're finally getting back to pre -pandemic operations and I couldn't be more excited. We're fortunate to have a dedicated digital make-line and a dedicated dining room serving line. Our frontline represented nearly 60% of our business or $1.1 billion of sales for the quarter. It is big and it is growing. We are committed to ensuring guests on the frontline get the customized meal they want made with real ingredients, excellent culinary, and faster than anywhere else. We still have some work to do, but our goal is to provide exceptional throughput as speed of service is a foundational element of convenience that our guests truly value. Therefore, we are committed to teaching, training, and validating the five pillars of throughput every day during every shift to ensure we meet our high standards and provide a great guest experience. While taking good care of guests is always a top priority, utilizing our stage-gate process to continue innovating is critical to our growth. The great news is that Chipotle is delicious food that you feel good about eating, which creates an emotional connection with our customers and they love to see ongoing innovation from us. As a result, we introduced new menu items on a regular cadence as it helps bring in additional customers, drive frequency with existing users, and gives us an opportunity to create buzz around the brand. Recently, we launched smoked brisket for a limited time across all our U.S. and Canadian restaurants. Our culinary team spent the last 2 years developing the perfect smoked brisket recipe that is unique to our brand and pairs flawlessly with our fresh, real ingredients. This is our third new menu item this year, following on the success of our cilantro lime cauliflower rice and handcrafted quesadilla. Early customer feedback on this entree, which is expected to last through November, has been very positive and we're delighted to see an increase in both check size and transactions. Quesadillas, which we launched as a permanent digital exclusive offering in March, continues to perform well and is also helping attract new customers to Chipotle. By the way, if you haven't had a chance to try the brisket quesadilla, you really are missing out. And we're far from being done. Plant-based Chorizo is currently being tested in a couple of markets. And our talented culinary team is in the early stages of developing other exciting menu items. All that being said, our stage gate process is not limited to new menu innovations. We use it for many parts of the business, including development. As you know, we validated new restaurant expansion in Canada earlier this year. Impressive unit economics with AUVs and margins equal to or above those in the U.S. led us to accelerate development in this market. We've opened one new restaurant in Canada year-to-date and have several more planned before year-end, including our first-ever Chipotlane that's scheduled to open next week. Similarly, we are now in the early stages of using this process to learn, iterate, and eventually validate expansion in Western Europe. COVID slowed our ability to execute several critical initiatives. However, with restrictions easing, we're making nice progress and have implemented some of our digital assets as well as begun to test alternative formats and exploring new trade areas. The recent openings have exceeded expectations. So while we continue to view international expansion as a medium to longer-term opportunity, I remain quite optimistic about its future contribution to the Chipotle story. A more near-term pillar of growth has been our ongoing digital transformation, which is helping Chipotle become a real food focused digital lifestyle brand. During the third quarter, digital sales grew nearly 9% year-over-year to $840 million and represented 43% of sales. We're not surprised to see the mix moderate as the world continues to reopen. However, we're pleased to see our digital sales dollars continued to grow despite lapping tough comparisons. In fact, our year-to-date digital sales of nearly $2.7 billion or just slightly below the $2.8 billion we achieved during all of last year. Digital is proving to be sticky as it's a frictionless and convenient experience that has been aided by continuous technology investments to improve operational execution, innovation, and the customer value proposition. As a result of the pandemic, many new consumers were introduced to Chipotle via digital channels, and are now using us for alternative occasions. The thing I love about having two separate businesses is that they serve different needs that will likely prove to be incremental and complementary over the long run. This is reinforced by the fact that different guests are accessing Chipotle through different channels. Currently about 65% of our guests use in-restaurant as their main excess point. Nearly 20% use digital as their primary channel, and the remaining 15 to 20% use both channels. We're encouraged by this dynamic as it gives us several future opportunities, including the ability to convert more of our in-restaurant guests into higher-frequency digital users. Not only are we pleased with the level of digital sales and overall mix, but we're also delighted to see that our highest margin transaction, digital pickup orders, is gaining traction. This channel represented slightly more than half of digital sales in Q3. As always, we're not being complacent and continue to look for ways to enhance convenience and access through alternate restaurant formats, digital-only menu offerings, and leveraging our large and growing loyalty program. Speaking of the loyalty program, we're excited to have more than 24.5 million members, many of whom are new to the brand. This gives us a large captive audience to engage with and distribute content that promotes our values, as well as motivates our super fans. We continue to leverage our CRM sophistication by focusing a lot more on personalization and using predictive modeling to trigger journeys primarily for new and lapsed customers. These personalized messages are more brand-related as opposed to offers or discounts, which is allowing us to optimize program foundation and economics. All these efforts, along with the use of enhanced analytics are allowing us to consistently attract more visits from loyalty members than non-members. No doubt the loyalty program has moved from a crawl to the walk stage and we still have a lot of room to grow. Offering new ways to engage with Chipotle is essential to the ongoing evolution of our digital business. Our first enhancement was rewards exchange, which provides greater customization and flexibility to redeem rewards and allows guests to earn rewards faster. More recently, we announced extras and exclusive feature that gamifies Chipotle rewards with personalized challenges to earn the extra points and/or collect achievement badges in order to drive engagement. As the program grows, so does our ability to provide sophisticated and relevant communications to our guests, which will ultimately deepen the relationship between members and the brand. We are pleased with our progress to-date, but believe with ongoing investments in further leveraging of data driven insights, we can get even better. Amplifying all the growth initiatives I've mentioned thus far are the collective efforts of the marketing team, which are designed to make Chipotle more visible, more relevant, and more loved. We believe that real food has the power to change the world and using custom creative across a wide variety of media channels that allow us to drive culture, drive difference, and ultimately drive a purchase. For example, we use numerous campaigns to stay relevant via important sporting events such as the basketball championships, where we had a million dollars\u2019 worth of free burritos and our TV advertising. We also utilize social media, including our website to authentically highlight real food for real athletes during the broadcast from Tokyo. And of course, to celebrate the launch of smoked brisket, we offered an exclusive peek to our loyalty members prior to a full launch, supported by a media plan across online, video, digital, and social media platforms, as well as traditional TV spots. All of these helped attract new guests into the Chipotle family, as well as increase frequency of existing users. We're fortunate to have an innovative marketing team that wants to be a leader, not a follower. And our marketing organization is built on a culture of accountability that encourages new ideas, is committed to experimentation, and is ruthless on measuring returns, and isn't afraid to pivot to different opportunities if they don't perform to our high standards. Every day this team is focused on driving sales today, while enhancing our brand for tomorrow. Chipotle is committed to fostering a culture that value and champions our diversity, while leveraging the individual talents of all team members to grow our business, elevate our brand, and cultivate a better world. Our team has proven their ability to be resilient and successfully execute against macro-complexities. Again, a huge thank you to our nearly 95,000 employees for all their efforts. As a result, I believe we are better positioned to drive sustainable, long-term growth than we were before the pandemic, which makes me even more excited about what we can accomplish in the years ahead. With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials. Jack Hartung : Thanks, Brian. And good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to report solid third quarter results with sales growing 21.9% year-over-year to $2 billion as comp sales grew 15.1%. Restaurant level margin of 23.5% expanded 400 basis points over last year. And earnings per share adjusted for unusual items were $7.02, representing 86.7% year-over-year growth. The third quarter had a GAAP tax benefit that I will discuss shortly, which is partially offset by expenses related to a previously disclosed modification to our 2018 performance shares and transformation expenses, which netted to positively impact our earnings per share by $0.16, leaving the GAAP EPS of $7.18. As we look ahead to Q4, there remains uncertainty on several fronts, including COVID -related impacts, as well as inflationary and staffing pressures. But given our strong underlying business momentum, we expect our comp to be in the low to mid double-digits, which is encouraging considering there will be about 200 basis points less in pricing contribution during Q4 versus Q3 as we class some of our delivery menu price increases. And our brisket LTO will be for a partial quarter as compared to the full quarter of carnitas out of last year. Let me now go through the P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Our supply chain team has done an outstanding job navigating the numerous industry-wide disruptions, which led to food cost being 30.3% in Q3, a decrease of 200 basis points from last year. This was due primarily to leverage from menu price increases, which were partially offset by higher costs associated with beef and freight that unfortunately are continuing to worsen. Hard to predict how much of these headwinds will ultimately be temporary versus permanent, but they're likely to persist for the foreseeable future. In addition, Q4 will also include the higher-cost brisket LTO, which collectively will result in our food cost being in the low 31% range for the quarter. Labor costs for the third quarter were 25.8%, an increase of about 40 basis points from last year. This increase was driven by our strategy to increase average nationwide wages to $15 per hour, which is partially offset by menu price increases, sales leverage, and a one-time employee retention credit. Given ongoing elevated wage inflation and greater new unit openings, we expect labor costs to be in the mid 26% range in Q4. Other operating costs for the quarter were 15.1%, a decrease of a 170 basis points from last year due primarily to price and sales leverage. Marketing promo costs for the quarter were 2.4%, about 20 basis points lower than we spent last year. While Q3 tends to be a seasonally lower advertising quarter, the timing of some initiatives also shifted into Q4 this year. As a result, we anticipate marketing expense to be around 4% in Q4 to support smoked brisket and for the latest brand messaging under our Behind the Foil campaign. For the full-year 2021, marketing spend is expected to remain right about 3% of sales. Overall, other operating costs are expected to be in the mid-60% range for the fourth quarter. Looking at overall restaurant margins, we expect Q4 to be in the 20% to 21% range. Our Q4 underlying margin would be around 22% when you normalize marketing spend and remove the temporary headwind from the brisket LTO. And the remaining cost pressure will continue to evaluate and take appropriate actions on menu prices to upset any lasting impacts. Our value proposition remains strong, which we believe gives us a lot of pricing power. Despite these challenges, we remain confident in our ability to drive restaurant level margins higher as our average unit volumes increase.  for the quarter was a $146 million on a GAAP basis for a $137 million on a non-GAAP basis, including $7.6 million for the previously mentioned modification for 2018 performance shares and $1.6 million related to transformation and other expenses. G&A also includes about a $100 million in underlying G&A, about $28 million related non-cash stock compensation, about $8.5 million related to higher performance-based bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vesting and stock option exercises, and roughly $600,000 related to our upcoming All Manager Conference. Looking to Q4, we expect our underlying G&A to be right around $101 million as we continue to make investments primarily in tech to support ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will likely be around $27 million in Q4, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance. We also expect to recognize around $5.5 million related to performance-based bonus expense and employer taxes associated with shares invest during the quarter, as well as about $1.5 million related to our All Manager Conference. Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 14.7% on a GAAP basis, and 19.7% on a non-GAAP basis. Both rate benefited from our option exercises and share vesting at elevated stock prices. In addition, our GAAP tax rate included a return to provision benefit for additional NOL generated on our 2020 federal income tax return, and carry back to prior years. For Q4, we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate to be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items. Our balance sheet remains healthy as we ended Q3 with $1.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments, with no debt along with $500 million untapped revolver. During the quarter we repurchased $99 million of our stock at average price of $1,813 and we expect to continue using excess free cash flow to opportunistically repurchase our stock. However, opening more Chipotle s continues to be the best return we can generate. During Q3, despite a few delays in opening timeline, we opened 41 new restaurants with 36 of these including a Chipotlane. While we're experiencing construction inflationary pressures, subcontractor, labor shortages, critical equipment shortages, and landlord delivery delays, our development team is doing an excellent job opening these new restaurants. In fact, we currently have more than a 110 restaurants under construction. And while timing is somewhat unpredictable, this gives us confidence in ending the year at or slightly above the 200 new restaurants with now more than 75%, including the Chipotlane versus our prior expectation of 70%. Also, the team has done a nice job building a robust new unit pipeline, which we believe will allow us to accelerate openings in 2022. But because of the challenges I just mentioned and how they could impact the timeline, we'll provide 2022 opening guidance during our Q4 call. As of September 30th, we had a total of 284 Chipotlane, including 12 conversions and 8 relocations. They continue to enhance access and convenience for our guests while demonstrating stellar performance. And while it's early days, Chipotlane conversions and relocations are yielding encouraging results. We'll leverage our stage-gate process to learn and refine our strategic approach to accelerating our Chipotlane portfolio. I'd like to close today by thanking all of our Chipotle team members for the exceptional results we're reporting today, as well as their hard work and dedication in helping to sustain our long-term powerful economic model. Maintaining a 40% pass-through on incremental sales as we expand AUVs will lead to higher margin and improving cash-on-cash restaurant returns. You can see why we remain optimistic about our future. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. And the first question will come from Andrew Charles with Cowen. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles : Great. Thanks and, Brian, just to vouch, that brisket quesadilla sure is killer. Jack, you noted the 4Q food and labor challenges. If we think ahead, I think the more important question is that, what is the business capable of achieving at $3 million sales volumes in terms of restaurant margins? Is 27%, 28%, is that still the right level or do you think the industry may for pressures in to some degree the freight challenge that you mentioned, does that make that margin level more aspirational? Thanks. Jack Hartung : Hey, Andrew. Listen, thanks for the question. And no, we still believe that that kind of margin range at 3 million is still very much in play. Listen, it's very much of a labor challenge right now. There's food inflation as we talked about. We don't know how much of this is temporary or transitional versus permanent, but what we do know is we've got what we believe is great value. Our customers continue to appreciate Chipotle. They love the convenience. They loved the value. And so we believe we've got pricing power really better than almost anybody if not everybody in the industry. So we'll be very patient. We're not going to cover inflation that hits in one quarter or another immediately, but we will carefully consider the fourth quarter, what action we will take. You know that it is about this time a year that we do consider what pricing we will take. But we'll be patient and watch and see what happens with inflation, how much stays permanent. But we've got pricing power to ensure those margins are in exactly the range you just talked about, Andrew. Andrew Charles : Got it. And just my other question still on brisket, is the issue of the fact that it's ending a little bit earlier in November versus what you saw  side of last year. Is that just due to supply that just ran out or was that the case all along that November is probably targeted end date? Brian Niccol : We're probably a little bit shorter than we originally planned, but that's just a direct result of the great response from the consumer and the great execution of our operators. We got a great product, people have loved it, and it's driven both incremental transactions and check for us so we're really happy with and I'm guessing we'll probably do brisket again at some point in future. Andrew Charles : We're looking forward to that. Thanks, Brian. Brian Niccol : Yeah. Operator : And the next question will come from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia : Good afternoon. I guess my question, kind of building on brisket; I know you had indicated, Jack that the cost could be up some sequentially. Can you kind of break that out into brisket versus just underlying inflation? And then I'm curious with brisket. I think it's the highest priced protein you've ever had. I mean, what does that taught you about where you can go on the menu? Jack Hartung : Yeah, Sharon, brisket, it's about at 50 basis point impact. And inflation is probably another about a 100 basis point impact and you've got pushes and pulls beyond that so. Brian Niccol : And then, just to your question about the pricing  it just demonstrates the value proposition and the pricing power that we have in our business that I think Jack alluded to earlier. So we're really happy with the value proposition and the strength of our business. In the event we feel like we need to pull that pricing lever, we have the ability to do it. Operator : Thank you. And the next question will come from David Tarantino with Baird. Please, go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi. Good afternoon. A couple of questions. One, I wanted to clarify your fourth-quarter comps guidance. So I guess if I look at the 2-year comps performance you delivered in the third quarter and what you're projecting to the fourth quarter, it does imply a fairly meaningful step-down in that metric. And, Jack, I was just wondering if that's the right way to measure the business or I guess, I know there's differences in comparisons if you look further back, but I guess how are you viewing the 2-year comp metric as a guide post for your business? Jack Hartung : Yeah, David, I think you have to go back further because if you think about it, it was back 2 years ago, so it'd be if you look at a 3-year look now. When we first launched carne asada that was a huge hit. And then we relaunched carne asada and it jumped over the original carne asada result. And now we have brisket that's kind of one on top of both of those years. And so I think a 2-year doesn't take into account the strength and the strong comp we had in the fourth quarter back in 2019. To go back to 2019, the fourth-quarter comp was by far are IR comps. So I think the 2-year doesn't quite look at the whole package. When we look at the underlying trends with the exception, David, of the pricing that rolls off at about 200 basis points related to delivery that we took last year, we think the trends are holding up nicely. David Tarantino : Great. Thank you for that. And then, Brian, I wanted to ask about Europe. Your commentary there sounded fairly optimistic. So you mentioned that you're seeing better-than-expected performance from some of the recent openings, and I'm just wondering if you could elaborate on what changed for the recent openings and what exactly are you testing in the stage gate process. And how long will it be before you make a judgment on whether you have the model right for accelerated expansion? Brian Niccol : Yes. So I would say that the kind of the biggest difference is the first time we opened our restaurants with our digital mainlines as part of the opening and also having the access point of delivery as well. So -- and then we experimented with how big really the seats are. So all the restaurants have a nice dining room but some of the dining rooms are more like the size of our restaurants in New York City versus the size of the dining room you might find in a traditional suburban outlet. And the good news is we're seeing great results in both executions. And it's great to see the power of our digital business with the great customized in restaurant experience that you get. So I would tell you that's been the biggest shift. And then, we've also gone back and put into digital assets and all of our existing restaurants. And we're starting to see that take hold as well. So it's very early. A lot of these restaurants just opened in the last month or weeks, and we're really happy with the way that it started. Hopefully, we can continue to get earnings in an environment over the UK and then, ultimately, France, where COVID is not putting restrictions on the business. So I think you're right in interpreting we're really excited about the results we've seen, but its early days, and we want to make sure it performs ongoing, not just at the opening. David Tarantino : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And the next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein, from Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Two questions as well. Just -- the first one in terms of specific cost outlook, who got lots of attention on the commodity and labor front. Jack, I'm just wondering, maybe you can share what it was maybe in the third quarter in terms of inflation. And more importantly, as you look out, whether it's the fourth quarter or any kind of directional thoughts, I know you mentioned what's transitory, what's permanent, but just your thoughts in terms of what it might be like as we look out into 2022. And then I had one follow-up. Jack Hartung : Jeff, I would say, I mean, we're dealing with the same inflationary environment that all restaurants and really all businesses are dealing with nowadays. Some of it comes from labor and I'm not talking about labor on our P&L now, I'm talking about our supplier labor. Everyone's dealing with the same kind of challenge. Some of it is raw material shortages as well. And so it's very hard to predict. I would say the inflation in the quarter was not that bad. It was mid-single-digit type inflation, but you see the same kind of list that we have seen that there are forecast for some material, not necessarily what we're buying, that are into the double-digit -- sometimes well into the double-digits. Now, we're not really seeing that. I mean, we're seeing isolated spikes, but most of our ingredients are okay. They're all pressured to the upside. And what we want to do is really take a look, be patient, and see how much of this is really because of things like shipping, like things that come in from outside this country. The freight is extra astronomically high. And the ability to get the supply we need a very, very challenging. So we want to see how that normalizes. There's material shortages, not just with our food and paper, but also with our openings as well. Some of that is going to normalize as well. So there's a lot for us to learn. Definitely there's upward pressure. And the thing that I would just tell you is we feel very comfortable that any inflation that is affecting our margins today, we have the ability to offset it. It's just a matter of let's be patient, let's wait and see what holds and what is transitory and we'll make the right moves at the right time but we'll be patient about it. Jeffrey Bernstein : Understood. And then the follow-up was right on that topic. In terms of menu pricing and the thought process in determining the right level, just wondering whether your goal would be to fully protect the margin, obviously removing the transitory. But if you felt like they were more permanent pressures, is the goal to fully protect the margin or do you think about more of the long-term traffic trends and maybe don't necessarily take the full pricing that you could otherwise potentially do. I'm just wondering, what's that thought process like? Maybe you've learned something with delivery; I know you took a very large increase there, wondering whether you're seeing the desired results of consumers shifting to more the Chipotle site or any learning\u2019s from that that you could apply to broader pricing decisions? Thanks. Jack Hartung : Yeah. Jeff, it's a great question. And I would say that our ultimate goal, so this would be over the long term, maybe the medium-term is to fully protect our margins. We have great value. When you look at our pricing versus other restaurant companies for the quality of the food, the quantity of the food, and the quality and convenience of the experience, we offer great value. So we believe we have room to fully protect the margin, but we're not going to do it quarter-by-quarter. So we're not going to worry about pressure out a particular quarter on the margins. We're going to watch it for a few quarters and see what happens. But ultimately, our expectation, I think it gets back to the first question about when we get to $3 million volumes, do we expect the margin to be that same kind of 27%, 28%? We absolutely do. Brian Niccol : The only thing I would add to that is along those lines, the good news for us is we still have tremendous growth. We still have a lot of work that I think can always be ongoing to drive more efficiency and cost out of the business. And then on top of that, we got this great value proposition that allows us to take advantage of pricing once we understand the combination of growth, cost efficiencies, and then our value proposition. So that's why you're hearing Jack say he's very confident in our ability to, at the end of the day, capture the full margin and earnings possibility out of our business as we grow beyond $3 million averaging of volumes. Jeffrey Bernstein : But that 17% increase it took on delivery that you mentioned last quarter. I mean, I'm assuming something of that magnitude is having an impact in terms of shifting consumer preference or not necessarily? Jack Hartung : Well, first of all, I would just clarify. We didn't take it all at one time. We took about 7 last August. We moved that up to 13% in the fourth quarter and then we moved it up to 17%. So it was done in stages, Jeff, so we could see what the consumer response was. And we just didn't see that much movement. You see a little bit of movement. We did see order had moved up a little bit, but we were pleased with the way that our consumers responded. And we felt strongly all along that that channel, it's a high convenience channel with a high cost and that channel really to bear those costs and we're really happy with the way it ended up. Jeffrey Bernstein : Thank you. Operator : And the next question is from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. Just a quick follow-up on the price elasticity on delivery particularly, what do you think that was? What do you think the volume trade-off was? Jack Hartung : I don't know that there was one that I can measure that accurately David, because we did see delivery ease, but we also saw dining rooms open up as well during those periods. We didn't see much of any resistance back in the third quarter of last year when we took the 7%, when we took out 13%; COVID was starting to worsen as we moved into the holidays. So there is so much noise going on. It's hard to say we lost a specific amount of sales in delivery. So we saw some softness there, but there are other things going on as well. And then of course, our latest price action that was happening when the economy and restaurants were opening up again. But when we look at the net-net at the whole picture of what our overall sales were and then between channels, we're really pleased with the overall sales trends and we're happy with the way the channels have shifted to the point where that shifting is moving back into our highest margin order ahead and our second highest margin come into the restaurant and order. So the way we've ended up throughout the whole last year, as we took these actions, we think we ended up in a really good spot. David Palmer : Yeah, I was going to ask about that mobile order and pick up. It's got very high incremental margins. I would imagine the advantage and because of labor efficiency would be quite large right now and growing because of the cost of labor. How -- It looks like mobile order and pick up mix may be moderated a little bit. Could you talk about that mix and if there\u2019s any plan that you have, you think levers that you can pull with the database that you have to encourage that behavior and possibly help your margins? Thanks. Brian Niccol : Yeah, luckily, the order ahead, business continues to make nice progress. And obviously, as we open more and more Chipotlanes, we see that business get even bigger. And you're right, David, the efficiency of that order or that transaction is the best margin transaction in our business. So we love opening more Chipotlanes. Our marketing team, our digital team, they continue to drive customers to that access point because it's highly convenient. I think actually I just saw some numbers on this where the time from your order to actually your food being ready is now less than 10 minutes in our business. So we've gotten even faster at this space to make it even more convenient. And just to give your perspective, a couple of quarters ago that was in the 12 minute range. So we're getting better and as we continue to provide I think more convenience, more speed, and get more Chipotlanes, you're going to continue to see that occasion continue to grow, and I think it's great for the business and it's great for our customers. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Nicole Miller : Thank you. Good afternoon. I want to ask a little bit about labor and how you're getting informed there. You're obviously ahead of the curve on benefits. But just thinking about some of the decisions you have to make. Let's say, is it digital make line or digital closes? What are you learning about the labor pool? When will you decide if some of those pressures are transitory or not? And if they're not, what would you do? Do wages go up? Do you have to overstaff to account for not enough bodies? Or is it just simply so much demands? Brian Niccol : Yes. Well, so the approach we are taking is we're doing this team by team. So it's a restaurant by restaurant approach and we're fortunate that we've got great leadership throughout our organization. So when you go into a restaurant that is struggling with staffing, we seek out to understand why? Do we have the right leader? Do we have the right culture? Once we understand that, we make sure we've got the right wages, the right benefits, and people understand the true career opportunity to grow at Chipotle. And what we find is -- look, once they -- we know we got the right leader and people get recruited into a great culture. They understand the career growth opportunity. We do a really good job than winning that hiring competition. And then you'll obviously, in each of these markets, we have to make sure that our wages continue to be competitive. And again, this is another opportunity that I think is unique to Chipotle that we've got the ability to move if we need to on a restaurant by restaurant basis and put ourselves always on a strong footing. So we never want to find ourselves falling behind. We always want to be leading when it comes to attracting and retaining the best people. And that's our approach. It's a simple approach. We want the best people, we want to reward it correctly, and then we want them to develop so that they can grow with us. Nicole Miller : Thank you for that. And then I think I actually lost track of price. I think it was 10% in the quarter, but if it's going to be like 200 basis points lower, I either had too much rolling off or maybe some more came on. So could you talk about price? Maybe a little bit of color by month in 3Q and in 4Q? Thanks. Jack Hartung : Yeah. I mean, I'll do it by quarter Nicole, but it's -- it didn't change that much by month either. There's roughly about 10% in Q3, that's going to drop to about 7.5% or so in Q4. And just to remind you guys of the component, 10 sound like a lot. It's the 4% that we took in June to support the higher wages. It's roughly 2.5% related to delivering, that's way to base on our delivery business. There is our national pricing that we took last year that's 2 or a little bit more than 2. And then there's a final piece in this line, which we took some beef back from last year or early this year, when beef prices started to spike. Now beef spiked again so we're behind on that as well. So those are the components. I only break it out that way because all the action we have taken has been much targeted, very specific, and very, very purpose driven. And then we will move down to a -- that 7.5 in the fourth quarter because the -- a good part of the delivery pricing that we took in the third and fourth quarter of 2020 completely rolls off into the end of the fourth quarter. Nicole Miller : Thank you for that. Appreciate it. Operator : And the next question will be from Lauren Silverman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Lauren Silverman : Thanks for the question. On loyalty, can you share any metrics on how customers spend, or frequency changes once customers joined the rewards program? And then I know early, but anything you can share on what you're seeing with Chipotle exchange and extras, and which cohorts you're seeing the greatest responses from? Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So what we have demonstrated over time is people that are in our rewards program or our loyalty program, they come more often and they spend more. And what we've definitely seen as the rewards program has also, I think, created another level of engagement where those that before weren't participating, now are being influenced with the opportunity of these different incentives, right? Where, I don't know if you are enrolled in our program, but you'll see something like a streak, where you come X number of times, you get a bonus points. The thing that's attractive about that is not everybody wants to wait to redeem for a full-size entree. And this opens the door for them to redeem faster, rewarded for taking action. As we see people continue to engage in the rewards program. So it continues to work really well. Just take advantage of new users, medium users or heavy users that want to engage with the brand. And then we were able to influence their behaviors resulting in more frequency and higher ticket. Lauren Silverman : Thanks. I'm definitely enrolled in the program. One of the best. On staffing, where are you seeing the greatest challenges? Do you see it more in recruiting new staff or retention and any differences that you can call out in the labor environment across markets? Brian Niccol : Yeah. So I would say it kind of ebbs and flows. This is unfortunately the cycle when the restaurant gets understaffed, becomes a much harder job for the individuals that are working there. So we work aggressively to go recruit, train, so that we do retain those that are with us. And I would say the greatest challenge has been when the dining rooms reopened, we needed to staff up quickly to catch up with the demand and that was harder than we had hoped. But luckily, I think we took a lot of right actions where we've got a lot of our restaurants now in goods footing, And now we have these scenarios where things pop up and you have to deal with it accordingly, whether it's exclusions as it relates to COVID or kids going back-to-school. You're in kind of the normal course of having to make sure that you're always recruiting. And then we got to make sure we're getting people trained up, they're being successful in their job, and then they stay with us. And then ultimately, they're able to hopefully get a general manager job and progress into our organization to above-store leadership as well. So our focus has been on making sure that we're getting these restaurants staffed and trained correctly because that's the best remedy for retention. Lauren Silverman : Thank you, guys. Operator : And the next question is from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Please, go ahead. Chris O\u2019cull: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. My question relates to Chipotlane. I was hoping you could provide some color on the average volumes, margin, and investment in that format versus the traditional format. And my second question is that given the Chipotlane format really unlocks the use of different real estate sites, how much does the format increase the domestic unit potential of the brand? Jack Hartung : Yeah. Listen, I'll start with the -- their performance. The Chipotlanes typically open up somewhere in that 10% to 15% range higher on sales. Their margin, obviously, it's higher for two reasons. One, because the sales are higher and we know that our higher volume restaurants flow through a higher-margin and then there's also the efficiency that we talked about where much more of the digital business. First of all, the digital business is usually 10% to 15% higher. So if we're doing 45% so say in a non - Chipotlane, we'd be doing 55 or higher in a Chipotlane, and it skews towards order-ahead our highest margin transaction, so the return is much, much better. The incremental investment costs generally is going to be about 75,000, 85,000, something like that. So with those kinds of sales and those kinds of higher margins it's by far a superior return. In terms of Chipotlane, the Chipotlane in the typical restaurant that you'll see open up, it's not any smaller than a typical restaurant, so it doesn't take a different footprint. What we are experimenting with though, is a smaller footprint with the Chipotlane, where we might be able to go into a same location. The same location would be where you've got two restaurants already, They could be very, very high volume restaurants and there just isn't really enough room to economically put a third restaurant in between those 2. Well, if you can reduce the footprint, which reduces the rent, reducing the investment costs. And because we have higher margins with Chipotlane and because customers, more than 50% of them want to go through the Chipotlane order had they picked up. Well, it's mostly digital and almost half of that is order ahead and pick up. We do have an opportunity economically to drop in a restaurant in between those 2 high-volume restaurant. We're in the early days of that. We're just experimenting with that, but we think that that's got some legs going forward, and that, Chris, would be incremental. Those will be deals that we wouldn't have done without the Chipotlane format. Chris O\u2019cull: Just as one follow-up, I know digital-only Chipotlane s are still in the testing phase, but does that format potentially allow you to have a much broader menu with items more -- maybe more difficult to execute than you could in a traditional format? Brian Niccol : I mean, it definitely allows for some additional innovation on the menu as evidenced by our quesadilla. So that's something that I think our culinary team and our marketing team continue to take a look at. Regardless though, you want to -- the one of thing that's great about Chipotle is people can get the customization that they want and also that we can provide it at a really exciting speed. And so, we have to be careful that we don't create complexity that slows us down even in the digital channel, which look, the digital channel gives us some additional flexibility. But I love the fact that we're now closing in on people being able to order off-premise, have their food ready to be there in less than 10 minutes. That's really exciting for us. So we're going to keep an eye on the throughput for digital, just like we keep an eye on the throughput on our frontline. So it definitely opens the door for some things. I just want to make sure you understand that at the end of the day, we still want to have great speed even in our digital business. Chris O\u2019cull: Understood. Thank you. Brian Niccol : Yeah. Operator : And the next question comes from Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jared Garber : Thanks and appreciate all the commentary on top-line growth and margins specifically. I wanted to switch topics a little bit and think about unit growth here. It seems like the unit growth number in the quarter came in a bit lighter than some of the expectations, but you maintained that full-year guide, just wondering if you could comment on the construction in the permitting environment and what you're seeing from that perspective and if there is any risk that some of these new units needs to get pushed out into next year. Jack Hartung : Yeah Jared. I made a few comments in the prepared comments as well, but it's a challenge. It's a challenge in all the areas you just mentioned. It's a labor challenge for our contractors and it's a material challenge, and it's also a permitting challenge. It's one reason why we mentioned that even though we've opened 137 restaurants so far, we've got about 110 or over 100 restaurants are under construction. There's not a risk that we won't get to 200 openings, I don't think there is a risk that we won't get to or beyond 200, but more than a previous year, more than a typical year, there's timing risk in that. And so I think we'll get to that 200 plus. I think it gives you an idea of how robust our pipeline was. Without these timing risks, we would've been well beyond 1,200 -- well, well beyond the 200. For next year, I also mentioned that we've got a very robust pipeline. So the good news here is our pipeline is really, really, really strong. We're doing everything we can to try to work through the timing issues like we're pre -ordering supplies, for example, so that we're not going to run out because we're pre -ordering things. We're doing everything we can to work with our contractors. But if they have short labor or if they have exclusion because people are exposed to COVID, the construction site is going to shut down. Those are things that are just unavoidable. We're navigating as best we can through that. But most important is the pipeline is really, really strong. The quality when we open up these restaurants is really, really good. So it gives us great optimism and the timing issues, we're just going to navigate the best we can. Jared Garber : Thanks. I really appreciate the color there. And then just one more sort of on that. I know you're kind of holding off on giving '22 guidance in terms of unit growth, which you typically do in the third quarter, but fully understand the volatile environment there. If you were to think about sort of a normalized environment without some of these timing issues, and especially as it relates to kind of the very healthy cash balance you have. Is there any reason that outside of, again, COVID -specific or supply chain impacts; we shouldn't be starting to think about accelerating levels of unit growth in '22 and maybe even '23 and beyond? Jack Hartung : Yeah, listen; our pipeline will support that acceleration. So then it really does come down to timing. And it's not just about the capital. I mean, just because we have the capital doesn't mean we'll accelerate pace. It's a combination of good sites are available, the openings are strong. We're getting now up to 75% of our new openings are Chipotlane, which you heard us talk about the performance there, so there's every reason to continue to invest in the success. And so you definitely will see some acceleration. Jared Garber : Awesome. Thanks so much. Operator : And the next question is from John Tower from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. John Tower : Awesome. Thanks for taking the questions. I've got a few. So just a clarification first on the fourth quarter same-store sales guidance. Right now, are you guys trending towards the higher end of that range given you're expecting some mix shift lower as well as some pricing rolling off? Jack Hartung : Yeah. October results are good so far. So we didn't see a fall-off at all in October. But in terms of the range, there's a lot of uncertainty going on. We still have 2.5 months ago, so I'd hate to want to be more specific at this point. John Tower : Got it. And then just go into the, I think question earlier or some of the labor challenges you alluded to in the press release and on the call, did that impact same-store sales, specifically throughput at all during the quarter? Brian Niccol : I mean, look, obviously a fully staffed restaurant outperforms an understaffed restaurant. One of the things that's terrific for our business though, is the fact that we have most of the digital mainline in the front line, we're able to flex that digital mainline so that we can keep the integrity of our front-line experience. So we never have to close our restaurants. And what we're able to do is then allocate accordingly. The other thing that we've learned that's another benefit of this digital business is we have restaurants within a couple of miles of each other and delivery; it doesn't get impact if you ship from one restaurant to another. So we have to throttle back our digital business in one restaurant because we're a little light on staffing so that we can keep the frontline running smoothly. The good news is we got another restaurant right around the corner that is able to fulfill that digital order. And so we don't see a lot of drop-off in the business that way. But at the end of the day, I wish all our restaurants were fully staffed and I know we're missing sales because not all of the mark will be staffed. So there is still upside in getting our staffing solved in every single restaurant. The good news is we're in really good shape for the majority of our restaurants. Our teams have done a phenomenal job, and it's going to be something that we're going to continue to work hard. And we're -- it's one of those things where it's not going to get any easier. So therefore, we have to continue to get better at recruiting, training, and keeping these restaurants staffed. So we're fortunate that we've got these two businesses and we've got the flexibility, but I wish every restaurant was staffed. It'd be a better job for everybody. And it'd be a better experience for every customer. John Tower : Got it. Thank you. And then just one more follow-up on the pricing decision. Can you walk us through how you're thinking about the fourth quarter, or maybe it's not even in the fourth quarter, but in terms of taking incremental price from here, is it the belief that you're going to see protein inflation well into '22, and therefore, it makes more sense for pricing to be taken now or -- I guess, can you walk us through the thinking around why or why not to take any more pricing sooner rather than later? Brian Niccol : Yeah, I think, the one thing that Jack mentioned is this, we traditionally always look at how we want to approach pricing for the next year in the fourth quarter. One of the things we're obviously evaluating is where is labor going to land, not just in our restaurants but across a lot of our suppliers. We don't see wages as one of those things that are temporary and going backwards. Now, there\u2019s other thing like freight and some of those things where we think those are more temporary. So we're -- we just want to understand what those things are. And the good news is we got a great value proposition so that if we realize we need to take a little more or take a little less, we have the flexibility to do it. And then when you marry that up with all the growth that we have in this business, we don't want to get ahead of the pricing if we don't need to. So we're not afraid to use our value proposition, but I want to use it when we really have to use it. And we've demonstrated that if we need to take pricing, we will and the business has the pricing power to do it. But we want to make sure we're taking pricing because it's stuff that's permanent, not stuff that's temporary. And we also want to think about how we blend that with all the growth and other cost-saving initiatives we've got going on. John Tower : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And the final question today will be from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please, go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thank you. Brian, just wanted to ask a little bit more on some of the key incremental drivers of sales growth over maybe the coming months and quarters. Just curious based on what you've said, if it's kind of fair to think about incremental benefits from a few, I guess, including that dining room of traffic goes from 80% to 100 at some point. digital sales remain incremental in that scenario, obviously, the additional pricing that you just spoke to, I guess stepping up and maybe the efficiency from the cruise just getting better as dining room traffic comes back. Curious if it's fair to think about all of those as incremental from here and then if there's any others that you would call out above and beyond everything that's been working and supporting momentum to date? Thank you. Brian Niccol : Yeah. Sure. So look, I definitely think you've touched on a lot of them, which is we still have opportunities for better throughput on our frontline. I just mentioned that we're continuing to get faster on our digital business. So just running the operation to your point, as we continue to get more fully staffed with more trained, well-developed people executing against the 3 pillars of throughput that we know we need to execute, there is upside in the business there. There is also upside in the strategies that I outlined in the beginning of the conversation today, which is we're going to continue to take advantage of our huge and growing rewards program. We've got -- we're closing in on 25 million, we're at 24.5 million. That's like a 40% increase versus where we were a year ago this time. So obviously, it's not going to continue to grow at that clip, that database. But we are growing is our capability and taking advantage of that database to drive behavior, engagement, commitment to our business. Obviously, we will continue to smartly use menu and culinary innovation. So that's not going to stop. And when you think about our access that we're providing to people, I think our value proposition is going to really shine through going forward. So I just think that's another huge advantage. Even as I look around, I would put our chicken burritos up against a lot of food out there. And when you start to look at where pricing is going and a lot of other menus, our value proposition, I think, looks even more compelling. So I don't know what that's worth, but what I do know is I like being in a position of a really strong value proposition going forward given the environment that I think we're all going to be facing. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Brian Niccol : Yeah. Thank you. And thanks everybody for joining the call and thank you for all the questions. Obviously, very proud of our results for the third quarter and I think it speaks volumes to our strategy, our culture, and our ability to commit ourselves to great execution in a constantly evolving environment. I continue to be very optimistic about our ability to get to $3 million plus AUVs with really, I think, impressive earnings growth behind that. So I'm very confident that we're focused on the right strategies. There's a lot of growth in those strategies. And then I love what our innovation pipeline is looking like, whether it's experimentation in new assets, cost opportunities, international. There's just a lot of growth in our business both in the U.S., from a new unit standpoint as well as average unit volumes. And then as you think about the model that we take outside the U.S. So very proud of the team. A huge thank you to them again. It's been a challenging environment, but I think we're demonstrating the strength of the Chipotle culture, the Chipotle purpose. If you don't have those things, I don't think you get the results that our Company was able to achieve in the most recent quarter. So thank you again for taking the time and we'll talk to you next quarter. Take care. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Brian. Brian Niccol : Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. 2021 was an outstanding year for Chipotle, highlighting the organizational strength and resiliency of our brand. Despite an unprecedented environment, our employees remain passionate about their work, dedicated to delivering excellent guest experiences and aligned with our purpose and values.  Our business is as much about people as it is about food, and I strongly believe that we have the best in the industry. I'm very grateful for our team members' monumental efforts. And together, we accomplished many incredible things and accelerated business momentum, all of which was fueled by our multipronged growth strategy. For the fiscal year, this resulted in sales growing 26% to reach $7.5 billion driven by a 19.3% comp; digital sales of $3.4 billion, which grew 25% versus the prior year; restaurant-level margin expanding 520 basis points year-over-year to reach 22.6%; adjusted diluted EPS of $25.42, representing 137% growth over last year; and we opened 215 new restaurants. I'm also delighted with our fourth quarter performance even with the surge in Omicron cases that began in December. For the quarter, we reported sales of $2 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth, which was fueled by a 15.2% increase in comparable restaurant sales, restaurant-level margin of 20.2%, was 70 basis points higher than the 19.5% we reported last year; earnings per share adjusted for unusual items of $5.58, representing an increase of 60% year-over-year; digital sales growth of nearly 4% year-over-year, representing 42% of sales; and we opened 78 new restaurants, including 67 with the Chipotlane. We're encouraged by the recent performance but really excites us with the longer-term opportunity as we believe our powerful economic model will deliver best-in-class returns while achieving AUVs well beyond $3 million and significantly expanding the number of Chipotle restaurants in North America, which I'll elaborate on shortly. There's no doubt in my mind that our 5 key strategies still have a long runway and are positioning us to win today while we create the future. We've revamped them slightly to reflect this transitioning from our turnaround phase to a sustainable growth base. These now include, number one, running successful restaurants with people, accountable culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; number two, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level; number three, making the brand visible, relevant and love to improve overall guest engagement; number four, amplifying technology and innovation to drive digital growth and productivity at our restaurants and support centers; and number five, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings. Let me provide a brief update on each of these, starting with restaurant operations. The key to happy customers is a wonderful guest experience that provides consistently great-tasting food prepared and served quickly. This hasn't been easy, especially if the number of COVID cases spiked and, at times, impacted our staffing capabilities. But we're fortunate to have amazing employees at our restaurants who have stayed focused on safety, reliability and excellent culinary while adapting seamlessly to the dynamic environment. Their execution, whether it be on new menu introductions or managing the balance between digital and in-restaurant orders, has been exemplary. As always, throughput remains a key focal area and something that we're determined to improve, especially as more guests come back to the front line. The critical success factor is ensuring we have proper staffing, which is currently a challenge for many companies. However, ongoing investments in our people, including competitive starting rates, enhanced benefits, debt-free degrees, development programs and transparent career progression opportunities, are resulting in better employee recruitment and retention as well as allowing us to make progress on labor challenges. But we know there's more work to do, especially to support our future growth. As a result, we are focused on increasing our staffing stability through investing in human capital technology that will enhance our hourly team member experience. Specifically, we are in the process of implementing a new digital scheduling program as well as upgrading our learning management portal. Also, I know we've mentioned this before, but it's worth highlighting again the importance of the GM role. Their leadership is crucial in executing the fundamentals of our business and setting the standard for how we run great restaurants every day. Additionally, our GMs helped grow the brand and the careers of countless team members, many of whom end up being top-performing leaders in our organization. In fact, during 2021, 90% of our restaurant management roles were internal promotions. Overall, we've promoted almost 19,000 team members in 2021. Our goal is to develop and retain diverse talent at every level of the organization and be the employer of choice, a message we will emphasize at our all-manager Conference in March. After all, our employees need to be ready to support the consistent demand our talented marketing team creates by making Chipotle more visible, more relevant and more loved. This is done using different advertising channels, including traditional media, to enhance brand awareness and stay relevant. A wonderful example is our short animated film called A Future Begins, which is a sequel to our award-winning 2011 film Back To The Start, and shines a light on the modern-day challenges the next generation of farmers are facing. While many young farmers value sustainability and ethics in farming like we do, they are struggling with new problems like climate change, technology costs and access to farmland. Launching this film is one of the ways that we are raising awareness of our mission to influence the 2023 farm bill that would facilitate equitable access to up to 1 million acres of land for the next generation of farmers. We also utilized creative social media to successfully drive culture, drive difference and ultimately drive a purchase. We celebrated the 21-year anniversary of Boorito by providing $5 digital orders and serving up $1 million in free Booritos through a virtual Chipotle restaurant on roadblocks. We're the first restaurant brand to create a virtual experience on the interactive roadblocks platform, which resulted in Halloween 2021 having the most digital transactions of all time at Chipotle. This is a great illustration of us reaching consumers in a unique way to build sales today and the brand for tomorrow. Enhancing our marketing efforts is a consistent cadence of 2 to 3 new menu items per year, using a disciplined approach to innovation. Not only do these items help bring new guests into the Chipotle family, but they also drive frequency with existing users and give us another opportunity to highlight the brand. In 2021, we launched cauliflower rice in January, followed that with quesadillas in March and, finally, debuted smoked brisket in September. All of these new items performed very well, driving an increase in both check size and transactions. In 2022, we have already launched plant-based Chorizo for a limited time across our U.S. restaurants. This entree is made using all real fresh ingredients growing on a farm, not in the lab, and proves that you don't have to sacrifice flavor to enjoy a vegan or vegetarian protein. It is off to a terrific start and is helping drive cultural buzz for its health and environmental benefits. And there's more on deck. Pollo Asado, the first menu innovation with chicken in our 28-year history, has been successfully validated as part of our stage-gate process, and our culinary team is in the early stages of developing other exciting menu items. So stay tuned. Another important growth driver that accelerated during the pandemic has been our technology transformation, which is helping Chipotle become a real food-focused digital lifestyle brand. During the fourth quarter, digital sales grew 4% year-over-year to $811 million and represent 42% of sales. We're pleased to see our digital sales dollars continue to grow despite lapping tough comparisons, and our overall digital mix remained steady in what seems like a new normal.  Incredibly, our full year digital sales of $3.4 billion is nearly 3.5x what we did pre-COVID in 2019. Digital has proven to be sticky as it's a frictionless and convenient experience that has been aided by continuous investments, and you will likely see us increasing technology enablement for our restaurants and support centers to amplify innovation, enhance the customer experience and optimize efficiencies to improve operational execution. As a result of this pandemic, many new consumers were introduced to Chipotle via our digital channels and are now using us for alternative and, at times, incremental occasions. Having 2 large and growing businesses that are supported by separate make-lines makes it easy for guests to access Chipotle through different channels and is a key point of differentiation. Currently, about 2/3 of our guests use in-restaurant as their exclusive channel, with the remainder using Chipotle's digital ecosystem to conveniently access our real food. This dynamic gives us several future opportunities, including adding more guests, converting more of our in-restaurant guests into higher frequency digital users and leveraging our expanding loyalty program. We now have more than 26.5 million members in our rewards program, which is a key enabler of our digital flywheel. We're focusing a lot more on personalization by creating journeys, primarily for new and at-risk customers that can influence guest behaviors and ultimately drive more frequency. As the program grows and we gain more experience, we are constantly learning, evolving and optimizing. For example, offering greater customization and flexibility to redeem rewards as well as gamifying the program with personalized challenges and badges that helped drive engagement and deepen relationships with our guests. Not only have we seen strong positive responses from our most loyal fans, but even more exciting is that these program enhancements have increased engagement from our medium and low-frequency guests. We are delighted with our progress to date and believe ongoing investments and further leveraging of data-driven insights will make us even better. Our last strategic driver is to expand access and convenience, which today is the #1 request from consumers. And we're listening. I'm excited to share that over the long term, we now believe we can operate at least 7,000 Chipotle restaurants in North America, up from our prior goal of 6,000 based on the success of small town opportunities that are delivering unit economics at or better than our traditional locations. We're also in the early stages of testing alternative formats, including seam locations, which, if successful, could further expand our addressable market. Additionally, given healthy and improving cash-on-cash returns, we are building a real estate pipeline that will allow us to accelerate new unit growth to be in the range of 8% to 10% per year, with greater than 80% of new restaurants having a Chipotlane. And of course, we continue to look for ways to enhance convenience with Chipotlanes, alternative formats, delivery and catering to provide many ways for our guests to Chipotle. In closing, I can't thank our employees enough for everything they've done to elevate the brand and cultivate a better world for each other, our guests and our communities no matter what external restrictions came our way in 2021. As I've said before, challenges create opportunities, and we are now in a much stronger competitive position than we were 2 years ago. While we're still navigating through what we all hope is the last phase of this pandemic, I look forward to the future with optimism and can't wait to see what 2022 holds for Chipotle. Okay. With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials. Jack Hartung : Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. We ended the year on a positive note, with sales in the fourth quarter growing 22% year-over-year to reach $2 billion as comp sales grew 15.2%. Restaurant-level margin of 20.2% expanded 70 basis points over last year. And earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $5.58, representing 60.3% year-over-year growth. The fourth quarter had unusual expenses related to legal expenses, our previously disclosed 2018 performance share modification, transformation costs as well as restaurant asset impairment and closure costs, which negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.89, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $4.69. As we look ahead to 2022, there remains uncertainty on several fronts, including COVID impacts as well as staffing and inflationary pressures that limit our visibility, and therefore, make it difficult to provide full year comp guidance. These headwinds were significant in January, which also included some challenging weather, which led to a January comp of around 5%. We remain optimistic that as these challenges ease that our comps will accelerate from the January level. While it's difficult to predict the comp for Q1 with precision, we expect it to land somewhere in the mid to high single-digit range, assuming the effects of COVID continue to subside. There's no doubt our restaurant-level margin is messy in the near term. So let me provide some perspective on Q4 and what we expect moving forward. Besides ongoing labor pressures, our Q4 margin was impacted by a higher level of commodity inflation than we originally expected, primarily due to elevated beef and freight costs. As a result, we took a 4% menu price increase in the middle of December to help offset these headwinds. Given the timing of this pricing action, it had little impact in the quarter, resulting in our Q4 margin being at the lower end of our 20% to 21% guidance range. However, if you look ahead to Q1 where we will see the pricing benefit for the full quarter, our restaurant level margin is expected to be nearly 22% and normalizing for the elevated marketing spend expected this quarter as well as transitory COVID-related cost pressures, the underlying Q1 margin would be in the low to mid-23% range.  The bottom line is that our underlying margin remains healthy, and we believe we still have pricing power to use as needed if inflation continues to rise going forward. Of course, we'll be thoughtful and patient as we consider these actions to make sure we continue to deliver an excellent value and dining experience to our guests. Now let me go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. While our supply chain team continues to do an admirable job keeping our restaurants and supply key ingredients and managing the cost of doing so, external challenges were quite extreme in Q4, which led to food cost being 31.6%, an increase of 60 basis points from last year. As I just mentioned, inflation on beef and freight and to a lesser extent, avocado costs more than offset the leverage from our menu price increases. As we think about Q1, the successful premium brisket LTO has ended, and we get the full benefit of our December pricing. These tailwinds will be partially offset by a full quarter of elevated beef prices as well as seasonally higher avocado pricing. As a result, we expect our Q1 food cost to be in the 30% to 30.5% range. Labor costs for the fourth quarter were 26.4%, an increase of about 100 basis points from last year. This increase was driven by our strategic decision to increase average nationwide wages to $15 per hour in May of last year, which was partially offset by menu price increases and sales leverage. While we're expecting elevated wage inflation to continue, especially given higher exclusion and overtime pay because of the Omicron variant, our December menu price increase should provide some offset resulting in labor costs being in the low 26% range for Q1.  Other operating costs for the quarter were 16.3%, a decrease of about 160 basis points from last year, due primarily to price and sales leverage. Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 3.6%, about 30 basis points lower than we spent last year, but as expected, 120 basis point sequential increase from Q3 to support smoke brisket and the latest brand messaging under our Behind The Foil campaign. Like Q4, Q1 tends to be a higher marketing quarter to support new menu items like plant-based Chorizo. Therefore, we expect marketing to be in the high 3% range in Q1 but to remain around 3% for the full year. Overall, other operating costs are expected to be in the mid-16% range for the first quarter. G&A for the quarter was $116 million on a GAAP basis or $133 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $18 million related to the proposed settlement of legal matters, $7.6 million for the previously disclosed modification to our 2018 performance shares and $1.3 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also includes about $100 million in underlying G&A, $30 million related to noncash stock compensation, $1.8 million related to higher performance-based bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vesting and stock option exercises, and roughly $1.4 million related to our upcoming all-manager conference. We expect our underlying G&A to be around $101 million in Q1 and grow slightly every quarter thereafter as we continue to make investments, primarily in technology and people to support ongoing growth. Despite the elevated spend, our goal remains to deliver leverage on this line item relative to our sales growth, just like we did in 2021. We anticipate stock comp will be likely around $30 million in Q1, although this amount could move up or down based on our performance and subject to the 2022 grants, which are issued in Q1. We also expect to recognize around $4 million related to employer taxes associated with shares that vested during the quarter as well as about $17 million related to our all-manager conference. Our effective tax rate for Q4 was 20.3% on a GAAP basis and 18.7% on a non-GAAP basis. Both rates benefited from option exercises and share vesting at elevated stock prices. In addition, our GAAP tax rate included a benefit for the write-off of uncertain tax position reserves in the fourth quarter of 2021. For fiscal 2022, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items. Our balance sheet remains healthy as we ended the year with $1.4 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments, with no debt, along with the $500 million untapped revolver. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $169 million of our stock in average price of $1,750. And we continue to -- we expect to continue using excess free cash flow to opportunistically repurchase our stock. We're privileged to have the financial strength with which to make ongoing strategic investments, including restaurant design and real estate development growth. I'm really impressed by the hard work of our development and operations team as they opened 78 new restaurants in the fourth quarter with 67, including a Chipotlane. This is despite all the construction inflationary pressures, subcontractor labor issues, critical equipment shortages and landlord delivery delays. For the full year, we exceeded our guidance and opened 250 new restaurants with 81% or 174, including a Chipotlane. We ended 2021 with 355 Chipotlanes, including 16 conversions and 11 relocation. And overall, these formats continue to demonstrate a stellar performance.  Furthermore, we're gaining more confidence in our conversion and relocation strategy, which will allow us to enhance the Chipotlane opportunity and provide more access and convenience for our guests. As a result, we expect to open between 235 and 250 restaurants in 2022 with more than 80%, including a Chipotlane. And this guidance includes 5 to 10 relocations to add a Chipotlane. Looking past the pandemic, we expect to be able to accelerate openings in 2023 and beyond and move towards the high end of the 8% to 10% openings range that Brian mentioned. Let me end by expressing my gratitude to our nearly 100,000 team members in the restaurants and in the support centers for overcoming countless issues in the past year to safely serve and delight our guests. Their focus and strong execution have brought us to where we are today and I believe will be critical to sustaining our industry leadership in the future. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Dennis Geiger : Wanted to focus a little bit more on the margin. I guess both for kind of the 1Q, I think Jack and Brian, you talked to, I think a low to mid-23 sort of underlying. Wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about what goes into that. And just kind of the go forward, if you could kind of give any kind of color as we go through the year, what that margin trajectory looks like and related -- as it relates to that long-term algorithm you provided, if there's any change there or if it's kind of consistent with what you've messaged prior. Brian Niccol : Yes. So I'll start, Jack. To answer your question, the long-term algorithm, we still believe we will achieve it. And it's a combination of the sales growth and, obviously, pricing where we need to, when we need to. And then we've got a lot of initiatives going on, make sure that we're as efficient as possible. So long term, we've got 100% confidence in what we can achieve. To your specific question about some of the stuff happening in the short term, I'll turn that over to Jack. Jack Hartung : Yes. The key things that are happening as you move from Q4 to Q1, our -- the menu price increase we took, we only -- we got like less than 100 basis points of impact in the fourth quarter as we took that in December. We'll get the full benefit of that in Q1. That's going to be offset somewhat by the fact that beef inflation has continued. We keep thinking that beef is going to level off and then go down. It just hasn't happened yet. And so while we got a partial quarter of beef inflation during the fourth quarter, we'll get a full quarter of inflation during that month. So we're just -- mainly those 2 things alone and then brisket -- actually brisket does -- it's a premium priced item, but it also is a premium cost item. So that has a drag on the margin as well. And so that ended during the fourth quarter. So when you look at what our margin is expected to be in Q1 without considering timing adjustments, it's in that kind of high 22% range. But we're going to spend more than average on marketing because we're going to support -- we already have supported new menu items. We're going to support our next campaign. And so when you adjust for the timing of that and some other timing differences, that's where our normalized underlying margin should be in that kind of 23% range. And then the other thing I would just add is typically, our winter months are not our high-margin months. So it, of course, depends on what happens with inflation throughout the year. But if inflation doesn't get too much worse, we would hope that we would see margins at or above that 23% range going forward. Operator : The next question will be from Jared Garber from Goldman Sachs. Jared Garber : I wanted to ask about menu innovation. And 2021 was a year in which you had several really successful innovation come through the menu. I wanted to just get a sense of how you're thinking about that as we approach '22 or head into -- further into '22 and how you think about lapping and maybe what those -- where you're focused on the menu? Brian Niccol : Yes. Sure. Yes. Well, you touched on the first part. We're really happy with how all of our initiatives performed. I think it's a testament to our discipline around ensuring what we launch has a high probability of success and -- that we're able to execute, supply it and then deliver a great experience. So really delighted with what we did in '21. As I mentioned this in my earlier remarks, the plant-based chorizo is off to a great start. If you haven't had a chance to try it, I highly recommend to give it a try. It's really terrific. But the way we think about it is we obviously want to listen to what our customers say they would like to see on the menu. That's why we've done things like quesadillas, improved the queso. We want to listen to what habits and trends are happening. So that's why you see us do things like leading with cauliflower rice, plant-based chorizo. And then we're going to lead consumer pallets. And that's why we're really excited about this Pollo Asado program that we just tested. Obviously, Carne Asada was something that we're really excited about. And hopefully, you had a chance to try the brisket. That was just, I thought, outstanding. And so we're going to continue to probably do 2 to 3 innovations a year. We're going to use kind of those guardrails, is where our culinary team is looking. And then we're going to continue to use our disciplined approach so that we have a pretty good idea of how it's going to perform when we do roll it out nationally. Operator : The next question will be from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. David Palmer : Question on pricing. Is the current year-over-year run rate 12% after that latest increment? And what's going to dictate your pricing strategy through the year? And in particular, I know people are curious about how you view your pricing power. What informs your view about Chipotle's pricing power? And basically, how does that dovetail with your pricing strategy? Brian Niccol : Yes. So David, I think we're more in the 10% range right now as you look at Q1. And if we were to take any more pricing for the balance of the year, that ultimately ends up being about a 6% or more -- probably a little bit more than 6% for the year. To answer your question on when and why we would take pricing, Jack can touch on this. Like, we continue to see pressure on wages. We want to make sure that we continue to be competitive on that front. We feel like we're in a really good position right now. As a result, our restaurants are staffed better than they were pre-COVID and, frankly, better than they have been for the last 2 years through this whole COVID period. So we don't want to slip on our wages. So we're going to keep a close eye on that. And then obviously, we'll look for any inefficiencies to help mitigate that, but we do have the pricing lever there. And then as Jack mentioned, beef and freight and some of these other things that continue to stay elevated. We don't see it abate. We'll have to take some additional pricing there. So it's really the last thing we want to do, but we're fortunate that we can pull it. And we see no resistance to date with the levels that we're currently at. And I think I mentioned this in my earlier remarks or maybe this was in the interview I did earlier. I mean, keep in mind, when we talk about these percentages, I'd like to run people the absolute dollar. The chicken Boorito for most parts of the country is still less than $8. Chicken bowl is still less than $8. And that's phenomenal value, especially when I see where, frankly, food that I would question the caliber not being what our caliber is, nor what the customization is right in that price point, if not higher. So we've got a lot of pricing power. Our customers appreciate the brand, appreciate the culinary. And we're fortunate to be in that position. Operator : And the next question will be from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Peter Saleh : Brian, I think you just touched on this a little bit, but I'm hoping you can elaborate a little bit. You guys just took another price increase, and you're running with about 10%, but what about the value proposition? And how do you ensure you just don't outprice some of your consumers? Is there a benchmark that you're looking at to price against? Or is there something else we can look at to get a sense on how much inflation you guys are willing to take on? Brian Niccol : Yes. So look, we do a couple of things. One, we have internal work where we're constantly evaluating the value strength of our brand through, call it, traditional market research. And we also do the analytical side of things, where after we take pricing, we really do analyze what happens to transactions. And the good news is we have so much data now with our loyalty database that we're able to understand are there any behavioral impacts from what we're seeing. And we see very little resistance there.  And then obviously, we look out into the marketplace. You look at -- and all this stuff, right, pricing usually has something to do with your relative options. And when you look at the options, again, this is why I think we get such strong value scores to get our food with our customization, with our access, and frankly, the quantity that you're also able to get. We're kind of in our own space, and we're very fortunate to be in that space. And there's a lot of headroom from what we can tell. And I really hope we never have to use all of it, but we'll be judicious, and when we need to, we will. Operator : And the next question is from David Tarantino from Baird. David Tarantino : My question is about the unit growth outlook accelerating. I guess first question is just wanted to gauge your confidence level in being able to ramp up to those types of numbers in the current labor environment we're in given how tight the labor market has become. I guess is there certain things you're doing on the staffing side ahead of that acceleration that are worth talking about? And then the second question related to this is, Jack, I was wondering if you could give us an update on what the return profile looks like for the Chipotlanes that you're developing? Brian Niccol : So yes. So David, your first question, we continue to feel really good about, one, the performance of our restaurant openings, right? So we opened 215, and the performance was excellent. That's a testament to our real estate development team, our operators to ensure those restaurants were staffed for the opening. And one of the things -- I think I mentioned this in the script. We promoted something like 19,000 people to the manager level. And the one thing that's great about our company is as we close in on having 3,000 restaurants and 4,000 restaurants, our goal is to internally develop our future of leaders. And the reason why that's important is it's a lot easier to prepare for 300 openings when you're working off of the base of 3,000 or 4,000. Or whatever number of openings we want to achieve, the bigger our base is, the more talent we can develop. And I think we're demonstrating we can develop that talent with the fact that we just promoted 19,000 employees. So they'll stay with us. They'll grow with us. They're excited about the growth opportunity. I will tell you, obviously, COVID made it very hard to open 215 restaurants. That wasn't an easy thing. And again, I give it a real hats off to our team for being able to execute that type of new restaurant opening quantity as well as quality. And the last thing I'll say before I hand over to Jack is the pipeline is very strong. And we're fortunate. People want Chipotle in their towns. The landlords want Chipotle in their centers. And we just demonstrated now we also have the small town opportunity to add to the Chipotlane opportunity.  So we're in a really good position. Obviously, I'm hoping we're in the last phase of COVID and some things get a little bit easier versus harder going forward. But it's a real testament to the strength of our operations, the strength of our development team that we're able to open 215 high-quality new units. So Jack, I'll let you talk to David's question on Chipotlanes. Jack Hartung : Yes. David, Chipotlanes continue to outperform our non-Chipotlane restaurants. That's why you've seen us quickly get up to, now 80% of our new restaurants have a Chipotlane. They have higher volume. They skew more towards digital, and that SKU comes from order-ahead, which is a higher margin transaction. And the investment is only modestly higher, call it, in that $75,000 range. So if a non-Chipotlane opening get a cash-on-cash return within a couple of years as the sales grow in that 55% to, call it, 60% return, a Chipotlane is going to generate cash-on-cash returns in the 65% to 70% return. So clearly, exceptional returns. And then what Chipotlane is also allowing us to do is go into the small towns where we have another convenient access point. And then also, we're starting to get into these seam locations. We only have a few open. But with the extra convenience channel at Chipotlane, it just makes it more doable from a financial standpoint and a convenience standpoint to go into these small towns and seam locations that generate superior returns. So yes, Chipotlane continues to perform at exceptional levels. Operator : And the next question will be from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company. Brian Bittner : Can you just update us again on the pace of the loyalty membership trajectory as we enter 2022? Is it still showing a healthy pace of growth? And with this now a very large base of members in this immense digital ecosystem, Brian, what do you believe is the biggest strategic or operational unlock that still sits in front of you as it relates to loyalty that you believe can be incremental to the business moving forward? Brian Niccol : Yes. Sure. So yes, look, we are very fortunate that we continue to grow the loyalty population in a meaningful clip. Obviously, it's not at the same speed it was a year or 2 ago, but it's one of the things that's kind of interesting is we add more restaurants and we get people more access, the loyalty/rewards program becomes even that much more of an appealing program that they want to be a part of. So we continue to see people join. One of the big unlocks for us, frankly, is we still have a lot of people that are only dining room people, and then we have a lot of people that are only digital people. And there's a small group that's doing both. And call it, the 50%, 60% that are dining room-only people, I think if we get those people to have a really positive experience using the rewards program, it's just a tremendous unlock for what that rewards program can grow to be. As you mentioned, there's a lot of incremental opportunity in that. And just within the universe of people that we have, the guys have really, I think, learned quite a bit about how to do these journeys so that they communicate and engage the right way, so that we get the behavior more frequency, or if we see somebody lapsing, we get them to come back into the business. So there's incremental opportunities on just getting all those people that are exclusive dining room people to become at least comfortable with using our digital platform. Even if they don't want to order through it, they can at least take the benefits of it. And then, look, as that database grows, we get smarter in the journeys. We definitely have demonstrated inside here that we can use this tool to influence behavior both in frequency as well as staying with the business. Operator : And the next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen. Andrew Charles : Brian, you were very proactive getting the average wage to $15 an hour back in May of last year, but I was curious about your multiyear view for where wages could go as more national retailers enact formalized programs to get to $17 an hour as you strive to keep Chipotle as an employer of choice. Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, I think wages are going to continue to go up. And I think the combination of having the right wage and the right development or growth opportunity is what gets people excited to be a part of the company. And that's why I think it's really important. That's why I chose to share, look, even in a tough environment, we still promoted 19,000 people, which tells you 2 things. One, they grew with us, and they stayed with us. So we're going to always make sure that we've got the right wage to get people into our company. And then we also want to make sure that we're growing them so that they're excited to stay with our company. And I think your point is a good one. I don't want to fall behind. I like being in the position of people viewing Chipotle as a leader in this space. I think our jobs are great. I think our company is special. And if we can get people to experience that, they have a real opportunity to grow with us and ultimately change their lives and potentially their families. So that's one of the luxuries, I think, we get to have at Chipotle is you can really change people's lives with a career here. Operator : The next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John Glass : I wanted to circle back on the small town opportunity. One, how many are there today? Like, what's the evidence that you have for this incremental opportunity? Years ago, there was something called an A model. So it was like a lower CapEx, good return, but lower volume unit. Are these lower volume but better returns because they're lower CapEx? Or how should we think about both the returns and the volume calculus as we think about the small market opportunity? And just how many there are so far so we can gauge where you are on that? Brian Niccol : Yes. I mean the one thing that is nice is it's definitely a little bit higher margin because the cost of the lease is a little bit lower. And what we're seeing, though, is no trade-off in volume. Actually, it's probably an outsized, call it, revenue or sales. So it's kind of a really great proposition because a little bit cheaper to putting some of the fixed cost, and then people view us as an employer that they want to be a part of. So we have a really good success rate in staffing them. And then the towns are really excited to have a Chipotle. So we see great sales -- opening sales and then sales that stay with us. So look, we feel really good about it. I think there's hundreds of these that we can easily find and build. And Jack, you'll have to correct me here. But I think when we're talking about small town, we're not talking about 5, 10 -- we're talking about like 40,000 plus. So it's still pretty good size. It's small for Chipotle. But I want to make sure we qualify that for you so you realize what we're talking about when we say small town. But Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything to that. Jack Hartung : Yes. And there are some that will be smaller than that, but it might be like on an expressway or something. But I think the key is that these are restaurants that are not in a metropolis. So it's not in the area with large Chipotlane or Chipotles. So they tend to have 0 impact. The margins are higher. The volumes are about the same. So the returns are higher as well. Typically, the construction cost is higher as well. The challenge really is just to make sure that we have a strategic process or strategic approach so that we can keep an eye on these. So a field leader, for example, they have to travel 300 miles to get to a remote small town location. That's very hard to do. But if you string a bunch of small towns together where there's one that's 50 miles away and another that's 50 miles away, you stream these along so that a field leader can, over a number of days, make sure that he gets touches with those restaurants, develops the leadership in those restaurants from a financial standpoint and from a bringing a special dining experience to small towns, it's a home run. Operator : The next question is from Joshua Long with Piper Sandler. Joshua Long : Wanted to see if we could circle back into loyalty and the growing digital base of users that you have. And curious how that's been forming your lifetime value considerations for your customers. I think maybe that dovetails into the -- some of the journeys that you talked about. But curious, if you're able to act on any of that now or how you think about that working into your pipeline going forward? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, it's a high, high priority. We were really excited about the size of the database. And then we're really excited about how much learning we've had over the last couple of years so that we can do exactly what you just talked about. We know when we get people into the rewards, call it, system, the average ticket goes up and the frequency at which they shop with Chipotle goes up. So we're winning share of occasions, and that's ultimately what we're after. I think making access easier, making people aware of that access, really engaging with people in a personalized way, we're able to gain more occasions. And that's really what we use the data to understand. And then the other thing that's powerful, too, and the data is we can see where we maybe aren't executing the experience we want to, and it gives us the opportunity to save what was a less than ideal experience to turn that person from being a lapsed user into an -- coming back to the business and staying with us. So that's really the mission, and we're very fortunate that we've got such a robust data set now, and we've got a really talented team that's, I think, eager to learn every day and build on what we've done to date. We're not going to be complacent, right? We have a real opportunity here to build on the momentum that we have. Operator : The next question is from Brian Vaccaro with Raymond James. Brian Vaccaro : I wanted to circle back on labor, if I could. And with 7 to 8 months under your belt since increasing wages and making the other labor investments, I guess I'm just curious to get your assessment of how effective those changes have been and obviously understanding Omicron's had an impact. But how much of an underlying improvement have you seen in retention application flow or, say, the percentage of stores that are still significantly understaffed? And then if you think needs -- more needs to be done, what form would that likely take? Is it more wage increases? Or is it more than just the money issue in the stores that remain meaningfully understaffed? Brian Niccol : Yes. I mean, look, what I'll tell you is we -- we've made tremendous progress. And even with the Omicron surge, I would tell you we've learned a lot, right, over the last 2 years so that we knew how to go into the markets where we're having a problem. We put a very focused effort on making sure people knew. Those employees that go out on an exclusion, they're coming back. So you're not -- your team is not all of a sudden lost, the folks that went out on exclusion, they're coming back. And by the way, as your business grows, what we call being at model, we are out actively recruiting so that you're going to have staff so that you can perform as this business grows. So I think we've just gotten a lot better at, one, seeing, okay, this restaurant is about to have a real challenge. We put a very focused effort on that restaurant. We ensure we catch the right wage, the right communication of what this job is all about. And I'll tell you what, the one thing that we were probably surprised by, and we weren't leveraging enough initially, is telling people the growth story. Like the number of people that I've met that have joined Chipotle that might have been a multiunit operator at another organization, but they were willing to join our organization as a team member, ultimately maybe a service manager, because they want the opportunity to grow with us, because they felt like they were capped out where they were. And so we've really ramped up that communication. And you'll see that in our marketing materials on what it means to get a job at Chipotle. It's not just the job you're getting now, but you're -- potentially, if you want to stay with us, what you can grow into. So -- but we've made tremendous progress. I think we made the right choice with using the DML as the tool to throttle up and down based on the challenges we were having with staffing. I'm happy to say that's now happening in like less than 2% of our restaurants, which is great. And the reason why it's so low is because our staffing is so much better across the enterprise. So -- but with that said, we're about to move into the season where we sell even more Booritos, and it's going to require even more employees. So we're staying after it. We think we've learned a lot. And we're seeing pretty good yield as a result of our efforts to date. So we love the position we're in. I really hope we don't have another surge. But putting that aside, I love what Scott and Maurice have done to ensure that our restaurants are staffed. Brian Vaccaro : All right. That's great. And I guess I'll circle back on the food cost situation, if I could. And Jack, I think you said you saw beef and freight and a little bit of avocado pressure. But I'm curious to what degree you're seeing inflation on the chicken side, which I believe is your #1 protein? And I know visibility is low, and a lot of things can change on a dime during this environment, it seems. But your best guess or view of the outlook here. Is it reasonable to expect high single-digit inflation for a couple more quarters, perhaps, and then you start to lap some of the increases moving through the second half of '21? Or just curious to get your broad perspective there if it differs from that materially. Jack Hartung : Yes. Listen, I'm glad you said it's really hard to predict the future because this has been the toughest I've seen in terms of predicting the future about availability and about pricing early in my whole career. Having said that, I would say it's going to take at least a few quarters. Like, I wouldn't expect to see much relief. Hopefully, things won't get too much worse over the next few quarters. But we're not expecting to see much of a relief until later in the year. Having said that, you asked about chicken in particular. Chicken, knock on wood, has not been that bad. We've had some near misses during the year. It was more driven by availability of labor and people who had to be excluded because they were -- either they came down with COVID or were with somebody who had COVID. And so there were some near misses in terms of our suppliers maybe being unable to meet our demand. Our supply chain team with Carlos have done a great job of working with suppliers and moving capacity around as needed. And what we've seen over the last several months and what we expect we'll see more of in the future, more pressure on beef, more pressure on freight. Avocados, we think is, -- that's more of seasonal thing, that's more of a cyclical thing. That doesn't feel like a class kind of supply chain issue that we're seeing in this environment. But I wouldn't be surprised if there's going to be another ingredient or 2. There's just been so many disruptions. So hopefully, things will be reasonably normal. We think we've taken the pricing action we need to for what we've seen so far, and then we'll wait and see what happens in the next quarter or 2. Operator : And the next question will be from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : I wanted to get back to the conversation on store level staffing but focusing on the GM. Has there been any change in turnover throughout '21? Has there been any unusual maybe blips in the quit rate that you've noticed? And as you think, obviously, about a growing business going forward, is there anything about training or compensation or the type of person that you're looking for perhaps looking to promote that may change with Chipotle as Chipotle grows as you think about the next era? Brian Niccol : Yes. No. Look, I got to tell you, we're very fortunate with the general managers we have in our company because those guys, through all this, showed up to the restaurants every single day and figured out how to flex with whatever new thing came their way, whether they were people calling off, whether it was people unfortunately coming down with COVID. There was a time period where people didn't really know what COVID was, and these guys and women showed up every day to lead their teams. And we're very fortunate to have that caliber of leader running our restaurants. And we're also very fortunate that because we're a growing company, those leaders are the leaders that then become our field leaders and our team directors and then ultimately our VPs. And they see it.  And one of my favorite things to do in my company is have the opportunity to go visit them in their restaurants. And I'll tell you what, they are so proud of their team. They're so proud of their results, and they're so proud of where we are. So we're working on being better with our learning and training tools. I think we mentioned this in the call, we're rolling that out for them. We're rolling out for them a new labor scheduling tool. And then obviously, we're looking for ways to make the job more efficient, more consistent so that they can continue to do the great work that they do on the culture and the people and the culinary. So we're very fortunate. We've not seen the great resignation that you read about -- or hear about at our company and definitely not at our general manager level. So hopefully, some of them are listening right now because I would brag about them for this whole call, if I could. So thanks for asking the question. Operator : And the next question is from Brian Mullan with Deutsche Bank. Brian Mullan : Just a question on the international development opportunity outside of North America. Can you share what the focus is right now in the existing markets, France, Germany, U.K.? And are you also exploring new markets in Western Europe or even elsewhere at this point in time or just really focused on those existing markets right now? Brian Niccol : Yes. So for right now, we are just focused on those existing markets and really just France and U.K., as you probably have read or know, Germany has been really slow to kind of get out of the COVID challenges. But look, I\u2019m optimistic on what all Western Europe can be. And fortunately, we've had some really good recent openings in both France and the U.K. And I'm optimistic about how we can grow in those countries. And once we feel like we're in a really good spot there, we'll definitely think about how we expand beyond it. So one thing I know for sure is when you look at consumers in other countries, they like our proposition, clean food, Food with Integrity, high levels of customization, culinary happening right in front of you, labors that resonate, chicken, rice and beans, those are pretty globally accepted ingredients. So I'm optimistic about the future. But right now, we're focused on making sure we've got a winning proposition in the markets that we're currently in, and then we'll expand from there accordingly. Operator : The next question is from Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets. ChrisCarril: So can you expand on delivery mix today and how the margins for those orders compare to other channels with the incremental delivery menu pricing you've taken over the past year plus? And how are you thinking about delivery mix and impact to margins from delivery as we move further into '22? Brian Niccol : Yes. Sure. So obviously, delivery, we've got 2 kind of businesses there, right? We've got our in-app delivery business or what we call white label and then, obviously, the third-party partnerships we have with like Uber Eats and DoorDash in marketplace. And you mentioned this, we took some pricing so that the margin issue became less of an issue. And unfortunately -- or I guess the reality is that channel comes with additional cost. If you want that convenience, it comes with some additional costs. And what we've seen is people recognize that and are willing to accept that for those occasions. So our digital business is roughly 42% of the business. Today, delivery is about probably little less than 20%, roughly 20%. And the good news is our order-ahead business continues to grow as we build Chipotlanes and as we continue to, frankly, market against the idea of order-ahead and pick up yourself. So not nearly the margin dilution that delivery used to be but still our best margin transaction as the digital transaction where you order-ahead and pick up. Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything to that. Jack Hartung : No. Brian, you said it [perfect]. Operator : And the next question will come from Andy Barish with Jefferies. Andy Barish : Just wanted to circle back on some of the operational efficiencies, Brian, that you've mentioned a couple of times now, making kind of the team members' jobs a little bit easier or implementing technology. Can you give us an example or 2 of where you're heading down that road? And what -- maybe also what things would be a nonstarter in terms of Chipotle's credo? Brian Niccol : Yes. Sure. So look, we're trying to find -- well, first of all, as I mentioned, right, just getting a better labor scheduling tool that uses artificial intelligence and analytics that doesn't rely on just looking back past 4 weeks but can look at things happening real time so that the team is able to prep accordingly, we should then end up in a scenario where we don't run out of guacamole at the end of the day, right?  And so we're working on technology where just that occurs. How do we help our team members know when to cook more chicken throughout the day, when to make guacamole and how much guacamole to make after lunch because we want to be in the Chipotle business from open to close. Nothing disappoints our teams more than when a customer shows up at 8 :00 or 9 :00 and they're out of something. And so if we can give them tools where they don't have to worry about making too much or not making enough, it just makes their job so much easier. It eliminates one stress. They don't want a disappointed customer. So we're working with that type of technology to help them do just that. And then we're also looking at technology, whether it's robotics, automation, how do we get rid of the jobs people frankly don't love doing, right? Cleaning dishes all day, not a fun job, our job, frankly, wet job. And it's like if we can find ways to eliminate those tasks, right, like we're always going to be cutting and coring avocados. But if there was a way to cut and core the avocados so that all our team number has to do is mash and add the salt, add the lime, add the onions, that would make their job so much better. So it's those types of things. We're not going to walk away from having great culinary. You're always going to see our chicken seasoning on the poncho, all right? That's just one of the sounds and sites of Chipotle and, frankly, the smell that I think makes our experience unique. And then obviously, we're looking for ways to be even more accurate, more timely on the digital make-line. So there's real opportunities there. I think we've got a great system, and I think we can build on what is really been something that's worked really well for us. So that kind of gives you a flavor of the various things we're looking at. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Brian Niccol : All right. Thanks. And thanks, everybody, for all the questions and dialing in. Obviously, very proud of our team, everybody in the restaurants. 2021 was a lot of ups and downs, but I think couldn't be prouder of the results to deliver a comp north of 19%, business now bigger than $7.5 billion, a $3.5 billion digital business. These are all big milestones for our company. We opened over 200 -- we opened 215 restaurants. I mean we're literally achieving new highs in all fronts. Our average unit volumes are well beyond the $2.5 million now.  So obviously, the fourth quarter had some challenges. Inflation is something that we'll continue to deal with. Staffing, we've made tremendous progress on. And as I look at where we are in 2022, I just believe we're positioned to execute the Chipotle business better than we probably have in a while. And it's exciting to be staffed at pre-COVID levels again. It's exciting to see people getting promoted in our organization. And it's exciting to see the customer reward us with their business every day. So again, really, strong position for our company. I think it demonstrates our pricing power, our resilience and the strength of our culture and people. And luckily, we get to celebrate with everybody at our all-manager conference in March and look forward to catching up with everybody next quarter. So thank you for all the questions. And hopefully, you get out there and try the Plant-based Chorizo. All right. Take care, guys. Thank you. Bye. Operator : And thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Adam Rymer, VP of Finance. Please go ahead. Adam Rymer : Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K and our Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from the forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian Niccol : Thanks, Adam, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I share our first quarter results, I want to express my gratitude for the 3,200 outstanding general managers and field leaders that attended our All Managers Conference in Las Vegas last month. It was our first time together in nearly four years, allowing us to celebrate our general managers as well as inspire and learn from one another as we codified our 2022 strategic priorities. It truly was great to be back together again. Chipotle's performance in the first quarter was strong despite challenges from the Omicron variant. For the quarter, sales grew 16% to reach $2 billion driven by a 9% comp, in-store sales grew by 33% over last year, digital represented 42% of sales, restaurant level margin was 20.7%, a decrease of 160 basis points year-over-year, adjusted diluted EPS was $5.70, representing 6.3% growth over last year and we opened 51 new restaurants, including 42 Chipotles. Although our restaurant margins remain bumpy due to inflation, we have the ability to be patient while costs are volatile, and the growth in pricing power to recover our margins over time. And I'm pleased to report that Q2 is also off to a strong start, fueled by Pollo Asado our most popular new protein to date. Our five key strategies continue to position us to win today while we create the future. These include : number one, running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great food with integrity, while delivering an exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; number two, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level; number three, making the brand visible, relevant and love to improve overall guest engagement; number four, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants and support centers; and number five, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings. Let me provide a brief update on each of these strategies, starting with restaurant operations. Our people are our greatest asset and well trained and supported employees preparing delicious food served quickly equates to an excellent guest experience. We are currently focused on improving our throughput as our sales continue to increase throughout the spring, and our in-restaurant business continues to grow. Recently, I was in Denver at our 6th and Broadway location, which opened in March of 2000, and I met two employees who have been with this restaurant since the day it opened, so it's 22 years. They were training our new team members on line, demonstrating how to execute with excellence and speed. It was incredible to see our teach and taste Chipotle value being brought to life. We know throughput, a foundational element of convenience that our guests value is an opportunity for us, and we are committed to teaching, training and validating the five pillars of throughput every day during every shift to ensure we meet our high standards and provide a great guest experience. We have daily goals in place for the number of entr\u00e9es per 15-minute period on the front make-line and promised time execution on the digital make-line. These goals are now included in the restaurant manager and crew bonuses to better drive performance and accountability, and both measures improved during the quarter. We are also in the process of rolling out a new scheduling tool, which will help ensure the right people are in the right positions at the right time. I believe that we are finally getting back to pre-pandemic operations, and I couldn't be more excited. We have been intentional in our recruiting efforts, and we have made investments in our people. We offer a world-class employee value proposition that includes industry-leading benefits attractive wages, specialized training and development, access to education and a transparent pathway to significant career advancement opportunities. We believe these efforts are helping to attract and retain great employees as our staffing levels are better today than they were in late 2019. We are constantly looking for ways to be better at training and development. With that in mind, we have enhanced our training and development programs, recently rolling out an AI-based learning management system, the Spice Up, which offers immersive learning and development opportunities and upskilling for future roles for all employees. We believe our team members of today will be our leaders tomorrow, and we are looking for them to grow with us. Opening 8% to 10% new restaurants per year means we need more crew, more GMs, more field leadership. In fact, team members can advance the restaurateur, the highest general manager position in as little as 3.5 years with average compensation of $100,000, while leading a multi-million dollar growing business. And it doesn't stop there. A GM can become a certified training manager, a field leader, a team director and a regional vice president. In fact, we just recently promoted an individual to regional vice president, who started as a crew member and he's the second one of our regional vice presidents to share this incredible career trajectory. Our marketing team continues to do a tremendous job of keeping Chipotle relevant in culture, driving difference as well as transactions. We continue to leverage both traditional and non-traditional media to increase awareness and amplify the brand. You may have seen our Knowing Tastes Better television campaign, which highlights Chipotle's real ingredients like antibiotic-free chicken, freshly prepared food like our hand-mashed guac and features our real team members. Additionally, we remain a leader in the digital space with our latest Chipotle metaverse experience that launched on National Burrito Day garnering more than 4 million game plays in the first week. From a product innovation standpoint, we generally introduce two to three new menu items per year using a disciplined stage gate approach to innovation. These new product introductions are extremely effective as they bring in additional customers, drive frequency with existing users and increase check while giving us an opportunity to create buzz around the brand. Pollo Asado was our first chicken innovation in 29 years. And the reaction has been outstanding. In addition to adding new variations to our health-oriented lifestyle bowls in January, we also attracted new guests with our plant-based chorizo limited time offering, which proved that you don't have to sacrifice flavor or food with integrity to enjoy a vegan or vegetarian protein. And we're far from being done. We've got an exciting new menu item that will start testing in the coming weeks, which I think guests are going to love. And we have a robust product pipeline for the remainder of 2022 and beyond. A key part of guest engagement is our Chipotle Rewards program, which now has nearly 28 million members. We recently celebrated the three year anniversary of the program by relaunching Guac Mode, an exclusive benefit for Chipotle Rewards members that unlocks access to surprise free guac rewards throughout the year, which resulted in our highest social engagement of all time and loyalty enrollments of 35% week-over-week. We continue to leverage our CRM sophistication by focusing more on personalization and using predictive modeling to trigger journeys that can influence guest behaviors as well as make their experience with Chipotle more relevant for them. This approach uses personalized messaging to learn more about an item, the guest has previously ordered, view their ordering preferences or to see their cumulative real food print, which is a guest potential environmental impact based on their order history. We are constantly learning, evolving, and optimizing to drive more frequency with rewards members. We are pleased with the progress to-date, but believe we will get even better over time. Our ability to share relevant, personalized communications with our guests will ultimately deepen the relationship between reward members and the brand. Our digital sales remain a big part of our business due to it being a convenient, frictionless experience that has been enhanced by continuous technology investments to improve operational execution. On average, it only takes about 10 minutes from the time a guest places an order until it's ready for pickup, which is simply outstanding. Chipotlanes also continue to outperform non-Chipotle locations due to the convenience, which is encouraging since digital order pickup is our highest margin transaction. We continue to look for ways to increase access and convenience through alternate restaurant formats, digital-only menu offerings and leveraging our large and growing loyalty program. As a people first company, we are investing in human capital technology to enhance the team member experience in our restaurants, creating a more efficient, consistent and compliant environment. We recently rolled out a new labor scheduling program as well as began testing radio frequency identification technology to enhance traceability and inventory systems. Also in test is an autonomous kitchen assistant, Chippy that integrates culinary traditions with artificial intelligence to make tortilla chips in our Cultivate Center Innovation hub. Our goal is to drive efficiencies through collaborative robotics that will enable Chipotle's team members to focus on other culinary tasks in the restaurant. We will not sacrifice quality and deliciousness. We are going to place Chippy in a Southern California restaurant soon we can leverage our stage gate process to listen, test and learn from our crew and guest feedback before deciding on our implementation strategy. To accelerate our strategic priorities, we recently announced that we created a new venture fund called Cultivate Next to make early stage investments into strategically aligned companies that further our mission. As a digital disruptor, we are looking to support early stage companies that are forward thinking and will enhance our employee or guest experience, advance our food with integrity mission and perhaps revolutionize the restaurant industry. Our last strategic pillar is to expand access in convenience, which today is still a top request from consumers. In less than 30 years, we reached 3,000 restaurants with over half in the last 10 years. We are relentless in our pursuit of bringing food with integrity to more communities. We're even halfway to our goal of reaching 7,000 restaurants in North America and are building a real estate pipeline that will accelerate new unit growth in the range of 8% to 10% per year, with more than 80% of new restaurants featuring a Chipotle. Our digital order drive-thru pickup line continues to be a favor among guests, giving customers more easy ways to access Chipotle. Last week, we issued Chipotle's 2021 sustainability report update, which highlights our commitment to people, food, and animal, and the environment. We've tied a portion of our executive compensation to achieving various goals, to ensure we've held ourselves accountable for making business decisions that cultivate a better world. The report talks about how we invested in our people, supported our communities and worked to reduce our environmental impact. I'm proud of the strides that we have made to showcase real meaningful action and measurable change. In closing, none of the results that I've shared with you today would be possible without our world-class teams. I want to thank our employees in the restaurants, field teams and support center staff for constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible. As I mentioned at the start, we just brought together 3,200 of our general managers and field leaders and hearing their ideas, passion and enthusiasm for this company convinced me more than ever that we have the right people and the right strategies in place to position Chipotle for accelerated growth in the years ahead. With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials. Jack Hartung : Thanks, Brian and good afternoon everyone. Sales in the first quarter grew 16% year-over-year to reach $2 billion as comp sales grew 9%. Restaurant level margin of 20.7% decreased 160 basis points compared to last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $5.70 representing 6.3% year-over-year growth. The first quarter had unusual expenses related to our previously disclosed 2018 performance share modification transformation cost as well as restaurant asset impairment and closure cost slightly offset by a reduction of legal expenses, which negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.11, leading to GAAP EPS of $5.59. As we look to the remainder of 2022, the remains uncertainty from macroeconomic impacts as well as COVID and make it difficult to provide full year comp guidance. Comps in April so far have continued right around the same 9% we saw in Q1. And while it\u2019s difficult to predict the comp in Q2 due to these factors, assuming current sales trends continue, we expect it to be in the 10% to 12% range as we expect the comp to increase throughout the quarter. Our restaurant level margins continue to be impacted by unprecedented levels of inflation. Our Q1 margin was impacted by a higher level of commodity inflation than we expected, primarily from avocados, tortillas and dairy resulting in our Q1 margin falling below the nearly 22% guidance we provided on our last earnings call. To offset these rising costs, we increased menu prices over 4% at the end of the quarter. And looking ahead to Q2, we expect our restaurant level margin to be around 25%, which will benefit from a full quarter of the new menu prices and assuming we don\u2019t see additional inflation above our current estimates. I\u2019ll now go through the key P&L line items beginning with costs of sales. Costs of sales in the quarter were 31% an increase of about 100 basis points from last year. Costs were higher across the board, but most notably beef, avocados and paper, and more than offset the leverage from our menu price increases. Additionally, cost for avocados, tortillas and dairy increased during the quarter. And in Q2, we expect our cost of sales to remain near 31% as the benefit from our menu price increase will be offset by a full quarter of these elevated costs. Labor costs for the quarter were 26.3% an increase of about 140 basis points from last year. This increase was driven by our decision to increase average wages to $15 per hour in May of last year, which is partially offset by menu price increases. In Q2, we expect our labor cost to be in the mid 24% range due to leverage from our menu price increase as well as seasonally higher sales. Other operating costs for the quarter were 16.4% a decrease of about 50 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven by menu price increases as well as the decline and delivery expenses, partially offset by higher costs across several expenses, most notably utilities, including natural gas. Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 3.5%. The same level we spent last year to support a plant-based chorizo, as well as the launch of pollo asado. In Q2, we expect marketing costs to step down to the mid to high 2% range with the full year to remain around 3%. In Q2, other operating costs are expected to be in the mid 14% range. G&A for the quarter is $147 million on a GAAP basis or $144 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $3 million related to the previously disclosed modification through 2018 performance shares and $1 million related the transformation expenses offset by a $1 million reduction related to legal settlements. G&A also includes $101 million in underlying G&A, $20 million related to non-cash stock compensation, $6 million related to higher performance based bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vesting and exercises and $17 million related to our all-manager conference. We expect our G&A, underlying G&A to be around $104 million in Q2 and continue to grow slightly thereafter as we make investments in technology and people to support ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will likely be around $27 million in Q2, although this amount could move up or down based on our performance. We also expect to recognize about $5 million related to performance based bonus accruals and payroll taxes on equity vesting and exercises, bringing total G&A in Q2 to around $136 million. Depreciation step up in the quarter to $72 million as we accelerated depreciation for several in-store tech items we plan to upgrade this year, for example, adding contactless payment for our in-restaurant guests, as well as for remodels and relocations, that will expand our Chipotlane footprint. We expect depreciation to remain at an elevated level for the next few quarters. Our effective tax rate for Q1 was 16.7% for both GAAP and non-GAAP and both rates benefited from option exercises and share vesting at stock prices above their grant values. For fiscal 2022, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items. Our balance sheet remains healthy as we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt along with the $500 million untapped revolver. During the first quarter, we repurchased $260 million of our stock at an average price of $1,490. We increased our level of stock repurchases during the quarter when our share price fell with the market overall, and we\u2019ll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock. We opened 51 new restaurants in the first quarter of which 42 had a Chipotlane. The performance of our Chipotlanes continues to be strong driving our new store productivity to record levels. Development team continues to do a tremendous job delivering new restaurants, despite the many issues we\u2019re facing, including construction labor shortages, permitting delays and raw material and equipment shortages. Although these issues have lengthened the timeline of our new restaurants, our pipeline continues to be strong and we expect to open between 235 and 250 new restaurants in 2022 with at least 80%, including a Chipotlane. Let me end by expressing my appreciation to our over 100,000 team members in our restaurants, in field leadership teams and in our restaurant support centers for their efforts to serve and delight our guests. I was thrilled to see our general managers and field leaders at our all-manager conference last month and personally thank them for their dedication and hard work over the past several years and share with them the opportunity that they all have as we grow from 3,000 restaurants to 7,000 restaurants in the years to come. With that, we\u2019re happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Nicole Miller : Good afternoon and thanks for the update. If I could just ask two quick ones, I guess, both really centered first on the top line. If the comp is set to improve through the quarter, is it basically saying you haven\u2019t seen any pushback on price? And if I\u2019m looking back in a year ago in 2Q, it looks like traffic comparisons ease as you exit the quarter? Is there anything else \u2013 is that what\u2019s going on? And is there anything else we have to take into consideration in terms of a digital influence or a party size influence around mix shift? Jack Hartung : Yes. I mean, obviously what we\u2019ve seen is very little resistance to the pricing so far. And in regard to kind of entrees per ticket as our in store business goes up, I think it was up like 30-some-odd percent this quarter and kind of digital is held as a percentage. You\u2019ll see some shifting number of entrees per ticket just because the in-store occasion is more of an individual occasion than the digital occasion. Nicole Miller : All right. So that\u2019s where you see a little give back in the mix shift, right, is around an individual order essentially versus a big party order? Jack Hartung : That\u2019s right, Nicole. Because our transactions actually are up, even though we had pricing that was in that about 10% range. Our transactions are up 5%, but our check is down 6%. That\u2019s partly because of group size, which is the shift from digital to in-store that Brian talked about. And then also with digital, you tend to have attachment rates that are a little bit higher with things like queso, avocados, extra meat. And then we\u2019re also comparing against Cauliflower Rice from last year as well. So those are all the things that drove the checkdown. But underlying transactions are healthy. And the price increase is sticking just as expected. We don\u2019t see any resistance. Nicole Miller : Okay. And so just a second and last question, I mean, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019d be looking for any weakness you would observe in the consumer on price or other behavior. And it\u2019s really just a reconciliation of the in-store. I could see one of the criticisms down the road, if the consumer does weaken or the macro, whichever way you want to take it, I\u2019d be curious, if you\u2019re underlying assumption with the development going to be a record setting year, you don\u2019t have franchisees that slow you down. You don\u2019t have landlords or lenders that slow you down. So if you feel the pressure on the consumer, will you slow that development purposefully to lower end of the range? Or will you just keep pushing through? Brian Niccol : No. I mean, our plan is to grow and we think the strategies that we have and the results that we\u2019re getting give us a lot of confidence to stay the course on our growth plans. Jack Hartung : Yes. And Nicole, I would just add. I literally just had a conversation with Tabassum who heads up our Real Estate. We had a leadership meeting and she\u2019s out in the field with her teams and we had that conversation saying, listen, there\u2019s a lot of noise going out there. The market is under stress, interest rates are going up. But no matter what happens out there, we have a strong balance sheet. We know we have a strong economics and we\u2019re in this for the long haul. So make sure your teams realize we\u2019re not slowing down. If anything, if there\u2019s opportunities because others do pull back, let\u2019s take that as an opportunity to go faster, not slower. Nicole Miller : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question will come from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi. Good afternoon. Jack, I just want to come back to the Q2 guidance for my first part of my question. Could you just explain why the comp you expect to get better as the quarter goes on? Is it strictly related to comparisons or is it something else that you think... Jack Hartung : There\u2019s a lot going on, David, comparisons a lot of it. Easter shifted, we see a nice seasonally shift right after Easter and we saw the nice shift this past week. Easter last year was in the first week, it was like the third or fourth. So it was two weeks later. So we definitely saw that step up, which gives us confidence that now we\u2019re in kind of a normal post-Easter phase. In the last week or so since Easter is behind us, we are seeing that step up. We\u2019re seeing the full flow through of the menu price increase and we take those sales trends and then project them through the rest of the quarter. It gives us confidence that we\u2019re going to step up from the approximately 9% that we\u2019ve seen so far month to date in April up to that 10% to 12% guidance ranges that we gave. David Tarantino : Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I wanted to come back, Brian, to your comments about throughput. I guess, this is one of the first calls you\u2019ve highlighted that as a big opportunity in a while. Could you maybe give us a framework for where you are on the metrics you\u2019re tracking versus where you used to be? I guess, prior to the pandemic, I guess, to frame up how much opportunity there is to really drive better throughput and potentially better sales through that attribute. Brian Niccol : Yes. Sure. So if you kind of go back just to kind of set kind of like a range for you. In our best time period, we were kind of in the low 30\u2019s per 15 minutes peak. And then I think you heard me talking about this before the pandemic, we were targeting to get back to the mid 20\u2019s, high 20\u2019s and we were making a lot of great progress where we were closing on the kind of mid 20\u2019s. And now where we are is we\u2019re closing back in to get back to those mid 20\u2019s. So, still a lot of headroom for where we can grow from here. But the thing that\u2019s been really nice is as we\u2019ve gotten stability in the teams, the restaurants are staffed, we\u2019re seeing performance in throughput and we\u2019re also seeing great performance in our digital make line of being on time and accurate. So lots of opportunities on both of those, but to kind of give you the gauge we\u2019re kind of in the mid 20\u2019s on throughput and we\u2019d like to get closer to 30% sooner rather than later. So lots of work to do, lots of opportunity though with it. David Tarantino : Great. Thank you. Operator : And the next question will come from Andrew Charles with Cowen. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles : Great. Thank you. Jack, if we look out past the commodity and labor inflation that\u2019s weighing on the industry in 2022, you guys have previously talked about 27% plus margins when $3 million volumes are reached. Is this still realistic? Is this still a real realistic level that could be reached without having taken outsize level of pricing? Jack Hartung : Yes. Andrew, listen, we still can get to that level. I mean the question is, when and how bumpy is it going to be between here and there. I mean, this really has been the most difficult period I\u2019ve ever seen in terms of commodity month to month, quarter to quarter. But we know that we told in our guidance, we share that we expect to get back to the mid 20% range. And based on that volume to go from the current volumes in the $2.7 million range up to $3 million most of the flow through, most of the GAAP from the mid 20\u2019s to get up to 27% will happen from flow through. And I think there\u2019s going to be other efficiencies that we can find along the way, again, in a normal operating environment. So I still think that 27% is in play at that kind of volume. Andrew Charles : Super that\u2019s very helpful. And then Brian, I know we\u2019re talking a lot on this call as dine in rebounds about priorities in place before the pandemic, where such as throughput. One question I have for you just on catering. Can we talk about the opportunity there and how Chipotle is positioned sees on that as gatherings are happening. I know May is obviously a high volume month for you guys for catering given Cinco de Mayo, given graduation parties. How is Chipotle set up to capitalize on this opportunity? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, it\u2019s a great question. And I think it\u2019s a great opportunity for us. The good news is we\u2019re already seeing catering interests come back. And you mentioned you kind of got kind of the key events for a group gatherings coming up with graduation season. And the team\u2019s done a great job I think of making our digital process a much easier process for people to do the catering. And then, we\u2019ve got a team focused on how we continue to drive those group occasions going forward. So we think there\u2019s upside for sure in it. It\u2019s nice to see the consumer coming back to the occasion and I think we\u2019re well positioned to continue grow in that space. Andrew Charles : Very helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : And the next question will come from Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jared Garber : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. My question\u2019s related to the labor line. Wanted to get an update on where you are, I guess at staffing levels. And maybe I don\u2019t know if the best way to frame that is versus pre-COVID or maybe more appropriate is where those staffing levels are versus how you\u2019re expecting them to run right now, given the level of volume in the business? And then a follow-up on that. We saw last week in one of your releases that turnover was high. I mean, I\u2019m sure it was you as the entire industry. But just wondering if there\u2019s any way to frame, maybe how much incremental labor costs flowed through the system last year and are still are flowing through the system, given some of the incremental training costs and maybe some lower productivity from new employees. Brian Niccol : Yes. So the first part of your question, I would say the good news is we\u2019re in the call it 85%, 90% of restaurants being staffed at model, which is really tremendous. We\u2019ll always want to strive for 100%, but being that 85%, 90% range is really something that would say is better than we were pre-pandemic just to kind of give you a gauge. Pre-pandemic, we\u2019re probably more in the 80% range. Going forward, one of the things that we\u2019re really happy to see actually is at the manager level and above we\u2019re seeing more stability. So we\u2019re seeing less turnover take place there. Usually, how that works then is that cascades into the crew. You are coming up on kind of a season where you\u2019ve got some transition just with kids coming out of college and the end of the school year for people it\u2019s just a shift in people\u2019s working habits. So we do see some bumps in kind of turnover at that timeframe. But I really think we got a lot of strength in our management leadership and when you have strength in the management leadership that cascades into the crew. So we\u2019re liking how we\u2019re set up for kind of coming into the spring summer season. Jared Garber : Great. Thanks. And then Jack, I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s anything on just thinking through labor productivity in the stores, as we think about the margins for the balance of the year and go forward. Brian Niccol : Yes. Jared, I would say we\u2019re in a \u2013 like a \u2013 I\u2019d say a normal operating environment meaning our turnover is normal at the crew level. It\u2019s better than normal for the past few years at the manager level. So that means we always have hours built into our P&L for training. And that works as long as you have a few people a month that you\u2019re bringing on in terms of new crew to train. Now during a time like last year at about this time when we were losing more people, our turnover was up and it was harder to rehire that would put a lot of stress on the system, put a lot of stress in terms of training, put a lot of stress in terms of overtime. So there are stresses not just from how the teams are forming the customer experience, but also the stress on the P&L. And I would say, we\u2019re back to business as usual right now. So I think other than the inflation that we\u2019ve already taken on the labor line, I think going forward in terms of the training, the turnover exclusions, knock on wood seem to be largely behind us with Omicron. It\u2019s business as usual with our hiring training and leading our crew. Jared Garber : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John Glass : Thanks very much. First just a follow-up. Where did wage inflation fall in the first quarter? Some of some of your competitors are starting to talk about some stabilization of wage growth. So it's not that it's getting better, but the rate of inflation is starting to go up. Are you experiencing that? Or is it still an inflationary, meaning accelerating quarter-over-quarter or month-over-month? Brian Niccol : No, it was normal, John. It was more in kind of that mid-single-digit kind of range. I mean, remember, we took that big step up, that 15% raise back in the second quarter. And so, it's been more in the normal range, but it's on top of the 15% we already took. John Glass : Thank you. And Brian, you mentioned automation and this Chippy robot or whatever it is that that makes chips. How big an opportunity do you see this? I understand these are longer-term bets. But is there \u2013 how big an automation opportunity is there within Chipotle? Is this something that could have a meaningful impact over time on store margins? Are there more tasks you're looking at to automate? Or is this sort of a one-off and kind of an interesting thing to test? Brian Niccol : No, look, I think there is a real opportunity frankly to make the restaurant be much more efficient. Obviously, Chippy is our first attempt. And we've worked with a lot of our employees to identify what are the tasks that they would love to see us bring automation to or AI, so that hopefully the role can become less complicated. And then I think there is just other places in the back of the restaurant where we have the ability to automate, whether it's on the digital make-line or other tasks. I think there is just tremendous opportunity for us to become even more efficient where it results in a better employee experience and also a better customer experience. And that's really the lens we're using on this. John Glass : And do you think that's years away or quarters away? And what's the time \u2013 as you look at where the technology is today? Or what's the time horizon which this starts to really materialize? Brian Niccol : Look, I think the technology is very close in. The ability then to scale it and get it installed. That's what we have to learn. And we're getting ready to put Chippy into a restaurant and then we've got a lot of other initiatives in works at our Cultivate Center. So the technology is actually close in. The prototypes are close in. It's then putting it through the stage gate process and really understanding people's ability to scale up and then actually install, assuming it performs the way we think it's going to perform. John Glass : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. A quick follow-up on the throughput opportunity you mentioned. Where do you often see the bottleneck if there is one or that maybe on the other side lead you to an initiative or an area of focus for you? Obviously, you're measuring people against this in terms of speed. But maybe there is a certain area in that, whether it's a kitchen or other. And I'm wondering also is your labor scheduling tool a part of this solution? Brian Niccol : Yes. So it's twofold. It is having better deployment, which, obviously, the labor scheduling tool will help us with that. It also better informs our forecasting as well versus moving from just looking back over the prior four weeks and trying to project up prior four weeks. It's now using real-time information to project what's going to happen in the coming week. So what we see is a better forecast, which results in a better schedule. And then what it also helps us do is deploy correctly. And the reason why the deployment is important is we need people to be in their positions, right. And the most \u2013 probably most pressing spot is that expedited role, which is really in between kind of the last phase of making your bowl of burrito and getting to cash. And if the team isn't deployed correctly, but sometimes that's the spot that doesn't get the right support. And as a result, it kind of slows the line down. But obviously, it all has to work in concert, right. You need to have people that have had a lot of reps. They need to be trained to be able to move people down the line and make the bowls and burritos correctly. But it's the combination of those two things, having people in the right positions and arguably one of the most important positions is that expediter position, the way you get there is to make sure you got a right forecast. David Palmer : And then I just \u2013 one about just insights. As we get into a little bit more of a mobile consumer environment and maybe people getting back to work, are there any sort of emerging realities that are surprising to you about perhaps your dinner staying were at higher levels, your lunch not coming back as quickly as you'd like, maybe competition taking share as they're reopening in certain trade areas, any insights there about the reopen. Brian Niccol : No. The biggest thing I would tell you is the more we see people have mobility, the more we see our lunch business come back. And the nice thing is we've seen these new occasions whether it's a dinner occasion or a group occasion remain pretty sticky in the business. So I think the thing that is playing out is what people that have had experience with us for new occasions love the culinary and they're using us for these other occasions. And our rewards program, I think, is doing a nice job of understanding those journeys and then building the right engagement going forward. So mobility is a key piece of the puzzle because you want people out and about and you want people go into their office or going to their activity. That's how you get that restaurant experience back. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Jon Tower from Citi. Please go ahead. Jon Tower : Awesome. Just quick in terms of a \u2013 well, bookkeeping and then a question. In terms of the delivery mix in the quarter, I was wondering if you could comment on where that settled. And then just thinking about the labor situation going back to that point, I know obviously, you guys have made quite a bit of investment in your employees over time and have given them a nice path to make a lot more money over time, assuming they earn it in the system. But I'm curious, when you think about the investments that you made, do you think that's enough to keep people engaged into the balance of this year and going forward? Or do you foresee perhaps even more labor investment necessary in the future outside of just normalized inflationary spend? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, I think the one thing I want to emphasize on labor is what we've heard from people that are with our company. So they've been with us five, six, seven years, what they get excited about is all the growth because they can go from being an apprentice to a general manager to a field leader to a team director, regional vice president. And it's a reality because we're building 200, 300 restaurants a year. They know they have to be developing themselves and others, so that they can step into the next opportunity. That's where they get the greatest change in both, I would say, professional satisfaction as well as the wages that come with it. We do know we've got a very competitive starting wage, but what people get really excited about is where that starting wage can take them. And our company can take them really far and also really quick. So it's great that we have all the other benefits that I think separate us and continue to be consistent with our purpose of cultivating a better world. But when I've had the opportunity to get out in the field and talk to people, what they're really excited about is the fact that they're a part of a company that's committed to its purpose and committed to growth. And that growth is both for them as an individual as well as those that work around them. And that's what we're going to keep investing in. So we haven't seen a whole lot of pressure on the starting wage, where we are putting a lot of pressure is on making sure that we're developing our people, so they're ready for the growth. Jon Tower : Got it. And just delivery mix and then the second piece in terms of\u2026 Brian Niccol : Yes, sorry, delivery mix is like low 20s, 20%, 21%. Jon Tower : Okay. And in terms of thinking about. Sorry about that. Brian Niccol : No, no. Go ahead. Jon Tower : I was just going to ask about pricing expectations for the balance of 2022. Obviously, you just took a chunk recently. Curious if all else holds for the balance of the year based upon your expectations for wage rate inflation and obviously commodities appear to be all over the map. But at this moment, are you anticipating future pricing action in the balance of 2022? Brian Niccol : You know, gosh, I really hope we don't have to take more pricing, but I'm going to kind of give you the same answer I've been giving you for the last, call it, 12 months, which is, if it moves and we can't find efficiencies to offset it, the good news is we've got the pricing power to make a move. I really don't want to be ahead of it. So I think a great example is probably what you just saw over this last quarter. Look, inflation continued to move in a big way. We saw it wasn't going away, so we had to take the pricing action that we did. And hopefully, that won't continue to be the case. But if it has to be the case, we have, I think, the organization, the people and the pricing power to do it, but it really is the last thing I'd like to do. Jon Tower : Got it. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Thank you. And the next question will be from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you. I wanted to revisit some of the numbers that were in the ESG report that you guys published because it did look like some of the general manager and field level turnover was actually up 2021 versus 2020. Was that something that just happened maybe in the middle of the year as part of kind of the great resignation we've seen a significant improvement in trends? I guess did that surprise you in any way? And I guess how has some of that normally maybe slightly more stable, your employee base changed as we've come into 2022? Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So obviously, that's looking back at 2021. And yes, look, there were a lot of ups and downs with Omicron. There were a lot of ups and downs with wages. And obviously, that was a tough time to be running restaurants. There was a lot of situations where you were understaffed. And then it was very hard to get people to sign up to work. And the good news is we've made tremendous progress. Obviously, we've increased our starting wage. I think we've done a much better job of explaining the growth path at our company. And then illustrating that growth path by having 90% of our promotions come from internal promotion \u2013 internal employees. So that's why when you fast forward to 2022, we're in just such a better place with stability, definitely at the manager level. And then I think that will follow into the crew. So what the challenges were in 2022. I think we get them. And we're leaning into our purpose values and growth platforms to keep people excited about being at Chipotle. John Ivankoe : And hopefully, this is an appropriate follow-up. But obviously, in the last six months or so, labor units have really become a very topical subject for companies that didn't quite frankly, even mention them for years of discussion of covering some of these means, both in the retail and the restaurant side. It's obviously great that you guys recently had in all manager conference that was just in March. I guess what can you do? I guess you'd kind of always stay in front of that issue and maybe de-risk that from a Chipotle perspective? Again, hopefully, that's a perfect question to ask in a public call. Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, I mean, what we're committed to is developing our people and growing people that want to be at Chipotle. And the best thing we can do is make sure that they're trained, so that they're successful in their job, and then that we give them a culture and a leader that develops them so they realize they have the growth opportunities at Chipotle. And that's why \u2013 look I can't remember who asked the question, but it's kind of \u2013 hopefully, you're not surprised by my answer when you asked like, well, what's next after Chippy. Well, the answer is we talk to our employees to find out what would be the tasks that would make sense for us to automate in the restaurant to make the employee experience better because we know if the employee experience improves, we'll have better retention and also we'll have better execution than for our customers. And so we really spend a lot of time communicating and taking action on how we can improve the employee experience. And then we spend the time developing our people. And you mentioned, we just had this all manager conference, right. I mean, it was electric man. It was so great to have all our leaders in one place understanding the future of Chipotle and how they play such a critical role. And we had the opportunity to have everybody in the room stand up that's been promoted over the last four years and you know what, almost every person in the room was standing up. I don't think there are many places where that happens, so we have to continue to stay committed to our purpose, our culture and the development of our people. So that when you end up at all manager conferences, and you got just about everybody in the room standing up because they've been promoted or they've developed others that have gotten promoted so that's what we're focused on. That's our proposition. That's who we are. If you want to be a part of that we're going to be building lots of restaurants that present an opportunity for you to be a part of it. John Ivankoe : That's great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thank you. Jack, I wanted to ask another one on margins and thinking about cost pressures over the balance of the year. Great insights on the 2Q and kind of getting back to that mid-20s level already and recognizing there's a lot of moving pieces through the year, but is there any additional color that you could share even at a high level in thinking about back half restaurant margins with respect to food inflation? I guess particularly in light of how Brian, just spoke to pricing philosophy, if there's anything you can add at a high level there? Jack Hartung : Yes. We \u2013 again, we just had at our leadership meeting, of my group, we talked to Carlos, our Head of Supply Chain and there's nothing we can see on the horizon that says, things are going to retreat, that things are going to go down, but things have at least for the time being stabilized. So that's what right now we can hope for as a stable environment, we do expect there's going to be an inflection point at some point. The pressures of getting some of our like packaging, for example, in from overseas, the pressure that some of the suppliers are having, whether it's from a labor standpoint or just from a cost standpoint for their input costs, what we can hope for is that, that they don't step up from here. They stabilize. And at some point they just kind of normalize in the future, but right now, if I was going to build a model, I would not build in a reduction in food cost for the fourth quarter, it looks like it's more going to be something in 2023 before we see that. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thank you. And then just one quick one, apologies if I missed it, but could you guys speak to kind of the percent of the dine-in sales or traffic that have recovered at this point, I don\u2019t know if you can touch on kind of that overlap with digital, that digital dine-in customer. And then related to that, just how exciting the further dine-in recovery can be here as it relates to how low that that overlap is, if there's any commentary there. Thank you. Jack Hartung : Yes, look, I think one of the things we mentioned was our in-restaurant sales increased by 33%, while digital remained roughly 40% of our business, right. And one thing that I mentioned earlier in the call is as we continue to see people increase their mobility, I think we will continue to see gains in the in-restaurant experience. And I don't see these digital occasions just disappearing. I think they're going to continue to play their role and we're working hard on keeping digital to be frictionless and just completely intuitive. And then at the same token, we're working hard on having great throughput with great culinary and the good news is there's a lot of room to grow in both of these things. That's why we're optimistic, we'll get to 3 million AUVs. And while we do that, we're going to build a lot of restaurants. So I think we're in a really good spot. And obviously I'm excited for, hopefully COVID staying behind us and inflation stabilizing, and hopefully in 2023 maybe you can see some improvement on that front. But regardless, I think we've demonstrated we've got a business, a brand and an organization that can handle it all. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Lauren Silberman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Lauren Silberman : Thank you for the question. Jack, I think you had mentioned new store productivity at record levels. Can you just provide an update on where new unit productivity and cash on cash returns are running today? Jack Hartung : Yes. The productivity's been in that kind of mid-80s to high 80s, depending on the quarter, it may have touched like 90% from time to time. And what I mean by that is that's the percentage of mature restaurants of our comp restaurant when we deliver those kind of openings, sales, when most of them are Chipotlane, which is more efficient than a non-Chipotlane. Our cash-on-cash returns are in the 40%, 45% range out of the box. When you put a couple years of comp on that, as they basically close the gap and get very close to our average volumes, our comp restaurants, we're talking about returns in the 60%, 65% returns within just a few years. Lauren Silberman : Great. Thank you for that. And just on menu innovation, can you talk about how you are thinking about menu innovation for the rest of this 2022 and specifically just how you're thinking about opportunities for innovation around proteins versus other parts of the menu? Jack Hartung : Sure. I think we've kind of established a pretty good cadence here where we do, call it two to three menu initiatives a year. And we have a few protein initiatives in place that, I'm sure you'll see in test. And then we're continuing to work hard on trying to figure out a dissert proposition or another call it add-on item, right. So to compliment how we have guac on, 50% of our transactions, I think queso on like, what is it, 20 some odd percent something of our transaction. So it's like if we could find another add-on like that, whether it comes as a dessert or in that space, like a queso guac, you'll see us continue innovating in those areas. But we think we've got a lot of room to still I think excite and engage customers with the chicken steak plant-based solutions and at the same time look at these other add-on opportunities. Lauren Silberman : Great. Thank you guys. Jack Hartung : Sure. Operator : The next question is from Brian Vaccaro from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Brian Vaccaro : Thanks and good afternoon. Question was on the commodity inflation backdrop and sorry if I missed it, but Jack, what was inflation on the basket in the first quarter? Jack Hartung : Yes, it was in that like 12% to 13% range. Again it's the highest inflation I've ever seen. Brian Vaccaro : Yes, I guess\u2026 Jack Hartung : Hopefully we've seen the last of it. Like I said, in a few comments ago, things have stabilized for now. If you get one month in a row, that's stabilized, that's a start, but let's see what happens the next two or three months to see if we see stable costs. Brian Vaccaro : Right. And if you did see that stabilization sort of hold, would you start to see that year-on-year inflation moderate into Q4 or at this point, are you just thinking, we'll be in the low teens for now, until that dynamic changes? Jack Hartung : Yes. I mean, listen, as you go throughout the year, if it stabilized completely that 13 is going to tick down as we compare to some of the inflation we saw last year, but most of that 13 is going to be with us for the rest of the year. I think importantly is the food cost that we talked about being in kind of that 31% range if commodity costs stay stable, we should stay in that range for the rest of the year. And we know that our margin, we have our full margin potential ahead of us, if we keep our food costs in that like 31% range. So knock on wood that things stabilize to make pricing increases we've taken so far will give us that margin potential that we know is possible. Brian Vaccaro : All right, great. That's helpful. And then on the comps, could you just level set, if you don't take additional pricing, where would effective pricing be over the next couple quarters? And then on mix specifically, does that start to normalize now on a year-over-year basis? I know we're kind of, there's been some funky comparisons on the mix front, the last four quarters now it seems, does that sort of flatten out next several quarters? Jack Hartung : Yes. Well, on menu prices, they'll step up a bit in the second quarter. So we'll move from like call it a 10, 10.5 to like call it a 12.5, something like that. Then it steps down to a little under 10, then it'll step down in the fourth quarter to like in an 8.5. Mix, it just depends on the mobility that we talked about before, mix for the foreseeable future is going to be at this lower check size, because we're comparing to \u2013 last year where most of the year, a good part of the year still had very heavy digital. I mean, we did start stepping down near the end of the year. So I think you're still going to see like year-over-year, the group size is going to be lower. There's going to be relatively, in terms of a percentage growth, like we saw 33% growth in in-restaurant versus digital. I think you'll see some numbers like that. So I still think you're going to see some distortion where the group size is getting smaller and you're going to see transactions grow while the average check, excluding menu price increase is going to decline a bit, but we'll keep you guys updated each quarter on what those components are. Brian Vaccaro : All right. That's very helpful. Thank you. I'll pass it along. Jack Hartung : Operator, is there one more question? Hello? Jack Hartung : Well, I don't know if we're having technical trouble. We can't hear the operator or anyone else. We're about at the end of the time. So Brian, I don't know if you want to make a closing comment. Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So I'll just close this real quick. Thanks for taking the time. Thanks for the questions, obviously very proud of our results in the quarter. Very proud of the work that's been done today. I think the one thing that's worth reminding people, there's a few things that haven't changed, right. We have a great brand, we've got a great culture. We've got a unique purpose around cultivating a better world. And we've got tremendous growth in front of us both within the existing restaurant, between the combination of our in-restaurant opportunity and our digital business, as well as adding additional restaurants across the country. And one thing that I'm confident about is our culture. Our people will capture the upside for this business and continue to drive growth going forward. So thank you for taking the time. And I look forward to talking to you next quarter. Take care.",

Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian Niccol : Thanks Cindy and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased with our second quarter performance during a period of inflation and consumer uncertainty. For the quarter, sales grew 17% to reach $2.2 billion driven by a 10.1% comp; in-store sales grew by 36% over last year; digital sales represented 39% of total sales; restaurant-level margin was 25.2%, an increase of 70 basis points year-over-year; adjusted diluted EPS was $9.30, representing 25% growth over last year; and we opened 42 new restaurants, including 32 Chipotlanes. I would like to spend a couple of minutes providing insight into current trends and our outlook. Regarding Q2, through mid-May, comparable sales were on track to reach the top end of our guidance range. Since then, the underlying trend has decelerated and we anticipate mid- to high single-digit comps for Q3 with planned pricing in August. There are a couple of key things we have learned during the quarter. Our pricing power is strong and the brand is resilient, our culinary and food with integrity commitment is a key point of difference, our restaurants are staffed with terrific people despite a difficult hiring and retention environment, and our people are still getting up to speed on running a growing multimillion-dollar digital business as well as a growing multimillion-dollar in-restaurant business. To accelerate this learning curve, we are instituting an ops initiative focused on being brilliant at the basics. We did this in 2019 and saw a positive impact on the business right up to the pandemic in 2020. I will discuss this in more detail later. And finally, we are focused on the right strategies. It is as important as ever that we remain focused on our five strategies that help us to win today while we create the future. Now, let me provide a brief update on each of these strategies, which include number one, running successful restaurants with a people-accountable culture that provides great food with integrity, while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences. number two, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants and support centers; number three, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level; number four, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings; and number five, making the brand visible, relevant and loved to improve overall guest engagement. Let's start with discussing running successful restaurants. I'm happy to say that I've seen lines out the door in mobile pickup shelves full in Boston, Philadelphia, Denver, Austin and Arbor, Dallas, Cincinnati, London, Paris and Los Angeles. I think everybody gets the point. Fortunately, we were staffed with terrific employees, and they were working hard with smiles on their faces and great attitudes. I'm very proud to say that our restaurant teams have successfully grown average unit volumes to about $2.8 million, with 39% being digital. Our general managers and teams have adapted well to our growing digital and growing in-restaurant business. However, customers were waiting on digital orders and the front line was moving, but it could have been quicker. I know we can be better. This is why we have launched an ops initiative, focused on retraining our crew members on the fundamentals of our business. These fundamentals include having great culinary prepared and ready to serve, open to close in a food-safe environment; ensuring that restaurants are staffed and appropriately deployed across both the digital make-line and front make-line; improving order accuracy and timing for the digital business; and increasing throughput in hospitality for the in-store business. Additionally, we completed the rollout of our new labor management tool that helps put the right people in the right place at the right time. We believe the combination of being brilliant at the basics with the new labor management tool will drive meaningful productivity in our restaurants. Along with our labor management tool, our technology road map remains robust. I think it is worth highlighting how we are investing in technology to support strong execution of the basics. We just installed new customer-facing pin pads that offer faster and contact-free payment options. We've deployed a new learning management system that enables immersive ways for our employees to experience training and provides digitally enhanced e-learning courses, videos and resource materials. We also are in the process of updating our POS hardware across the system, which should be completed by this year, and we have made DML enhancements that aid accuracy and throughput. These recently completed or in-flight programs will all be positive for our restaurant teams and guest experience. Additionally, we will continue to invest in possible technology for the future, like Chippy, the autonomous robot we are testing that integrates culinary traditions with artificial intelligence to help our teams make tortilla chips, bringing up their time to serve and support our guests. And we are exploring an automated real-time kitchen production system that ensures high-quality food is available to meet the needs of our guests. This brings me to our Cultivate Next venture fund, which is off to a great start and is giving us a front-row view of emerging food technologies. We are interested in our breadth of innovations, including sustainable farming, supply chain advancements, restaurant operating efficiencies and ways to elevate the employee and guest experience. We've received a lot of interest with over 200 inquiries for investments. And as you may have heard last week, we announced our first investments in Hyphen and Meati. Hyphen is a food service platform that automates the assembly of meals on a make-line and could help fulfill our promise to deliver on time, accurate orders for our digital guests. We look forward to sharing more investments in the future that will help us drive meaningful change at scale. I do want to take a moment to discuss our people. Despite a challenging labor market, I am proud to say our staffing levels remain above 2019 levels. Our purpose of cultivating a better world with Food with Integrity has created a brand that people are proud to represent and be part of. We continue to offer a world-class employee value proposition that includes industry- leading benefits, attractive wages, specialized training and development, access to education and a transparent pathway to significant career advancement opportunities. We believe these efforts, along with our growth and purpose, are helping to attract and retain great employees. And our people development program is important in order to accelerate our new restaurant openings. The real estate pipeline remains strong and supports our target of 8% to 10% new restaurants per year with more than 80%, including the Chipotlane. We now have 430 Chipotlanes, and results continue to exceed our expectations with Chipotlanes generating higher average unit volumes and higher restaurant level margins. In fact, a recent opening of a Chipotlane in a small town in California had one of the highest opening day sales in the company's history. In addition to the US, we are also excited about our progress in both Canada and Europe. Canada has hit a stride with AUVs and returns that are at the same level as the US, and Canadian comparable sales trends remain strong. We currently have 29 locations in Canada and longer term; we see room for several hundred, which is included in our target of 7,000 restaurants in North America. And Europe continued to move through the stage-gate process. We have made significant progress in improving the economics in Europe, driven by operational efficiencies, adding our digital systems and opening smaller formats that resemble the US restaurants. We have opened five new restaurants in the UK over the last 18 months, and results have been strong. We are gaining confidence that Europe could be another layer to our growth story in the future. This brings me to making the brand visible, relevant and loved everywhere we operate. Our Real Food for Real Athletes campaign focuses on helping athletes across all levels perform their best by providing proper nutrition through real food and real ingredients. As on official sponsor of the NHL, we activated this relationship through traditional media and creative promotions to highlight Chipotle, including having our logo in the ICE for every game of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Additionally, we have partnered with US soccer to create behind the scenes content that showcases how Rose Level and Sofia Smith overcame the challenges of competing at the highest level of women's soccer. And later this year, we will file the US Men's National team via our sponsorship and with advertising during the World Cup. We also continue to appear in nontraditional channels to drive difference, culture, and ultimately, a purchase. We recently launched Burrito Builder on Roblox on National Burrito Day. The first 100,000 players to successfully roll a virtual burrito at a virtual Chipotle earned a free entree unwrap. These led to one of our best digital sales days and marks the first time a brand enabled Roblox player to earn and exchange virtual Roblox currency for real-world items. Okay. Moving on to the menu. Our pipeline remains robust. Building upon the brand's recent success with menu innovations, including smoked brisket and Pollo Asado, we have tested and successfully validated Garlic Guajillo Steak, and this steak is ready for rollout in the future. Shifting to our digital experience. We now have a digital business tracking towards $3.5 billion in sales, and we currently have over 29 million rewards members. We are mining the data every day for insights, while leveraging the information to influence behavior and drive greater frequency. We are also working aggressively on greater personalization across the customer journey and obtained valuable insights on, which incentives provide the greatest ROI. Additionally, we're excited about the recent launch of the rewards program in Canada, which will provide another way for Canadian guests to engage with the brand and provide Chipotle with the ability to further delight its Canadian Rewards members. Finally, our digital ecosystem is rolling out in the UK, and France will follow shortly thereafter. To conclude, there is much uncertainty we are all dealing with, but what I am certain about is Chipotle and its people will remain committed to leading and growing. I'm certain that over time, we have the ability to grow our average unit volumes and achieve at least 7,000 restaurants across the US and Canada. I'm certain that we will move our purpose of cultivating a better world forward in a meaningful way. I'm certain that Chipotle provides one of the best value propositions in the industry. I'm certain that we have the right teams with the right focus to navigate whatever comes our way and that our culture will continue to offer our crews terrific career opportunities.  Finally, I'm certain that we are well positioned for long-term growth. Lastly and very importantly, I want to thank our restaurant teams for their hard work and contributions to making Chipotle one of the best restaurant brands in the world.  With that, here's Jack to walk you through the financials. Jack Hartung : Thanks, Brian. Sales in the second quarter grew 17% year-over-year to reach $2.2 billion as comp sales grew 10.1%. Restaurant-level margin of 25.2% increased about 70 basis points compared to last year. And earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $9.30, representing nearly 25% year-over-year growth.  Second quarter had unusual expenses related to certain legal proceedings, our previously disclosed 2018 performance share modification, transformation costs as well as the restaurant asset impairment and closure costs, mostly offset by an unrealized gain on investments, which negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.05, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $9.25. Regarding our sales trends. As Brian mentioned, we were on track for comparable sales to reach the upper end of our guidance range for the first half of the quarter. Since then, we've experienced a step down due to a combination of macro pressures, our ability to handle the growth with relatively new workforce and a return to normal summer seasonality for college-based restaurants. For perspective, about 15% of our restaurants are in college town, and we've not seen normal seasonality in 3 years.  Looking ahead to Q3. With pricing from last year rolling off, our current trends in July are running in the mid-single-digit range. Assuming current sales trends continue, we expect our comp to be in the mid- to high single-digit range, which includes our planned August pricing increase of about 4% to help offset incremental inflation pressures, especially in dairy, tortillas and packaging as well as pockets of wage pressure throughout the country.  I'll now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 30.4%, about flat to last year. The benefit of menu price increases  offset elevated costs across the board, most notably in avocado, packaging, dairy, beef and chicken. In Q3, we expect our cost of sales to be about 30% of sales, as the benefit from the menu price increase will be partially offset by the higher cost of dairy, tortillas and packaging. Labor costs for the quarter were 24.8%, an increase of about 30 basis points from last year. This increase was driven by our decision to take a meaningful step up in wages last May, which is partially offset by menu price increases. In Q3, we expect our labor costs to be about 25% due to leverage from our menu price increases offsetting pockets of wage pressures across the country. As Brian also mentioned, we have now completed the rollout of our labor management tool. While our teams are still learning how to use the tool, we believe it has the potential to lead to better deployment to both make lines during peaks, which we think will eventually lead to better throughput on our front serve line and better on-time results for the P&L. Other operating costs for the quarter were 14.3%, a decrease of about 90 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven by menu price increases, as well as a decline in delivery expenses, partially offset by higher costs across several expenses, most notably utilities, including natural gas. Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 2.5%, 10 basis points above last year. In Q3, we expect marketing costs to remain in the mid-2% range with the full year to average right around 3%. In Q3, other operating costs are expected to be in the mid-14% range.  G&A for the quarter was $141 million on a GAAP basis or $130 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $7 million due to the settlement of certain legal matters, $3 million related to the previously disclosed modification to our 2018 performance shares and $1 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also includes $106 million in underlying G&A, $25 million related to non-cash stock comp and a $1 million benefit related to lower performance-based bonus accruals, partially offset by payroll taxes and equity vesting and exercises. We expect our underlying G&A to be around $111 million in Q3 and continue to grow slightly thereafter as we make investments in technology and people to support ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will be around $25 million in Q3, although this amount could move up or down based on our performance, bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q3 to around $136 million. Depreciation was $70 million, and we expect it to remain at this level for the rest of the year. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 25.3% for GAAP and 25.1% for non-GAAP. For fiscal 2022, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate to be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items. Our balance sheet remains healthy as we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt along with a $500 million untapped revolver. During the second quarter, we repurchased $261 million of our stock at an average price of $1,350. We increased our level of stock repurchases during the quarter when our share price fell with the market overall, and we'll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock. During the quarter, the Board authorized an additional $300 million to our share authorization program. And at the end of the quarter, we had $320 million remaining. We opened 42 new restaurants in the quarter, of which 32 had a Chipotlane. The performance of our Chipotlanes continues to be strong, maintaining record-high new store productivity. In terms of development, we continue to navigate various challenges, including construction and permitting delays and material shortages. However, our team has done an outstanding job of anticipating these challenges and mitigating delays where possible. And we still anticipate opening between 235 and 250 new restaurants in 2022 with at least 80%, including a Chipotlane. As I mentioned last quarter, once we move beyond these development challenges, we expect to be able to accelerate openings and get closer to the high end of the 8% to 10% opening range. In closing, I've experienced Chipotle's resiliency over the past 20 years through both great times and challenging times, and I share Brian's confidence in our ability to navigate the current environment. Looking forward, I'm excited about the growth opportunity ahead of us with a runway to more than double our restaurant base and grow AUVs beyond $3 million with a 40% flow-through. I want to thank our 100,000 employees in our restaurants and in support roles for their continued effort and commitment to Chipotle. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Nicole Miller with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Nicole Miller : Thank you. Good afternoon. Hoping you could talk a little bit more about labor in terms of staffing. In the context of AUVs being up versus 2019, well more than 20%, just because you had mentioned that in regards staffing levels in regards to 2019 today, are you suggesting that it needs to be more efficient in terms of labor or that you need more bodies in terms of staffing? Like, how does it compare to the context of the AUV increase, if that's applicable? Brian Niccol : Yes. Hi, Nicole. The way to think about it is, obviously, our labor model reflects our increase in transactions and sales. So we look at it as, is the restaurant staffed at model given the volume and transactions that the restaurant has. And what we're referring to is, the percentage of restaurants that are staffed correctly is better than what we -- where we were in 2019. So that's what we're referring to. And then what we're talking about is, obviously, a lot of the people that have joined our company over the last two years, they really haven't experienced the front line and what it means to grow that in-restaurant business, while also growing the digital business. And that's why Scott and the operators are focused on ensuring that everybody is brilliant at the basics to execute our growing two lines of business. Nicole Miller : Okay. And then, just can you briefly discuss in terms of last year's 15% comp, how things tracked in July, August and September? So we can understand a little bit about what to think about compares from the prior year period. Jack Hartung : Yes. Nicole, this is Jack. You'll remember that in the second quarter of last year, we did have a staffing challenge, and that's when we took the significant increase. So we did compare during part of the quarter to a little bit of a softer comparison. But since we announced in May, I think it was like around mid-May that we were increasing wages, and right at that moment, we started paying the higher rates as new people are coming in. And the announcement that we made at that time was also a signal to our existing teams that you're going to get a raise in early June. So we saw staffing stabilize, and then we saw our sales recover. So we did have a several week period during the quarter where we did have a little bit softer comparison. Nicole Miller : Okay. And how about July, August and September of last year? The comp was 15% last year, right, in the third quarter? Is there anything -- how does that look? Jack Hartung : Those were -- I would call those normal comparisons. By then, our staffing has stabilized. And so, those are other tougher comparisons. Nicole Miller : Okay. So each month was kind of 15%? There was no notable difference between the months? Jack Hartung : Yes. Listen, they vary very month-to-month, but there was nothing during the quarter that I would tell you makes that comparison. I would say, if anything, Nicole, just compared to Q2, it's just a little tougher of a comparison overall. Brian Niccol : But each month was fairly\u2026 Jack Hartung : They didn\u2019t bounce all over the place. Brian Niccol : They didn\u2019t bounce all over the place. Jack Hartung : Yes. Nicole Miller : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And the next question is from David Tarantino from Baird. Please, go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about the comp trend. I guess, I first wanted to understand how you're thinking about the slowdown you saw towards the end of the quarter. And I know you rolled over some pricing, so maybe had some less pricing contribution. But you seem to be also pointing out some operational challenges that may have caused that. And I guess, how do you determine whether it's that versus maybe just a general slowdown in consumer spending, if you will? Brian Niccol : Yes. Hey, David, obviously, it's hard to tease out some of the macro pressures versus what we're seeing as far as people peeling off the line for potentially not being happy with potential order time. But what we've definitely seen, as I've been out visiting restaurants, and when we talk to our leaders in the field is we've got a lot of new people that are still getting trained up on, frankly, the basics of great throughput. And I feel like this is rinse and repeat, but that's what our business is a little bit, which is we got to have our aces in places. You got to have the expeditor. You got to have the linebacker. You can't work around those things to try and service the business. And we just have a lot of new people that don't understand how important some of those roles are as well as general managers, too. A lot of these managers have gotten promoted over the last 18 to 24 months. So, we know there is upside in taking the combination of this new labor tool, deploying people correctly and then ensuring that those people are trained and actually experience what great throughput looks like. That's the other biggest thing. These -- a lot of these folks haven't experienced what -- how fast the line can move. So, I think in some cases, folks think they're moving pretty quick when in fact we could be moving a lot faster. David Tarantino : Got it. And Jack, could you help us understand what your transaction levels or growth was in the second quarter and what your third quarter guidance implies on that metric? Jack Hartung : Yes. David, the transactions were up in the quarter between 3.5% and 4%. We also had a mix shift. We didn't talk about that for a number of quarters now as our business has moved more towards in-restaurant. The average group size -- well, the mix shift was about a negative 6%. The average group size dropped by about 4.5% and that drop is mostly a drop from the business moving from digital into in-restaurant. So, as we move to Q3, we do expect that -- because of the downturn that we saw the macro effects in the second quarter, we do think that transaction comp will ease a bit, but we also think that the negative mix shift should ease a bit as well. David Tarantino : And Jack, one clarification. When you say ease, do you think it will stay positive, I guess? Was this your guidance to assume it's positive, or are you thinking\u2026 Jack Hartung : David, it's going to be right around slightly positive or right around flattish, right around in that range. David Tarantino : Okay. Thank you very much. Jack Hartung : Thanks David. Operator : The next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. John Glass : Thanks very much. My first question is just maybe clarify a little bit more why seek more pricing now. It seems like your margins are where you thought they should be you're sort of balancing the inflationary impact versus pricing. And you're also now confronting a weaker consumer. So, why now versus maybe letting some pricing lapse and maybe waiting longer and just out of the abundance of caution? Maybe your thoughts on that, please. Brian Niccol : Yes. What we've seen is -- unfortunately, a lot of things have stuck versus gone away as far as inflation. And then we've got some key items that have frankly continued to be inflationary. And I think Jack highlighted it right. We've got avocados, we've got dairy, tortillas, some packaging. So, unfortunately, we were hoping we'd see some of the stuff pull back. We haven't seen that. But there are other parts of the business that we have seen plateau, which gives us optimism that, hopefully, we won't have to continue to pull the pricing lever. And I think you've seen this with us. We really do try to wait until we truly understand what feels like is something that's an ongoing cost that we need to handle with pricing versus, hey, we're going to wait this one out and see if it pulls back. So we figured best to share where our heads are on this one now. John Glass : I appreciate that. On -- thinking about your softness that you experienced post May, was there any particular part of the business that it showed up in first? I'm thinking did the delivery channel, for example, exhibit weakness? What piece of the business decelerated more than others? And was there any signal in that in terms of the behavioral change of the consumer? Brian Niccol : Yeah. I think what we saw was probably not all that different from what people have been saying. The low income consumer definitely has pulled back their purchase frequency. Fortunately, for Chipotle, that is not the majority of our customers. The majority of our customers are a higher household income consumer. And we've actually seen their frequency increase and potentially not experience, I'm guessing, some trade-down from other areas where they were choosing to get their leading occasion. So probably the first indicator was in our, I'll call it, our rewards data, where we saw some of these low income consumers starting to slow down on purchase frequency. John Glass : And not necessarily impacting the delivery channel specifically, which one might think of as being an expensive channel? Brian Niccol : No. No. Actually, that's been pretty stable throughout. John Glass : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And the next question is from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. Just a question -- a follow-up question on the topic of mix and the impact of essentially the number of people per order. One casual dining company out there said that family seemed to be getting back to pre-COVID summer behaviors. So perhaps that family orders that happened last summer are going away as they get back to doing some of those other activities. Do you think -- is it, I don't know, possible for you to see that in the numbers or in any of your insights data that perhaps there's almost a seasonal headwind that's going to be particularly bad here over the summer and it coincided with that, not just economics? Jack Hartung : I mean, David, there is the other thing that we saw was even a group size in-restaurant did decline a little bit. It didn't decline as much. Overall decline was in that 4.5% range, and it was bigger -- the bigger piece of that is a shift from digital to in-restaurant. But even within the in-restaurant customers, the group size did shrink a little bit. So I don't know if I would connect those dots. But if you're seeing other evidence that families are returning to the way that they would dine three years ago where they're not all getting together and dining together, that could be at play. We also, for the first time in three years, saw kind of normal college seasonality, meaning the college restaurants really performed exceptionally well during the school year because they were all in-person. And then we saw seasonality that we haven't seen in three years, where the college students go back home and they tend to eat less. I don't know if that's more mom's home cooking. But they -- when we track the individual customers, they tend to visit Chipotle to a lesser degree when they're away from college than at college. So we are definitely seeing some normalization under the overall trends. David Palmer : And in the past, you've talked about an incremental margin framework. Maybe something like 35% to 40% would be normal. Obviously, the first half has been below that, particularly in the first quarter, maybe catching up to a bit here in the second quarter. With the four points of price that you're talking about, do you feel like you're going to be getting back to that incremental margin from here on out? Jack Hartung : That's right, David. In fact, that's exactly why we did what we did. We still have some additional going to see carry into Q3 for tortillas, dairy, packaging and some known increases related to beef that we've known for a while all those roll into Q3. And really, what this allows us to do is, when we get up to this, we've talked about a $3 million average volume, and then our margin should be somewhere in the 27% range that gets us back to that kind of a situation. And the pass-through for every incremental sales dollar we get in should be right back to that 40%-ish flow-through that we've talked about in the past. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Sara Senatore : Thank you. I wanted to ask about throughput and I know a lot has changed as we think about transaction baskets. But historically, you've given some estimates about peak-hour throughput. And I just wanted to see if you could give some context around where you are now, especially now that you have a second make-line, whereas previous peak would have been mostly the front make-line.  And is there a way to kind of quantify what improving throughput could do for transactions to your point about not losing people off the end of the line? Is there sort of a framework we can think about that says, one transaction per hour is equal to a point of comp or something like that? I'm just trying to understand as we think going forward, the guidance for transaction contemplates any improvement in throughput? Brian Niccol : Yes. I mean -- so here's one of the things that we have done because you point out that we've now got this multibillion-dollar digital business, multibillion-dollar in-restaurant business. We've separated out the metrics for the frontline and the digital make-line. And we've got very specific. On the digital make-line, it's about being on time and accurate. And on the frontline, it's about throughput. And we believe on that frontline, we can get back to where we were. Let's check, like 2014, '13, where we were in the high 20s, low 30s. Jack Hartung : On a 15-minute basis. Brian Niccol : On a 15-minute basis, that's what we're going back after. And that's why it's so important. We really kind of did this exercise back in 2019 and we're starting to see it pay dividends in kind of early 2020. And then, unfortunately, COVID hit. And so, we're confident that if we can get our team members to understand what it means to be, call it, rush-ready in their places and ready to go, there's no reason why we can't get back to those high 20s, low 30s on a per 15-minute basis. I don't know if we've talked about exactly how the transactions translate into sales\u2026 Jack Hartung : I don't know if you want to go that far. Well, here's what I would say about that, Sara. It's hard to tease through and find out when you increase. Let's say you move from like 22 to 27, okay, that's a 5-entree increase. As a perspective, each \u2013 every time you add by transaction, that's a percent of comp, okay, for that day. We're measuring the fastest 15-minute period.  So, what we believe is that when you go faster in 15-minute period, you're going to go faster in multiple 15-minute periods. So, the opportunity to add quite a bit of comp is there. But to Brian's point, we just need to get more reps. We have a lot of folks that really haven't been on the frontline. They haven't even managed a restaurant when we had the in-store business coming back the way it is today. So -- but we believe that there's definitely the opportunity to add some meaningful comp here. Sara Senatore : That's super helpful. Thank you. Sorry, just one follow-up on mix. Was there any sort of lower attachment or anything like that, or it's strictly the sort of lapping the order aggregation? Jack Hartung : No. I mean the only thing I would clarify on that, Sara, is there is a higher attachment rate to digital. And so when you see people move from digital to an in-restaurant visit, then you also see a return to less attachment. We also -- by the way, we are seeing higher drinks. The fact that we've got more people coming into the restaurant, we are seeing more drinks. And just to give you a perspective, about 40% of our transactions in restaurant included a drink. Only about 20% or slightly less than that of a digital transaction. So as we've seen this shift, there's been a positive shift as well but not enough to offset the lower group size. Sara Senatore : Thank you so much. Operator : The next question is from Jared Garber from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jared Garber : Thanks for \u2013 thanks for the question. I wanted to just ask about menu innovation. Brian, I know you mentioned that the Guajillo Steak is sort of past its stage-gate process and ready for launch, whenever that may be. But wanted to also get a sense if you could update us on the other item that's in test, which is the Mexican cauliflower rice and how you think about maybe more permanent menu item as a plant-based base for consumers over time. Brian Niccol : Yes. Obviously, we're very interested in that new way of eating. And I think we mentioned this in our earlier comments. We've invested in a plant-based company called Meati. And the idea is how can we continue to find plant-based items that are consistent with our food ethos, that also are delicious from a culinary standpoint. So we've obviously done the cauliflower rices. We have the sofritas that's on our menu all the time. I'm optimistic that hopefully, we can find another center of plate or call it center of bowl solution that's plant-based, which we haven't done to date, right? It's really been a plant-based read. So the qualifier of these things have been more perceived as, I would say, a piece of your bowl versus the centerpiece of your bowl. And so that's what we're working towards. And I'm excited to see what we learn as we partner up with Meati. And obviously, our culinary team continues to work aggressively in this space. Jared Garber : Thanks. That's helpful. And then just one follow-up on the throughput, which seems to be a little bit of the topic of the day. Is there anything similar across maybe either geographies or store bases that you're seeing throughput as more of a challenge? Maybe that's an urban thing or a suburban thing. Just curious what you guys are seeing in terms of any read across or tie-ins across the geography. Thanks. Brian Niccol : Yes. No, really, you're not seeing that. I'd say probably the experience is where we see the biggest difference. We have restaurants that are doing $6 million, $7 million. That team has been together for years. And when -- as soon as kind of all the COVID restrictions went away, they went right back to running Chipotles really successfully. And that's why we're so confident in so much opportunity in just getting people, the reps, getting them trained up on the basics and then, frankly, just for them to experience the success that they have by following these basics. So ultimately, what we're really after is the better throughput actually results in a better employee experience as well. And we probably should talk about that a little bit more because our employees that are more successful -- and then obviously, they give a great experience to our guests. But yes, I'd say the biggest thing -- and fortunately, we have experienced managers all over the country, so we don't see any variability from like region or suburban, urban. It's more along the lines we just got to get more people trained up. Jared Garber : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles : Great. Thanks. Brian, can you talk a little bit more about how Chipotle plans to flex value in the menu in the current consumer backdrop as you run double-digit pricing while lapping what looks like about 10% price in the back half of 2021? I know earlier in your career, snacking and looking at the shoulder period between 2 and 5 PM was an opportunity. Is that something that you think applies to Chipotle just given the background for lower income consumers? Brian Niccol : I really believe the value proposition what we sell today is our strongest proposition. We looked really hard at this. When you look at a chicken burrito, steak burrito and you compare that to your alternatives, the value is there. And so if -- I think we execute great accuracy and being on time and we execute great throughput. That's our winning formula. That is the value proposition that wins. And that's why we're very much focused on executing our basics. The basics drive our value. So great culinary, customized, and then with Food with Integrity is a winning value proposition for all income levels. Andrew Charles : And my follow-up question is just on another one on culinary. Just talking a little bit more just around Pollo Asado and the ability to keep that on the menu. I know it's a higher margin, obviously, tested very well and it's done very well for you guys. Is the plan to keep that permanently? It's gone a little bit longer than a typical limited-time offer would run? Brian Niccol : No. The plan is not to keep it permanently. I think we've talked about this. Ideally, we like having menus two to three times a year. And if we get some that can carry longer, we stay with them longer. But that will eventually be coming out here in the next couple of months. And hopefully, we'll have some other menu news that gets people equally as excited. Andrew Charles : Looking forward to it. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Lauren Silberman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Lauren Silberman : Thank you for the question. On unit growth, so on track to accelerate unit growth to 8% to 10%. Can you talk about what you expect with respect to cannibalization and just the trade-off between unit growth and comp? Jack Hartung : Yeah, Lauren. We measure the impact, and we don't see -- we've never seen impact go above a 1% comp impact. We've seen it go up to 0.7%, 0.8%, something like that. So it's still very, very manageable. And so every time we do a deal, we go through a routine where we have an algorithm where we measure what we think the impact is going to be. Our team does a really good job of measuring that. It's still an estimated part art, part science, but we look to do deals that are going to give us a superior after impact return. So we're not looking to put restaurants right on top of each other and cause excessive impact, but there's just a lot of white space out there still. We -- with this idea of getting from 3,000 to 7,000 restaurants, we've modeled that after our three or four or five most end markets, and those are markets that we already have the density that represents what we would be on a national basis at 7,000 restaurants. And those restaurants are very high-volume and very high-return restaurants. Lauren Silberman : Great. Thank you for that. And then just on potential AUVs, the AUVs are now running at 2.8 million, high end of restaurant peers. You've talked about the opportunity for increased throughput. 40% o f sales going through the secondary digital make-line. How are you thinking about peak AUV levels and where that can go? Is there a level where it makes more sense to open another restaurant? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, I think one of the things that truly special about Chipotle is we are not capacity-constrained with our front line or our digital make-line. So I mentioned, right, there's restaurants doing $5 million, $6 million, $7 million. And obviously, it presents an opportunity for us to build a lot more restaurants without having really any meaningful impact. But I think it also just demonstrates the four walls that we're already running Chipotle has tremendous upside as well. So I'm feeling really confident we're going to get past $3 million, and I'm sure we'll probably be talking about how we get to $4 million at some point. But I first like to get past the milestone of $3 million. We can celebrate that milestone. And the good news is I don't see any capacity constraints that would prevent us from saying $4 million is next up. Lauren Silberman : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : And the next question is from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Please go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Thank you. Brian, a quick follow-up on throughput question again. Is there anything else to stare on sort of that opportunity to get back by 2030 throughput for 15 minutes? Can you do that in the current staffing environment? And is it really more about training the ops initiative that you mentioned as well as the experience, I think, of the teams work there? Just trying to get a sense for how generally quickly gains can happen across the large system as we think about throughput kind of frame that up for us. Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, I think the good news is we have lots of opportunity to execute what we know are the basics of great throughput, right? Like -- unfortunately, I've gone into a lot of restaurants, and we don't have our expeditor in place. That is a key piece of the puzzle. And the good news is our operations leadership is very much focused on explaining to people how important that expeditor role is. Because if you're new, you could see why you would think of, maybe I can flex that person when, in fact, that's the last person you want to be flexing if you want to really achieve great throughput. So look, the good news is staffing is not a barrier. Frankly, the barrier we have to get -- we have to overcome is getting people to experience what it's like to run a restaurant with everybody in the right place, doing the right role through a peak. And obviously, it will take a little bit of time, but that's something that we can train, people can experience. And like I mentioned, we saw a lot of progress on this when we did this back in 2019. So I'm confident, we can get focused and get the reps and then get the execution that then results in the comp growth. Dennis Geiger : That's great. And then you spoke to this some, but I just wanted to ask a little bit more on resiliency, sort of your expectations for resiliency, increasingly difficult macro environment. The brand meaningfully outperformed in 2008, 2009. Obviously, you've been extremely resilient and brand strength over the last several years. But anything you could kind of highlight, maybe differences or similarities prior tough economic periods where the brand has outperformed? And just broadly, anything additional that you could add on sort of resilience for the brand from here? Thank you. Brian Niccol : Yes. Sure. Well, look, I think probably the thing that's common when you look back to what we're seeing right now is the strength of our higher-income consumer. That's a common factor. So even though the lower income consumer is slowing down, we've not seen that happen with our higher income consumer. And fortunately, for Chipotle, we over index with higher income consumers. And I think the other piece of the puzzle, too, is now we've got a database of, call it, 29 million, 30 million people, where we can hopefully be on the front-end of what is happening out there, so that we can hopefully pivot and communicate correctly with our customers. And what we've heard over and over again is our value proposition is probably our greatest strength, meaning terrific food or terrific culinary, unbelievable customization, if you want it digitally, it's on time, right, and it's accurate. And if you come into our restaurant, you love the customization and the speed of which you can get it. So good news is it's a lot of similarities of what we've seen in the past. The one thing I know for sure is something will be different. So that's why I think it's important to talk about just how resilient the organization is to also handle whatever unexpected headwind we'll deal with. Dennis Geiger : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you. Hopefully, a slightly different take on the throughput question. Is your throughput -- is it constrained, the 12 :00 to 1 :00 and 6 :00 to 7 :00, kind of the classic times that you used to be busy, or are there kind of pockets throughout the day, I guess, is kind of the first main question? And secondly, if there are just certain hours where you're throughput constrained because of staffing, I guess, what is the store manager? What does the system do? I mean people obviously don't want to come in and work for an hour shift or even a two-hour shift. Does the brand have the flexibility? Does the model have flexibility to bring people in for four to eight hours to maybe cover a couple of busy hours? So just kind of walk us through, I guess, the practicalities of actually staffing that store, that front make line or the second make line, during those 15 minute windows as if you really are capacity-constrained? Brian Niccol : Yeah. Well, first, so we're not capacity constrained at 12 :00 to 1 :00 or 6 :00 to 7 :00 or 1 :00 to 1 :30. The good news is we've got capacity in every 15-minute increment. Now your question about how do you best deploy so that you have the right amount of people in place ready to go, that's really the reason why we've implemented this new labor tool. It's going to do just that, right? So, it\u2019s going to go ahead and say look at like this restaurant is slammed from 11 :00 to 11 :45. This restaurant is slammed from 12 :00 to 12 :30. This restaurant has a really big dinner business. So it takes into that account so that we deploy the right amount of people against those peaks. We're not capacity constrained. So if we can get the people at the right time in the right position, our throughput is going to go up. For a second there, John, I thought you worked for Cronos. But\u2026 John Ivankoe : And just by capacity constraint, it's capacity constraint for given number of employees that you have on that given shift, not for the overall box itself. I get that. Brian Niccol : Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah. And that's exactly what this is supposed to help us address so that you don't end up with you're understaffed from 11 :00 to 11 :45 and you're overstaffed from 12 :45 to 1 :30. The idea is we get our people in the right places at the right time. So -- and that's the tool that we just rolled out. And now we're training against the tool to ensure people are in their place so that we can execute the maximum throughput we can in each of those 15-minute increments. Jack Hartung : And just to add on, Brian, the tool also recognizes like where is the business? Like how much is digital? How much is front line? Brian Niccol : Oh, yes. Good point, too. Jack Hartung : Our old tool wasn't as sophisticated. And so if one restaurant has 20% digital, another has -- like in our Chipotlanes have 55% to 60% digital. The staffing model is very different for those two things. So our ability to really put exactly the right people with the right skills at the right time throughout the day to drive throughput has never been better. Now this is a brand-new tool. It's like learning how to drive a Ferrari. When you first get in the car, there's -- it's a very, very highly sophisticated tool. And so we're learning how to use that. But the capabilities are much higher than what our previous tool allowed. John Ivankoe : No, thank you for that. And if I can, obviously, this wouldn't be rolled out in the system unless it obviously went through the extensive operational stage-gate system. I mean how big of a pilot did you do for the system before you decided on the system-wide rollout? And how effective was it in that collection of pilot stores? Brian Niccol : Yes. Yes. So look, we've been piloting this for over two years. And we did really the bulk of the rollout for the last six months across our restaurants. So it's a new tool for our teams. The good news is it's not a new tool for our organization to manage, train against and get people to use it to its best ability. Look, there is a change management process, though, in anything. No matter how good it is, sometimes people really like the old approach better even though the new approach is going to help them perform better. So we're going through the change management process as any organization would but the good news is we've done the due diligence on the front end so that as we learn things -- and we're dealing with 100,000 people. So I'm sure we will learn some things even beyond our pilot. We have the know-how, though, to pivot accordingly and maximize the tool. John Ivankoe : Thank you. Operator : And the next question will be from Chris O'Cull from Stifel. Please go ahead. Chris O'Cull: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I had a follow-up on the value question that was raised earlier. It seems like a potential scenario could be where commodity prices start to ease, traffic continues to soften for the industry, and that would cause some change to be more aggressive with either price-led value promotions or even maybe new value menus to kind of reset their pricing. I'm just wondering how Chipotle might respond, if discounting or menu reset like that were to start to impact that value gap it has with the competitive set? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, obviously, if our value proposition changes dramatically, we have to reevaluate how we're providing our customers value. I haven't seen it happen yet. And when you go back and look the 20-plus years of the company, the thing that drives the best value with our customers is this commitment to Food with Integrity, it is this commitment to culinary and then it's this commitment to getting you exactly what you want. So I'd be hard-pressed to believe we would want to abandon what makes us Chipotle. And my experience as well as what I've seen in the company is our value proposition is very strong. So long as that is the case, we're going to keep doing what we know drives value with our customers. Chris O'Cull: Fair point. Jack, I apologize if I missed this in the presentation, but can you speak to the level of inflation you're seeing in construction cost? And maybe describe some of the most common challenges you're seeing with hitting project time line? Jack Hartung : Yeah. The time line, it's a myriad of challenges. Sometimes it's permitting, sometimes it's contractor labor. Like if somebody has call-outs or exclusions because of COVID exposures that will slow down a deal as well, and then materials as well. I mean, some of the electronics, like for some of our HPC, walk-in coolers, things like that, have been a real challenge. So it's been a myriad of challenges. The pipeline is really, really strong. That's what gives me great confidence that not only will we hit between the range this year. But when these things ease, our pipeline is still there and we'll be able to accelerate from there. In terms of the inflation, it's at least in the several percent range, maybe even more than that. The deals have varied throughout the country, but definitely our investment cost this year are much higher than they have been in the past and higher than we expected them to be. Chris O'Cull: Great. Thanks guys. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Brian Niccol : All right. Thank you. And thanks, everybody, for joining and all the questions. Obviously, we're very proud of our results. I think it speaks again to the resiliency of both the Chipotle brand, all of our employees out in every restaurant, their ability to execute great culinary, great throughput. And I also think it speaks to the strength of our value proposition. So I know there's a lot of uncertainty out there. I said this in my earlier remarks. The thing we spend our time on are the things that we can control, the things that we're certain about. And what I am certain about is Chipotle has got great people running restaurants that do food in a different way. And we continue to give people great access through digital and great throughput on the front line with good hospitality. I think we'll continue to be rewarded with more business. And we're proud of where we are, and we're really excited about where we're going. So, obviously, we'll see what comes next, but I think we're ready. And we'll continue to do what we know how to do best, which is make great burritos, great bowls. And hopefully, we continue to delight our customers so that they come back over and over again. So thank you for taking the time and we'll talk to you all in three months. Operator : Thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Olsen, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead. Cindy Olsen : Hello, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our actual results could differ materially from those projections in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian Niccol : Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrated the resiliency of the brand and strength of our organization in managing through a difficult consumer environment along with the inflationary headwinds we have experienced over the past 18 months. For the quarter, sales grew 14% to reach $2.2 billion, driven by a 7.6% comp. In-store sales grew by 22% over last year. Digital sales represented 37% of sales. Restaurant-level margin was 25.3%, an increase of 180 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $9.51, representing 35% growth over last year. And we opened 43 new restaurants, including 30 Chipotlanes. In the third quarter, we continue to see a widening of trends by income level with the lower income consumer further reducing frequency. Fortunately, for Chipotle, the majority of customers are from higher-income households, which continue to increase purchase frequency. While it is difficult to predict the macro impact on future spending trends, we know our value proposition remains strong and we experienced minimal resistance to our price increase in the quarter. To put it into perspective, our average chicken burrito or bowl, which makes up about 50% of our orders across the U.S., is below $9 in our restaurants. This is a tremendous value when you consider the quality of our food, including our food with integrity standards, the fresh preparation utilizing classic cooking techniques, the customization, generous portions and of course, the convenience and speed. Our fresh preparation is particularly unique when comparing Chipotle to other restaurants. There are not many restaurant options that prepare their food fresh daily, and we do it in all 3,000-plus restaurants. Our restaurant teams begin preparation at 7 :30 in the morning to be able to serve our delicious food by the time we open. We only use 53 real ingredients, all of which you can pronounce and our dedicated employees prepare the food in our open kitchens using classic cooking techniques. This includes grilling Fajita Veggies and Adobo Chicken on the Plancha and mashing avocados to make our signature guacamole and making our chips fresh every day. So again, when you combine all these elements, you get an industry-leading brand with a tremendous value offering. And our five key strategies will continue to help us win today while we create the future. Now let me provide an update on each of these strategies, which include : number one, running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; number two, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants and support centers; number three, making the brand visible, relevant and loved to improve overall guest engagement; number four, expanding access convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings; and number five, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level. First, starting with our restaurants. We remain focused on being brilliant at the basics, including staffing our restaurants with talented team members focused on the foundations of the business. These include having great culinary prepared and ready to serve, open to close in a food-safe environment, improving order accuracy and timing for the digital business and increasing throughput in hospitality for the in-restaurant business. At the end of last quarter, we rolled out an updated training program called Project Square One, which includes training around throughput, digital execution, food quality and hospitality to deliver an exceptional customer experience. We've made some progress during the quarter, but we are not where we need to be. The capabilities of our teams needs to and will improve. Chipotle is a restaurant business with high standards, and we need to train and develop our teams so that these standards are met. Additionally, in these uncertain times, it is critical that we treasure the guest, and this will be a primary focus of everyone in operations and across our company. With so much change over the past couple of years brought on by the pandemic, it has been refreshing to focus on the foundation which Chipotle was built. We do see that our highest volume restaurants are meaningfully outperforming lower-volume restaurants in terms of throughput. What these restaurants have in common is experienced managers include that understand the importance of the foundations. As our newer restaurant employees go through the training and get more real-time reps, we believe we will see consistent improvement over time. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to look for ways to enhance our tools and systems to support in-restaurant execution and improve the overall experience for our employees and guests. I am excited to share a pilot that we recently announced as well as an update on Chippy. We are piloting advanced location-based technology to enhance our app functionality and provide a seamless, convenient experience for our guests. For guests who opt in, the program can engage with Chipotle app users upon arrival to our restaurants and utilize real-time data to enhance their experience with our order readiness messaging, wrong pickup location detection, reminders to scan the Chipotle Rewards QR code to checkout and much more. And I'm happy to share that Chippy is now in one of our restaurants, and we are excited to test and learn from the autonomous robot that helps our teams make tortilla chips, bringing up their time to serve and support our guests. Chippy is trained to replicate Chipotle's exact recipe to cook the chips to perfection, finishing with a hint of lime juice and a dusting of salt. Additionally, Chippy can make chips throughout the day, which results in fewer outages and improves freshness. Moving to our branding, our Real Food for Real Athletes platform continues to expand as we rolled it out to football, America's most watched sport. The campaign focusing on athletes that love to eat at Chipotle as part of their training and lifestyle as it helps them to perform their best by providing proper nutrition through real ingredients. At the pearl level, we brought together The 88 Club for the first time in an ad with Dallas football greats who were the #88: CeeDee Lamb, Michael Irvin, Dez Bryant and Drew Pearson. The 88 Club TV ad premiered during Sunday night football and all of the athletes go-to Chipotle orders were featured in our app. Chipotle's 88 Club content achieved great engagement with millions of views across channels. Additionally, at the college level, we took a local approach with the Real Food for Real Athletes campaign in Ohio, which is one of our biggest markets and where we have our largest restaurant support center. We partnered with Ohio State offensive lineman and running back TreVeyon Henderson, on an ad narrated by former Buckeye running back great Archie Griffin. Tapping into the passion, the fans have for their favorite teams and game day excitement, the ad showcased TreVeyon's journey before he runs onto the field and was amongst our highest engaged videos in social media channels. Shifting to LTOs. We remain comfortable with our cadence of one to two LTOs a year as it excites our guests and is driving both higher frequency and spend. As you may have seen, we launched Garlic Guajillo Steak in mid-September, which is an entirely new flavor profile featuring tender cuts or freshly-grilled steak with the bold flavor of garlic and guajillo peppers and finished with fresh lime and cilantro. In maintaining our relevance in the Metaverse, we premiered the Garlic Guajillo Steak to our community on Roblox where users could grill, season, cut and virtually taste the steak. The first 100,000 users who successfully completed the Chipotle Grill simulator, received a promotional code that can be redeemed in our restaurants. Again, showing our ability to blend the Metaverse with real life. Complementing the Roblox experience, we also provided early access to our 30 million Rewards members as we continue to provide Rewards members with added value. While still early days, Garlic Guajillo Steak is getting excellent customer feedback and is driving a higher check as a premium protein experience. However, it is faced with the challenge of rolling over our highly successful Brisket program last year. As a reminder, Brisket ended in mid-November and the Garlic Guajillo Steak program will go through the end of the year. Additionally, following the success of Pollo Asado, we began testing Chicken Al Pastor in Denver and Indianapolis. Chicken Al Pastor adds an exciting level of spice to guests' go-to orders. And if successful in the stage-gate process, it could be available for rollout in 2023. Our next strategic pillar is expanding access, which is still a top request from consumers. We remain on track to open 235 to 250 new restaurants in 2022 and anticipate opening between 255 to 285 restaurants in 2023 barring any further delays in construction or equipment availability. Our pipeline remains strong. And as these challenges ease, we are confident that we can get to the top end of our targeted 8% to 10% range. In addition to expanding in our core markets, we remain excited about new opportunities, including Alberta, Canada and small towns in the U.S. We plan to enter Alberta, Canada in 2023 with our first location in Calgary. Alberta makes the most sense as our next market to open in Canada as it has two of the main cities, including Edmonton and Calgary, each with relatively large populations. Additionally, there is brand recognition as people from Alberta have visited Chipotle restaurants in British Columbia and Ontario. In the U.S., our small town strategy is also performing very well. Overall, small town restaurants have comparable margins and returns to the company average, and we're excited about the growth opportunity, which is included in our 7,000 long-term restaurant target. I'm also proud to share that opening day sales for a restaurant in a small town in Texas was a new company record. I would like to express my congratulations and gratitude to the restaurant and development teams for making that one happen. And speaking of teams, our purpose of cultivating a better world starts with our people. The importance of developing our people is paramount to running great restaurants as well as developing future talent to grow. I'm delighted that over 90% of our promotions are internal, and I believe we will continue to see that percentage go up. There are many examples of senior leadership roles that started out as crew members. In fact, one story that particularly moved me was about our team in the Mid-Atlantic region, where our Regional Vice President, Team Director and Field Leader were all promoted from within the organization in March. Our RVP immigrated to the U.S. from Egypt and his first job was as a crew member in 2009. He is another person that has worked his way up from a crew member to Regional Vice President overseeing $1 billion in sales. For perspective, that would be the fourth largest company in Egypt. His successor as Team Director immigrated to the U.S. from Palestine in 2017 with his first job as a crew member and now oversees a $200 million business. And finally, his successor is a field leader who is a woman, who immigrated to the U.S. from Ethiopia in 2015, who also started as a crew member and now oversees 7 locations totaling $20 million in sales. Their perseverance is inspiring to many and a great example of how our growth and brand changes lives and communities for the better. Each of these individuals is also developing terrific talent that has the ability to become future leaders. For perspective, each year just in the United States and Canada, we have the opportunity to promote more than 1,500 managers to open our new restaurants. In addition to career opportunities in industry-leading benefits, we also believe that communication between leadership and our restaurant teams is critical. We do this through several ways, including chitchats, where members of our executive leadership team meet with our restaurant teams to listen to their feedback. Through this feedback loop, we were able to identify that our teams wanted more educational benefits, which is why we implemented debt-free degrees and career certificates. And team members who have participated in our educational programs are 2x more likely to be retained and 6x more likely to be promoted. Supporting, developing and growing our people will remain a core focus for Chipotle and is key to growing to 7,000 restaurants. In closing, I want to thank our employees for another great quarter. We remain committed to getting back to the basics and running great restaurants. I believe these actions will position us for strong performance in any environment and more importantly, is key to delivering an excellent customer and employee experience. I'm excited to see everyone back in our restaurants next week for our 22nd year at Boorito. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jack. Jack Hartung : Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to start by reiterating Brian's commentary about treasuring our guests and earning every single transaction. During past periods of economic challenges, focusing on our guests, getting the details in the restaurants right and providing a great dining experience has served as well. As Brian mentioned, this will be the primary focus of our organization and what we believe will lead to building an even stronger brand for the future. Now moving to our third quarter results. Sales in the third quarter grew 14% year-over-year to reach $2.2 billion as comp sales grew 7.6%. Restaurant-level margin of 25.3% increased about 180 basis points compared to last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $9.51 representing over 35% year-over-year growth. The third quarter had unusual expenses related to onetime employee separation expenses, corporate and restaurant asset impairments, corporate restructuring and our previously disclosed 2018 performance share of modification. Looking ahead to Q4, our current comparable sales trends are choppy as we lap our Brisket LTO from last year and we expect our October comps will likely end in the mid-single-digit range. Assuming current sales trends continue, we expect our comps to be in the mid- to high single-digit range for the full fourth quarter as Garlic Guajillo Steak will be in restaurants through the end of the quarter compared to Brisket, which ended in mid-November of last year. Earlier this month, we took a price increase in around 700 restaurants to address pockets of outsized wage inflation. Menu prices in each restaurant increased between 2% and 3%, which had a company-wide impact of about 0.5% overall. And I'll go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 29.8%, a decrease of about 50 basis points from last year. The benefit of menu price increases offset elevated costs across the board, most notably in dairy, packaging and tortillas. In Q4, we expect our cost of sales to remain at about the same level as the benefit from the menu price increases will be offset by higher beef, chicken, dairy and tortilla. Labor costs for the quarter were 25.1%, a decrease of about 70 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven by sales leverage and somewhat offset by wage inflation as well as lapping the employee retention credit that we received in Q3 of last year. In Q4, we expect our labor cost to be in the mid-24% range due to leverage from our menu price increases as well as our premium price Garlic Guajillo Steak. Other operating costs for the quarter were 14.5%, a decrease of about [60] basis points from last year. This decrease was driven by sales leverage as well as a decline in delivery expenses due to lower delivery sales, partially offset by higher costs across several expense categories, most notably utilities, including natural gas. Marketing promo costs for the quarter were 2.2% or 20 basis points below last year. And in Q4, we expect marketing costs will be in the mid-3% range with the full year to come in right around 3%. In Q4, other operating costs are expected to be around 15%. G&A for the quarter was $141 million on a GAAP basis or $136 million on a non-GAAP basis excluding about $4 million in employee separation and corporate restructuring costs and $1 million related to the previously disclosed modification to our 2018 performance shares. G&A also includes $115 million in underlying G&A, $21 million related to noncash stock compensation, a $1 million benefit related to the reversal in lower performance-based bonus accruals, mostly offset by payroll taxes on equity vesting and exercises. We expect our underlying G&A to be around $120 million in Q4 and continue to grow slightly thereafter as we make investments in technology and people to support our ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will be around $25 million in Q4, although this amount could move up or down based on our performance and $1 million for costs associated with our field leader conference in early 2023 bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q4 to around $146 million. Depreciation was $71 million, and in Q4, we expect it to increase slightly to $73 million. Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 24.4% for GAAP and 23.4% for non-GAAP, and both rates benefited from option exercises and share vesting at elevated stock prices. For Q4, we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items. Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with over $1.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt, along with a $500 million untapped revolver. During the quarter, we repurchased $107 million of our stock at an average price of $1,438 and we've repurchased a total of $628 million year-to-date so far. We increased our level of stock repurchases during the quarter when our share price fell with the market overall, and we will continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock. During the quarter, the Board authorized an additional $200 million to our share authorization program, and at the end of the quarter, we had $413 million remaining. We opened 43 new restaurants in the third quarter, of which 38 had a Chipotlane, and we remain on track to open between 235 and 250 new restaurants in 2022 with at least 80%, including a Chipotlane. As Brian mentioned, we anticipate opening between 255 and 285 restaurants in 2023 with at least 80%, including a Chipotlane. Development delays remain a headwind, including equipment and construction material shortages, construction labor challenges as well as permitting, utilities and inspection delays. While we expect these challenges to persist into 2023, our pipeline remains strong, and we expect to move towards the high end of our targeted 8% to 10% openings range once these headwinds subside. To conclude, we believe we have a tremendous growth opportunity ahead of us with room to more than double our current presence in the U.S. and Canada over the long term. We will remain focused on what makes our brands special. And that is our purpose of cultivating a better world, our food integrity standards, a strong unit economic model and of course, our talented and dedicated teams. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from David Tarantino of Baird. David Tarantino : I have a two-part question related to your pricing and traffic trends. So first, I was wondering if you could share what your transaction trends were in the third quarter and what the guidance implies for the fourth quarter? And then I have a follow-up related to that. Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So in the third quarter, I think of transactions were down roughly 1%. A lot of the additional headwinds we've had with kind of the mix shifting as people return to their kind of normal course behavior has resulted in smaller group sizes. So that's kind of consistent with what we've seen. And then in the current quarter, obviously, we've got Garlic Guajillo Steak, launching right now going over top of the Brisket. And then I think as we mentioned, we're continuing to see some pressure on the low-income consumer. So we're still seeing transactions be pushed in that negative range. And obviously, we'll continue to keep an eye on it as we go forward. Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything to that. Jack Hartung : Yes, just pricing during the quarter, Dave, we're running right around 13%, and that will move up a bit in the fourth quarter. So that's part of our guidance as well. I think the big thing in the fourth quarter to note is just Brisket was very successful last year, and we ran out of inventory in the middle of November. And so the comparison actually gets easier in the second half of the quarter. David Tarantino : Great. That's helpful. And then my follow-up, Brian, is I think you're aware there's been a lot of concern about the pricing strategy hurting the traffic. And I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're not seeing resistance to the price increases yet. So I just wondered if you could comment on, I guess, how you're thinking about your price position now and how you think about the traffic trends you're seeing and whether or not you think that you've seen any resistance. It doesn't sound like you think you are, but I guess the traffic being slightly negative, just wanting you to have a chance to address that. Brian Niccol : Yes. Sure. Well, I mean, look, the simple fact is the absolute price point in the business is still very competitive and frankly, very attractive relative to -- you look at regional players. The -- when you look at the fast casual competitors, we're anywhere from 10% to 20%, 30% less than what you see on their menu. So you've seen, unfortunately, in all this inflationary environment, everybody is taking price. So our costs, I think, are up over 20% over the last two years. Not surprising, other people are experiencing something similar and they've taken pricing accordingly. So our relative position to our competitors or the alternatives for what you can get when you read out, really, we stayed in a really strong position. So that value proposition remains strong. And then when you look into the business, we're not seeing people all of a sudden not buying guacamole or also changing what they typically add to their order or switching between proteins. Things have stayed pretty consistent. And then the last piece I'd add to that is if you go to the grocery store, there's a lot of inflation there, too. So if you think about all the places where you can get food, they're way up. And our relative performance in that environment is one where we're still a great cost opportunity, I guess, for the consumers, the way I would describe it. So getting a chicken burrito exactly how you want, at the speed at which we can provide with the culinary and the ingredients that we provide for roughly $9 or less. That's tremendous value. Operator : The next question comes from Nicole Miller of Piper Sandler. Nicole Miller : On that point of price, components of mix and traffic. Can you just talk about the price piece? So what is the art and science that you blend for the here and now? And how do you think about using that tool to protect margin? But then also long term, how do you exercise that pricing power or not against the long-term like unit opportunity, which I imagine really is requires affordability, right, appealing to the masses. So if you could talk about that a little bit, that would be great? Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So I mean, that's exactly right, Nicole. The way we're trying to balance this is really only use price as the last lever to pull. And I think that's what we've done throughout the course of the last, call it, two years because we like having the strong value proposition, frankly. I like being in the position where we have the best culinary with the best ingredients and arguably the best price. And so it's a position of strength and it's a position we want to hang on to as we go forward. The reality is in an inflationary environment, you're going to have to pull that lever. And that's why I think it's really important to look at how your pricing stacks up relative to people's alternatives. Those alternatives are either the grocery store or other restaurants. And when you look at those, our value proposition remains in a really strong place. So we're delighted to continue to see new units opening at a terrific opening rate. They're still achieving 80%, 85% of what our typical restaurants do. Our Chipotlanes continue to outperform. And then frankly, even in our small towns, we're continuing to see just tremendous opening. So I think that tells me we're getting signals in all different fronts that our value proposition remains really strong whether it's a new restaurant coming to an area or an existing restaurant competing in an area that we've been competing in for a while. So that's the needle we're trying to thread. Nicole Miller : And as that applies to the fourth quarter commentary then, is that just price that's flowing from August into 4Q? Or could you speak to incremental price in the fourth quarter to get above that 13%? And is that essentially being used to protect margin, even though, I guess, you're really hitting that 25% profile or algorithm margin you'd be looking for? Jack Hartung : Yes, Nicole, there's actually three things that are going on when you move from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. First, we took our last price increase around August 1. So that hit part of the third quarter. So the rest of it, the fourth quarter is going to get a full hit. We also, on a very targeted basis, we identified pockets throughout the country, and there were 700 restaurants that had accelerating wage pressures. So if you look at what our typical wages are across the country and we took that very large 15% increase, we got everybody up to $15 or more in the second quarter of 2021, we have individual pockets in these restaurants that we identified that were going $1, $2 and $3 above what the rest of the country was doing. And that's just because the labor market was so tight there. So what we did, we just tried to up the menu prices just to cover some of that, not to get our margin back. But just to try to cover some of that, then ended up being somewhere between 2% and 3% in those 700 restaurants. That's about 50 basis points or so overall to the company. And the third piece, Nicole, is we took our price increase in the fourth quarter of last year around that December 7, December 8, something like that, and that rolls off. So those are the pieces. So you'll actually see for the quarter, the pricing will bounce up a little bit before it drops back down in the first quarter. So it will move from 13% up closer to call it 14.5% or approaching 15% before it drops down to 11% in the first quarter of next year. Operator : Our next question comes from David Palmer of Evercore ISI. David Palmer : Two questions. The first one is a question on food costs that those costs are down under 30%. And obviously, that's well off where they used to be. I'm wondering if that's just all pricing net of commodity inflation? Or is there something else going on in there? For example, the fact that more is being made off the digital make line that's helping your portion sizes, your portion control or the rebound in beverages or something like that. I'm wondering if there's more than just price net of commodities and I have a quick follow-up. Jack Hartung : Yes, David, there's really -- there are two other things. One is, remember, we're pricing -- we've got higher menu prices for our delivery business. Our delivery business is about 17%, 18% of our business. And so we actually rest in charging fees. We charge virtually no fee. We charge $1 fee, then plus a small commission. So our menu prices are much higher there. So that gives you what appears to be a much lower food cost, all right? So you get a benefit on the food line. The other thing when we talk about inflation over the last two years, food inflation has been about 20%, but labor inflation has been more like 24%. So any time we take price increase to cover labor when labor is inflating at a higher rate than food cost, again, you get some of that benefit in the food cost. So that's why it's under 30%. You're right, historically, we've generally not seeing our food cost under 30%. David Palmer : And just a follow-up, whether the weakness in the low end is -- pertains to your pricing or the fact that certain customers are getting priced out or not. I'm wondering what actions you think you have in your stable of potential tactics that you can deploy to correct that? Are there -- is this something where you really dial up the CRM and start doing tax to keep people sort of in the tent and keep their -- get people back in the flow again? How do you think you'll address that weakness, if at all? Brian Niccol : Yes. I mean, look, one of the things we're definitely evaluating is how do we separate these groups into understanding their current situation. And then what do we need to do to ensure that they can still have access to the Chipotle experience. And the team is hard at work in figuring out how best to use our CRM/rewards program to be very targeted with the different cohorts that we have. Some of it is obviously the low-income consumer. Some of it is also what they're interested in, whether it's having more access digitally or having a different experience when it comes to coming into our restaurant. So -- that's one of our key tools that I think that's one of the big advantages that we have, frankly, going forward is we've got this tremendous database that we can then smartly communicate with customers so that we're giving them relevant messaging that keeps them engaged with Chipotle. Operator : The next question comes from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : The question was on Project Square and, Brian, you specifically mentioned in your prepared remarks that there is still more to do there. And I just wanted to get a sense or improvements that you could still make relative to how you're currently executing. I wanted to get a sense of how much of that is just giving the employees and the managers more time to work with the current system? I mean, is it just muscle memory that needs to increase? Or are there changes that you can make or would consider things like increasing staffing levels, increased pay, technology, what have you? Anything that you can do on your end that can, in the near term, improve some of the customer metrics that you're striving to achieve? Brian Niccol : Yes. Thanks for the question. Obviously, one of the things that has been, I guess, a breath of fresh air is we've now had the ability to get back to focusing on the basics of Chipotle. And obviously, it starts with great culinary and then it starts with great teams being trained and developing each other. And look, I think the other thing that we're now surrounding these teams with is technology to have more real-time information on the performance of the restaurant so that our field leader, our General Manager and our team knows either where there's an opportunity to be better or where there is success, let's put more energy to where that success is. The fact remains, since January, we've got roughly 50% of our field leaders are new to the company. And -- I'm sorry, not new to the company -- new enroll, right? So 90% have been promoted internally. But we've got a lot of new people in the Chipotle business at new levels of responsibility. And so that's what Project Square One's all about is making sure if you're a newly promoted field leader, you know how to do the job. You're newly promoted General Manager, you know how to do the job. Maybe you're new to our company all together at the crew level, you know how to do the job. And over the last two or three years, we've had to flex based on different regulations coming at us for how we wanted to run the restaurants. Now we're getting back to what we believe is the right way to run a Chipotle in an environment that allows us to execute our standards, our processes and our culinary. And so there's still opportunity for us to get better at it because the teams need more reps. But I think we're also surrounding them now with, I think, clarity on what the standards are as well as tools to give them clarity on how they're performing real time. John Ivankoe : And have you actually noticed any changes in your guest satisfaction scores? Or is that something that you're just trying to achieve internally? Brian Niccol : Yes. No. I mean we've seen improvements definitely in our in-store experiences. And I think that's a testament to folks getting back to the business of running the front line. We still have opportunities to get better on that digital business when it comes to accuracy, specifically. And it really that accuracy shows itself more in a delivery occasion but we're seeing evidence where we're continuing to make great progress. I think I mentioned this earlier, in our higher-volume restaurants where you have more tenured field leader, more tenured general manager, more tenured crew, they're really outperforming on all these metrics and their satisfaction scores are higher. Their volumes are higher, the turnover is lower. So we know when we get teams to stabilize have high levels of capability, we get great results. And that's what Project Square One is all about. It's just reestablishing those processes, those standards and then ensuring that people have the capability to deliver on those processes and standards. Operator : Our next question comes from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. John Glass : Brian, can you talk about the efficacy of the LTOs you're running today versus a year or two or three ago? Is this driving incremental traffic? Or is this just like a check benefit, right, as people sort of purchase these new, but you're not really driving as much in terms of new customers. I guess where I'm going with this is you're on kind of a treadmill now of sorts, right, where you have to continue to innovate to make sure that you're covering last year's promo. Is there an off-ramp to that? Do you think about ways to broaden or differentiate promotions beyond just protein differentiation into other things that might help you as you start to -- eventually, you're going to have a protein that doesn't do as well as the year ago then what? Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. Look, this is something that, obviously, we evaluate. But I don't think of our business is relying on one thing. When we are executing, like for right now, we're doing Garlic Guajillo Steak. I think there is incremental business to be had because we have better throughput, better execution in the restaurant. There's incremental business to be had because we have better digital execution. And then there's business to be had because we give people some menu variety. And then frankly, in this environment, you're dealing with some macro headwinds on a lower income consumer. So I never really think of this as -- it's just one thing to lap the prior year. I think of it as like how are we growing our brand every month, every year, every day. And that's why I think one of the advantages Chipotle has is we have these layers of business that continue to grow with us. Obviously, we've got some macro issues that we're dealing with between inflation and the challenges in the lower-income consumer. But I think our strategy still has a lot of growth in them, and it's not one is overwhelming the other. John Glass : Can I just clarify when you made the comment about traffic and the dynamic between mix and more people are coming back to the restaurants? Shouldn't that benefit traffic and maybe to the detrimented mix? I think you made the comment that, that was impacting traffic. But I would have thought that would have been a positive to order accounts even if it was hurting mix. Do you see it that way? Or do I have that wrong? Brian Niccol : Go ahead, Jack. Jack Hartung : Yes. The main mix we're seeing, John, is group size. So as we're seeing customers kind of return to more normal habits, so it's less digital more in-restaurant. And even in the in-restaurant channel, there's a slight decline in the group size. So what's happening, what seems to be happening is people rather than working from home and going with like family, for example, we're bringing dinner home for their family. They're kind of back to eating more on their own as an individual that they might be out with a group of 4 people, but they're all paying for their own lunch. So the group size across all the channels and then because there's still a shift moving from digital to in-store. The group size is the biggest mix thing that we're seeing. And that ends up meaning we're selling less burritos per transaction. So it's got a negative mix impact. John Glass : But a positive traffic impact? Jack Hartung : It does have a positive traffic impact. That's right. Operator : The next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo of Bernstein. Danilo Gargiulo : So I would like to understand a bit more whether the demand and the comp is coming from mostly new customer acquisition versus essentially like improving on the throughput in your high-volume stores. Brian Niccol : Well, so we definitely have -- as we look at our data, at least in the digital space, we have an understanding of new customers versus -- and as we define a new customer that hasn't been at Chipotle in the last year. And we continue to see that group be highly represented. Where we're seeing the most gains in frequency is what not surprisingly, our more heavy user. And so that continues to be the case -- that's one of the things I think that the digital business fit for us. If you go back three or four years ago, one of the big surprises for us is it really attracted a lot of new users. And then obviously, during COVID that ramped up quite a bit because of our digital business growing. So we continue to stay focused on bringing in the new user, but we also have an equal effort on how do we get more frequency out of our medium and heavy users. Danilo Gargiulo : Got it. And then one more question. I know you mentioned there is a comparable level of margin between the kind of small town store versus the kind of the urban store. I wonder if you can also like compose for us kind of the high-level economics. And if we were to talk about pricing versus traffic, are you seeing any major differences between the urban stores versus the small town stores? Jack Hartung : Yes. I mean just at a very high level, the small town restaurants, on average, I mean, we've had some barn burners that are breaking records in terms of sales. But in terms of as a group, all of our small town restaurants are a little bit below what our average restaurant would be, so maybe by $150,000 or so. But the cost structure is more favorable in the small town. So our margin, actually, even though it's kind of smaller volume is actually higher. The investment costs tend to be lower as well. So the cash and cash returns in these small towns are stronger than what you're seeing in a typical average Chipotle. Now if you go back to urban, urban is still, if you're talking about real central business district, those restaurants are still not all the way back. They're much better and they're outcomping the nonurban locations. But if you go all the way back to 2019, they still have not quite kept pace. And so the urban restaurants, they tend to have higher cost of doing business. They tend to have higher rents. And because the volumes aren't keeping pace with the nonurban locations, those are under a little bit more pressure. But again, they're out comping their non-urban cohorts. So we think give enough time that hopefully will come all the way back. Operator : The next question comes from Dennis Geiger of UBS. Dennis Geiger : Brian, wondering if you could highlight the biggest opportunities a bit more from a transaction perspective. The -- you mentioned kind of running slightly negative in the quarter. I mean, quite frankly, all most all brands are running negative transactions right now. And so you guys actually look fairly solid relative to the industry. But I guess in looking ahead, curious if you can just highlight some of the bigger levers that support transaction growth rest of the year and into '23. I know you just commented that it's not one thing. But just in thinking about the throughput, the innovation, dining room traffic can still improve, thinking about the macro improvement. Just wondering if there's any more detail on kind of unpacking that and kind of how you think about transactions improving again from here? Brian Niccol : Sure. I mean, look, obviously, one of the biggest opportunities for us is to make sure our restaurants are staffed and trained. And I think Jack mentioned this, we still have pockets of areas or we're still battling that very challenge. And I think as long as we have the ability to attract people and use obviously all of our benefits and purpose of the brand. But at the end of the day, you have to make sure the wage is attractive and retain people. So the ability to keep these restaurants staffed, have the teams fully trained and then executing against our standards, I think there is a lot of transaction opportunity in that, both on the frontline as well as in the digital business. And doing both of those things really well. I know there is upside in the business going forward. I think we've made tremendous progress coming out of kind of the COVID challenges and then coupled with the labor challenges and the inflationary environment. So we're in a position of strength, but I think we can be a lot stronger and better going forward and that will manifest itself, I think, in some additional transactions in a tough environment. That's why you hear us talking about, hey, look, we've got to treasure every guest because we got to get it right, because it's going to be a tougher environment for the consumer going forward. So that's a big opportunity without a doubt. And then obviously, we'll continue to take advantage of our CRM tools, our marketing capabilities to continue to keep people engaged and hopefully loving the brand so that they want to come as well. The other thing I should mention, too, is we're going to open a lot of restaurants in the fourth quarter. just the fact that we're going to be opening more restaurants gets us more new users and gets people to have more experiences with Chipotle, which continues to build on itself a positive kind of vibe for a growing vibrant brand. And people like to work there, people like to eat there. So we're going to keep pushing that path forward too. Operator : The next question comes from Sara Senatore of Bank of America. Sara Senatore : I wanted to just ask a little bit about your customer base. It's kind of a two-part question. The first is that among -- in smaller towns, you're talking about kind of lower volumes. Typically, I think of those as a slightly lower income cohort, but we spent a lot of time talking about low-income consumers. So I just wanted to see if you could kind of reconcile those and whether this means something different about your value proposition in small towns. And then the other piece is just thinking about your marketing campaigns and emphasizing athletes and gaming. Could you talk a little bit about who your customer is? It seems like it's mostly targeting younger men, although I'm either young nor a man, so I can't speak to that from personal experience, but maybe just talk about those two components. Brian Niccol : Yes. Well, look, the first piece, just on the consumer. We continue to overindex with young people. It's pretty evenly split between males and females. We do have a little bit of a skew towards higher income. But when we talk about that SKU, we're really talking about north of $75,000. And we want to be showing up in the places that are a part of culture. So I mentioned Roblox, which is obviously a Metaverse type initiative. I mentioned athletes, which is, I think, just another way of talking about selecting the right nutrition for the performance you want to achieve. So you got to think about these things as like how do you make sure you're staying relevant in culture and how do you both follow culture and then at times lead culture. And that's what we want to be doing. We know there's a lot of power in being with young people, and we're always going to be figuring out ways to stay young. That's not to say that we don't have all age groups eating at Chipotle. We do. But we like the idea of having a position of strength with call it, the teen to 20s and then also a position of strength with the higher income cohorts. So that serves us really well. That's going to be some of this continue to be a position of strength. As far as small counts go, I mean, we're seeing tremendous success in these small towns. And that's why I think it's important to remind ourselves when we're talking about higher income, we're talking about $75,000 or higher as an overindexing. It's not to say that we don't have people that earn less than $75,000 coming to Chipotle as well. And I think when you demonstrate great culinary, great ingredients, great speed, great customization and people decide how am I going to spend my $10. It's hard to beat Chipotle in that equation. So I think that's why we continue to have units open very successfully, small town, urban, suburban. We're having a lot of success as we open new units, and we're continuing to have a lot of success within the four-walls of the units that we currently have opened. So we like the composition of our customer, and we like the economics that come with it. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Charles of Cowen. Andrew Charles : Brian, I wanted to come back to your comment on the layers of business you're evaluating. And I know you noted continued confidence in Chipotle strong value offering, but with greater concern around the lowering consumer and your concerns on the consumer in the coming months from a macro perspective. Could we see this manifest in focusing more on the snacking occasions or perhaps offering more value during shoulder periods when restaurants are underutilized? And then I have a follow-up question. Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, I mean what we've really spent a bunch of time on is looking at what happened in the last kind of recession or slowdowns. And the good news for us is, yes, you had some low-income consumers step away, but we also had higher income consumers trade into our business. And then as economics improved, all cohorts came back to the business in a big way. So we didn't lose those that came in and we regained those that unfortunately got hit by some tough economic headwinds. So we're not going to be chasing with discounting in the traditional sense. We are going to use targeted CRM initiatives that we know get a great return and also play a meaningful role in the consumer that receives that message. So we've seen it work in the past. We believe it will work going forward. And I think, the key thing for us to do through this whole period is execute our basics really well. That's our strongest point of differentiation. Our strongest point of differentiation without a doubt is our culinary, our ingredients, our customization and our speed. We do those things really well, we'll be rewarded with people's business. Andrew Charles : Very helpful. Jack, just with October disclosure running around mid-single-digit comps. Can you talk about the scenario where you would hit the high end of 4Q same-store sales? The entirety of that driven transactions were to accelerate? Or is there a scenario where you'd look to take pricing in December similar to past years practices? Jack Hartung : No. Andrew, when we provided that guidance, we did the -- basically, the analysis and the forecast, it's really all about Brisket. The idea here is that we've got Garlic Guajillo Steak through the entire quarter. And Brisket was very, very successful. But then we ran out. We ran out in mid-November. So when we look at what's going to happen in the second half of November and then as we move into December, those comparisons alone getting easier, give us the confidence that we can get to -- we think we'll move up. That's why we kind of range-bounded the guidance from the current trend we're running today, which is mid-single digits, up to high single digits because we do think that easing of comparison is going to lift our comp. But we don't have any incremental pricing into that guidance. Operator : The next question comes from Jon Tower of Citi. Jon Tower : Two questions, if I may. First, Jack, I was wondering if you could talk about the total cost basket or buckets that you're looking at for 2023. Obviously, right now, we're seeing some commodities come off the boil and food prices are more favorable than where they were just a few months ago. So I'm curious how you see those persisting into 2023. And then more importantly, on the labor side of the equation, how you see that playing out 2023 versus 2022? Jack Hartung : Yes. It's tough to predict. I mean, in the last year, if you took a look at anybody's crystal ball, nobody really had this figured out and a place just kept coming and coming and coming. It does seem like things are getting closer to stable right now. The areas that I would say there is more upward pressure would be in terms of beef, in terms of our cooking oil. I mean that's still significantly affected by the situation going on in Ukraine and Russia because so much of the oil that we use comes from that area. And then tortillas as well is another area that we're concerned about. Chicken, we feel pretty good about. We do have contracts for chicken. And so we feel good about that. Paper and Packaging, that's driven significantly by the cost of freight because most of the packaging comes from overseas, from Asia. And it looks like some of the crazy freight costs that we've been paying in the past are easing. Dairy has been elevated, and so we're optimistic that there will be some additional supply into next year. So there's kind of some pluses and some minuses. Overall, what we're hoping is for mostly stabilization. So if some of the softening in commodity costs can offset some of the pressure we're seeing, especially in beef and cooking oil, and if we could break even for a while and not have to see either margins degrade or have to consider another price increase, that would be fantastic to be in that position for a while. Jon Tower : And then just on labor? Jack Hartung : Labor is unpredictable because we thought it was settling into this normal kind of mid-single-digit range, and that's what I'd like to say. And yet as we did analysis, we found these 700 restaurants. So it's about 1/4, a little more than a 1/4, a little less than 1/4 in a restaurant that we're having to take $1, $2, $3 increase in starting wages just to make sure that the restaurants were staffed. So with what the Fed is doing, you think that the higher interest rates is going to have an impact on the labor market. And so that would be good news in terms of access to labor. But it's a bit of a well cut. Right now, if I had to put a stake in the ground. I would say the inflation expectation would be kind of mid-single digit but there's going to be a caveat to certain pockets throughout the country that we're going to have to do what we have to do. To Brian's point, to make sure those restaurants are staffed. We can train people and we hold on to them once we get to my board. Jon Tower : Great. And then just on the comment regarding return to or a chance to get the 10% unit growth over time. I know in the past that the big governor of growth has been human capital, it doesn't sound like that's necessarily the problem any longer. It sounds like it's more related to development headwinds on equipment, construction material, et cetera, and construction labor challenges. So what sort of lead time do you have on that potentially improving? Meaning, how quickly could you ramp that growth if you started seeing, say, all of those things improve? Jack Hartung : Yes. I mean, the inventory is there. So we've got inventory right now that could get us close to, if not all the way to that 10%. But what's happened is two, 2.5 years -- like before the pandemic, we can open up a restaurant from the time that we go see a site, we like the site, we start serious negotiation to when we get that restaurant open, it could be a 14- or 15-month period. We're now looking at 20, 21, 22 months. So I mean it's a significant increase, and it's because of all the factors that I mentioned in my prepared comments. So the biggest challenge we've had is, frankly, supply. I mean, if it's components, for example, for a walk-in cooler or the HVAC, you can't get the restaurant open. There's just no chance of doing that. So if we see some easing in the supply chain for the materials and the components that we need for the restaurant, that all by itself could knock off a couple of months. But then there's also construction labor. There's also permitting. And so we really need kind of all of those things are themselves. But our ability to get the restaurant to open on more of the time line we saw a few years ago was there as long as the rest of the piece is falling into place. Operator : The next question comes from Jared Garber of Goldman Sachs. Jared Garber : Brian or Jack, I wanted to just get an update maybe on some of the labor and efficiency tools. I know you talked about it a little bit earlier, but I think on the last call, you had given some more specific updates on the throughput where you are sort of today versus where you were maybe historically and during your peak throughput years. So if you could give us an update maybe on where you are on that and how you see that going forward? And maybe a time frame of how you expect or when you expect maybe to get back towards those pre-food safety levels? Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So right now, we're running in kind of the low 20s on that [max 15th] measure that we've been talking about. The thing that's nice to see though is in our higher-volume restaurants. Those guys are running now in the high 20s. So if you go back to like 2019, we think there's a real possibility for us to get the entire system in the mid- to high 20s. And then obviously, as we've talked about this many times, when that starts happening, everything around it starts going up too. And -- so that's what we're after. That's why we're making sure that we've got these restaurants staffed. They're getting trained and that the culture is focused on the standards and the processes that we know result in great throughput, which ultimately means great experiences for our guests. Jared Garber : And I guess, if I could just follow up, is there a way to maybe frame how -- what the traffic trends look like in some of those higher volume stores where you're seeing better throughput versus those lower volume stores just to contextualize it a little bit better? Brian Niccol : We'll just check. We've said every like 4 points, 5 points. Jack Hartung : Every five transactions gets you a point of comp. Brian Niccol : Every five transactions -- there it is. Every five transactions is a point of comp. So that's the way to think about it, Jared. Jack Hartung : Yes. And Jared, the higher-volume restaurants, they have not just higher volume, they tend to out comp. They tend to be much more predictable. But to Brian's point, they tend to also have more tenured management teams, more tenured crew. So they don't just have the reps in a few of the team. I mean the entire team has been attacked or been with Chipotle for quite some time. So that's why we're pretty confident that if we can get all of our new folks from field leader through the management ranks and into the crew, just get them more reps and more experience. They gain a lot of confidence. They gain skill, and we know the throughput numbers are going to go up. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and CEO, Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Brian Niccol : Okay. Yes. Thank you. And thanks for all the questions. I appreciate all the conversation on pricing and value. Obviously, it's front and center for us as we navigate kind of the most recent challenges. The one thing I just want to reiterate is the proposition as it relates to value for Chipotle remains very strong, no matter how you look at it. Whether you look at it on a relative basis to what's competitive pricing look like or you look at it to alternatives like with the grocery store, whether you look at it how new units are opening and how we're performing on that front. But we continue to demonstrate in all areas that the Chipotle brand is strong, and we continue to have a really strong value proposition. The other thing I just want to emphasize is the focus on having our restaurants staffed, trained and executing against the standards that we know provide a great experience for our customers and our employees is what Project Square One is all about. And the teams are focused on achieving it, which we know then will result in better throughput better experiences for everybody involved. So the combination of, I think, these five strategies we've talked about with the focus on Project Square One and keeping a close eye on our value proposition, I think, sets us up for a very long runway of growth, and we couldn\u2019t be more excited about where our future is headed. And obviously, we'll deal with the headwinds accordingly. So thanks for everybody for taking the time. And we'll talk to you next quarter.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Olsen, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead. Cindy Olsen : Hello, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements. Our discussions today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer; after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian Niccol : Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another year of strong results in 2022, expanding AUVs and restaurant-level margin despite facing one of the highest inflationary periods on record and an uncertain macro environment. These results demonstrate Chipotle's resiliency driven by our talented teams, delicious food made fresh daily, convenience, customization, and of course, our tremendous value. For the year, sales grew 14% to reach $8.6 billion driven by an 8% comp. Digital sales represented 39% of sales. Restaurant-level margin was 23.9%, an increase of 130 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $32.78, representing 29% growth over last year, and we opened 236 new restaurants, including 202 Chipotlanes. Turning to the fourth quarter. While we are pleased with our overall growth, our results were impacted by a few factors that were unique to the quarter, including a lower-than-expected benefit from garlic guajillo steak and a headwind from loyalty accounting. For the quarter, sales grew 11% to $2.2 billion driven by a 5.6% comp. In-store sales grew by 18% over last year. Digital sales continue to represent 37% of sales. Restaurant-level margin was 24%, an increase of 380 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $8.29, representing 49% growth over last year, and we opened 100 new restaurants, including 90 Chipotlanes. Our transaction trends improved throughout the quarter as we lapped brisket, and I'm pleased to report that our underlying trends have further improved entering 2023, with transaction trends turning positive. For the first quarter, we anticipate comps in the high single-digit range. Our focus on getting back to the basics and running great restaurants is beginning to pay off, and we plan to further emphasize this in 2023. Additionally, we will continue to build upon our five key strategies that will help us to win today while we create the future. Now let me provide an update on each of these strategies, which include : number one, running successful restaurants with a people-accountable culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; number two, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level; number three, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants and support centers; number four, making the brand visible, relevant and loved to improve overall guest engagement; and number five, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings. Beginning with our restaurants. As we discussed on the last call, Chipotle is a restaurant business with high standards, and it is critical that we treasure the guest and delivering an exceptional experience, including great culinary and in-restaurant execution. During the pandemic, there were unforeseen challenges, such as supply outages, staffing challenges and exclusions from COVID that resulted in a need to create workarounds. We have been eliminating the workarounds and reestablishing operational standards with Project Square One while continuing to build a culture of excellence in every aspect of our business. This means ensuring all ingredients are in stock, that our teams are fully staffed and properly deployed during peak periods to drive throughput, that our delicious food is prepped and cooked on time, that we are improving throughput on the frontline and improving on time and accuracy on the digital make-line; and of course, that we are delivering exceptional customer hospitality. Project Square One has helped to lay the foundations, including training in each of these areas. We are also bringing back more shoulder-to-shoulder training. One thing that I believe everyone has learned from the pandemic is that virtual training is not the only tool needed. So we are reducing the amount of virtual training and bringing new crew members into our restaurants sooner for on-the-job training. This helps to accelerate onboarding and gives more confidence to our new crew members as they are learning by doing. Shoulder-to-shoulder training by experienced managers is an essential process. I'm also happy to see an improvement in turnover with December being one of our best months in the past two years for both hourly and salary turnover rates. And our staffing levels continue to improve with 90% of our restaurants fully staffed. This, combined with better stability, leads to more experienced teams. When you combine this with Project Square One training for the past two quarters, positive signs are emerging across the operation. We are focused on operational excellence and have intensity and collaboration to achieve it, great people and great culinary drives performance. And speaking of great people, I'm proud to share that in 2022, we promoted over 22,000 people, surpassing 2021, and 90% of all restaurant management roles were internal promotions. And we have tremendous growth ahead. In 2023, to open our new restaurants, we will have the opportunity to promote over 1,800 hourly manager roles, over 255 GMs and over 40 field leadership positions. And these numbers will continue to grow as we expand our restaurants by our targeted range of 8% to 10% per year. As we have said in the past, our goal is to be the employer of choice. In addition to career advancement opportunities, industry-leading benefits and competitive wages, we will continue to look for ways to improve the overall experience for our teams. We know one way is to continue to invest in technology and innovation. There are a couple of new stage gate initiatives that I'm excited to share along with an update on improvements to our app functionality. First, we are currently testing a new grill to improve the overall cooking process for our chicken and steak. The grill is much faster and has consistent execution, which lowers the learning curve significantly. Importantly, we believe it maintains our high culinary standards and can cook the chicken and steak to perfection. We look forward to further validating it through our stage gate process. And second, you may remember that in the second quarter, we announced Hyphen as one of our first investments in our Cultivate Next Fund. Hyphen is a food service platform that automates the assembly of meals on the digital make-line and could help fulfill our promise to deliver on-time, accurate orders for our digital guests. This would allow our restaurant teams to focus more on our in-restaurant guests on the frontline, further improving throughput. I'm thrilled to share that together with Hyphen, we are developing our first automated digital make-line prototype, which we will test and learn on, and we expect to have it in our Cultivate center in the first half of this year. Speaking of our digital business, it is over $3 billion in revenue and represents 39% of our sales, and we're constantly looking for ways to improve the experience for our guests. Last quarter, we started testing advanced location-based technology to enhance our app functionality. For guests who opt in, the program can engage with Chipotle app users upon arrival to our restaurants and utilize real-time data to enhance their experience with order readiness messaging, wrong pickup location detection, reminders to scan the Chipotle Rewards QR code at checkout and more. The results from the stage gate process were very encouraging, including an improvement in delivery speed, a reduction in customers going to the wrong location and an improvement in the experience for our rewards guests, allowing them to quickly scan for their rewards points without impacting throughput. As a result, we rolled it out nationwide last month. Moving on to making our brand more visible, more relevant and more loved. Our Real Food for Real Athletes platform has been a success as we partner with athletes of all levels who are fans of Chipotle and focus on helping them perform their best by providing proper nutrition through real food and real ingredients. During the fourth quarter, we teamed up with U.S. Men's National Soccer Team stars, Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie to showcase their journey to soccer's biggest international tournament while featuring the athletes' go-to orders in our app. We also continue to leverage social media to remain relevant with our consumers, especially Gen Z. This year, we surpassed 2 million TikTok followers, which to put into context rival some of the largest brands in the world and we were the first brand to launch on the new social media platform, BeReal. Shifting to menu innovation. As we mentioned last quarter, 2023 will consist of one to two LTOs. I'm delighted to share that Chicken Al Pastor has been validated and ready to be rolled out in the near future. This new menu item is operationally simple to execute while still providing a new exciting flavor that drives transactions and sales. We also recently launched a new lineup of Lifestyle Bowls that cater to contemporary wellness habits of Gen Z and millennials. The lineup spans a wide range of healthy habits such as our Balanced Macros Bowl, our High Protein Bowl and our Grain Freedom Bowl. Lifestyle Bowls are a great way to show our customers that they can create balanced meals made with our existing ingredients that taste great and that they feel great eating. Turning to our Rewards program. In 2022, we increased our rewards members by 20% to 31.6 million. Our program continues to get more sophisticated as we better understand who our members are and serve them with relevant content, targeted offers and gamified badging to help drive transactions. In 2022, 60% of our rewards program promotions were personalized, and we plan to increase this going forward. To drive engagement and enroll new members, we recently introduced Freepotle, which offers each rewards member 10 personalized free rewards throughout the year. Our fifth strategic pillar is to expand access, and our development team has done an outstanding job of navigating headwinds such as material shortages and permitting and inspection delays while successfully opening 236 new restaurants in 2022, including 202 Chipotlanes. In fact, we opened 100 new restaurants in the fourth quarter, which was a record for the company. We also opened our 500th Chipotlane during the quarter as we expanded access and convenience through our unique digital drive-through format, and the performance of Chipotlanes continues to be strong. In fact, since we began opening Chipotles in 2018, our new restaurant productivity has improved by about 1,000 basis points. We plan to open 255 to 285 new restaurants in 2023 with over 80% including the Chipotlane. Within our 2023 expansion plans, we will accelerate new restaurant growth in Canada and continue to open restaurants at a measured pace in Europe. In Canada, we have built out a strong local field leadership team that works closely with our U.S. team to ensure best practices and a consistent culture, while adapting to local needs. We are now ready for accelerated growth and plan to add around ten new restaurants in 2023, which will be the fastest development growth rate since we entered the Canadian market. We also remain encouraged by the performance in Europe despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. In 2023, we plan to add a few additional locations in the UK, and we are also rolling out our digital capabilities to further expand access. We remain optimistic about the growth opportunity, and we will continue to update on Europe's progress of the stage-gate process along the way. In closing, I want to thank our restaurant and support center teams for another terrific year. Our focus on getting back to the basics is starting to pay off. Our teams are energized, and I'm excited to see further progress over the coming quarters. We have a long growth runway ahead with the ability to more than double our restaurant count, grow AUVs beyond $3 million and expand margins. I believe we have the right team and strategy in place, and we will remain focused on meeting the standards of excellence that make Chipotle, Chipotle. And with that, I will turn it over to Jack. Jack Hartung : Thanks, Brian. And good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the fourth quarter grew 11% year-over-year to reach $2.2 billion as comp sales grew 5.6%, which included about an 80 basis point headwind related to our loyalty program. In Q4 of each year, we reevaluate the estimated loyalty breakage for points that will expire. And this year, we decreased our estimate due to higher member engagement. Restaurant-level margin of 24% increased about 380 basis points compared to last year. In addition to loyalty program headwind, restaurant-level margin was impacted by a higher level of sick pay and medical claims in the quarter compared to our expectations. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $8.29, representing 49% year-over-year growth. The fourth quarter had unusual expenses related to legal expenses, our previously disclosed 2018 performance share modification and corporate restructuring. Turning to our sales outlook for 2023, as Brian mentioned, we've seen the transaction trends turn positive as we remain focused on delivering a great guest experience. January comps were in the low double digits. For Q1, factoring in momentum we've seen quarter-to-date as well as tougher comparisons as we move through the remainder of the quarter, we anticipate comp sales to be in the high single-digit range. While it's difficult to forecast comps for the rest of the year, considering economic uncertainty, including the possibility of recession, we expect comps to moderate as we lap menu price increases in early Q2 and the middle of Q3. I'll now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 29.3%, a decrease of about 230 basis points from last year. The benefit of menu price increases and lower avocado prices offset elevated costs across the board, most notably in dairy, tortillas, beans, rice and salsa. In Q1, we expect our cost of sales to be in the high-29% range due to higher prices across several items, including queso, salsa, spices and oil. Labor costs for the quarter were 25.6%, a decrease of about 80 basis points from last year. The benefit of sales leverage was somewhat offset by wage inflation in addition to higher-than-expected sick pay and medical claims. For Q1, we expect our labor cost to improve slightly, but remain in the mid-25% range, due to seasonally higher employee taxes as employee taxes start the year at an elevated level due to resetting of wage caps. Other operating costs for the quarter were 15.7%, a decrease of about 60 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven by a decline in delivery expenses due to lower delivery sales as well as sales leverage, partially offset by higher costs across several expenses, including natural gas and maintenance and repairs. Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 3.4%, 20 basis points below last year. In Q1, we expect marketing costs to be in the mid-3% range with the full year to come in around 3%. In Q1, other operating costs are expected to be in the low 15% range. G&A for the quarter was $135 million on a GAAP basis or $129 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $4 million in legal expenses, $1 million related to the previously disclosed modification to our 2018 performance shares and $1 million related to transformation expenses. G&A also included $119 million in underlying G&A, $18 million related to noncash stock compensation, which includes a reduction in the estimated payout levels of our performance-based stock awards and was offset by $8 million reduction in performance-based bonus accruals. We expect our underlying G&A to be around $121 million in Q1 and continue to grow slightly thereafter as we make investments in technology and people to support ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will be around $25 million in Q1, although this amount could move up or down based on our performance and is subject to the 2023 grants, which are issued in Q1. We also expect to recognize around $7 million related to employer taxes associated with shares that vest during the quarter and $2 million for costs associated with our field leader conference in February, bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q1 to around $155 million. Depreciation for the quarter was $74 million or 3.4% of sales. And for the full year 2023, we expect it to inch up slightly each quarter as we open more restaurants. Our effective tax rate for Q4 was 26.3% for GAAP and 25.1% for non-GAAP. And for 2023, we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items. Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt, along with a $500 million untapped revolver. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $199 million of our stock at an average price of $1,487. And we repurchased a total of $827 million in 2022, which was the largest amount ever repurchased in a single year. We increased our level of stock repurchases during the quarter when our share price fell with the market overall, and we'll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock. During the quarter, our Board authorized an additional $200 million to our share authorization program and at the end of the quarter, we had $414 million remaining. We opened a record 100 new restaurants in the fourth quarter, of which 90 had a Chipotlane. And we remain on track to open 255 to 285 new restaurants in 2023 with at least 80% including a Chipotlane. Development delays remain a headwind, including utility installations, permitting and inspection delays, construction, labor challenges, and component and raw material shortages. While we expect these challenges to persist into 2023, our pipeline remains strong, and we expect to move toward the high end of the 8% to 10% openings range once these headwinds subside. To conclude, we're off to a strong start in 2023 with early signs of progress from our focus on getting back to the basics of running great restaurants and treasuring our guests. While we cannot predict how the macroeconomic environment will play out over the next 12 months, we will continue to strengthen our operations and work hard to earn each and every customer visit. I want to thank our restaurant teams and our restaurant support teams for all their hard work this year and for their commitment to Chipotle. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from David Tarantino from Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi. Hi, good afternoon. I have a couple of questions about your commentary on traffic trends. I think Brian, you mentioned that underlying traffic trends have turned positive if I heard that correctly. So I'm wondering what you meant by the word underlying if you're making some adjustments to that. And I know January had a lot of puts and takes with respect to the comparison against Omicron last year, and then perhaps we had some favorable weather this year. So I'm wondering, it seems like you're linking some of the traffic progress towards some of your internal initiatives. And I'm wondering how you're adjusting for some of the factors that maybe were outside your control. Brian Niccol : Yes. So, first of all, underlying just means transactions. There wasn't anything there. So, thanks for asking for the clarity. And basically, what we saw is as we exited the quarter, our transactions turned positive, and then we saw that continue to build in January. You are right, there was some Omicron and then there were some good weather. But what we've also seen is our staffing is at the best it's been. Our turnover is at the best it's been in two years. And I think the combination of focusing on the basics, meaning no menu deactivations, keeping the lines open, both our frontline and digital make-line from open to close, teams deployed correctly, is also a key driver in why we're seeing the traffic progress in January throughout that whole month. So we're feeling good about where we are operationally. We believe we can still get even better as we get closer and closer to our infamous burrito season. But it's a great position of strength that we're walking forward from. And we like how we exited December and we like how January shaped up. David Tarantino : Great. And if I could just ask one follow-up on the operations, I'm wondering if you could maybe elaborate on what metrics other than transactions that you're focused on and how those are progressing? And what you think maybe the ultimate target for those should be as you progress through the year or maybe work towards your goals there. Brian Niccol : Yes. Sure. So I'd like to put a little color on this, menu deactivations in our digital business. Obviously, during the course of the last couple of years, we've had a lot of supply chain challenges, and one of the workarounds we created was allowing teams to deactivate certain items, right, so whether it's clock or chips or anything on those lines. And we've kind of just reestablished with both our suppliers, our distribution partners and our teams that that's not a fallback position anymore. The expectation is \u2013 I don't know. Can you hear me, David? David Tarantino : I can. Thank you. Brian Niccol : Okay. The expectation is you should be in stock, and then you should be prepared from open to close with those items. So there were points and times during that quarter where we had hundreds of menu deactivations, and now we're back into the single digits on how that's going. So that's a key metric. Another key metric would be our digital on-time percentage. That's improved by nearly ten points. And so I think that's a function again of being deployed correctly, staffed correctly and then obviously, having the ingredients you need in order to build the order correctly. And then we've seen some progress on throughput as well on the frontline. And I anticipate really where we'll see big movement on throughput is more towards the second quarter, when we get into kind of more of our peak performance, and that's why you saw us focus on hiring so many additional people. So there is a lot of good indicators beyond just the traffic trends that we've seen. I always like to start with, hey, if you got more stability, your teams are deployed correctly, they are trained correctly, and then we keep it very focused on the basics of running the restaurant, we know we get good outcomes. David Tarantino : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And the next question is from Sara Senatore from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Sara Senatore : Hi, thank you. I have a follow-up on labor and staffing and then a quick one on the new units. So just on the labor piece, I guess, could you help me reconcile? I think you\u2019ve been saying mid-single-digit wage inflation, and I think you had something like 15% price on the menu. So were those hours coming from what you were talking about like the sort of shoulder-to-shoulder drop training? Or is that 90% staff \u2013 90% fully staffed, is that a lot higher than it was? I just trying to think about as we look forward to the year if the late there should be more labor hour investments. Brian Niccol : Yes. Well, I think what we\u2019ve been referring to more often than not is just the absolute wage that we\u2019re paying and then what that inflation subsequent with that has been. The stores, fortunately, are \u2013 we keep track of an at-model metric. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re referring to, where we\u2019re closing on 90% of our restaurants being at-model. In regard to the shoulder-to-shoulder training, that\u2019s just part of our process. And I think there was an element at some point where we\u2019re maybe getting too reliant on virtual training versus the shoulder-to-shoulder training, meaning our field leaders, our team directors also need to be in the restaurants doing shoulder-to-shoulder training with our general managers and our new crews. So that should not result in any additional labor cost with having more shoulder-to-shoulder training. But Jack, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything you want to add to that. Jack Hartung : No. No, I think that\u2019s right, Sara. And we don\u2019t think we need to have incremental investment in labor for the training, because the best training is, you put your teams in position. You have somebody that\u2019s chosen what to do and you have somebody that\u2019s watching them to kind of self-correct along the way. So it shouldn\u2019t be extra labor per se. Now when we hire 15,000 people, there\u2019s going to be some additional training. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be anything that you\u2019ll see will blow up the labor line on the P&L going forward at all. Sara Senatore : Okay. So, just as we\u2019re thinking about kind of the labor, there\u2019s still room, I think, what you\u2019re saying for improvement on just the restaurant-level margin line is the new comp? Jack Hartung : Yes. Definitely. Sara Senatore : Okay. And then just quickly on the new store productivity. Could you clarify that sort of there, it\u2019s 1,000 basis points better? Is that because the Chipotlanes open at higher volumes than non-Chipotlanes, and so it\u2019s just sort of comparing the different models? Or is there something else going on where across the board, new store productivity is better? Thank you. Jack Hartung : Yes. Sara, I\u2019ll take this. I think it\u2019s really more based on the Chipotlanes. Because if you look over the last four years or so, you got to look over a longer period of time to look at all the opening, we\u2019ve moved up our productivity. So for example, today, our restaurants open up on average around 85% of what our existing comp stores are doing. If you look back three years or four years ago, we were in kind of the high 70% range or so. So there\u2019s been a step change. And the biggest thing that\u2019s happened from the three years, three and a half years ago to today is we\u2019ve moved from having just a handful of Chipotlanes to having the majority of our portfolio is Chipotlane. And we still \u2013 when we look at what our Chipotlanes are doing, the 85% compared to 15% without a Chipotlane, they continue to outperform that non-Chipotlane cohort. So, we think the main driver is the Chipotlane and the convenience that our customers find with that digital drive-through. Sara Senatore : Thank you so much. Operator : The next question will be from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. I wanted to ask a question about digital orders. I\u2019ve been somewhat surprised by the level of decline there. I think back in the third quarter, we estimated that digital traffic per store decline in the mid-teens. That\u2019s including both delivery and pickup. Maybe you can comment on where you think that was correct, but also how much you think digital traffic per store declined in the fourth quarter. And just relatedly, what are your thoughts about that channel? I know it\u2019s important to you. What\u2019s your outlook for it? And are there things you can do to stabilize that line? Thanks. Brian Niccol : Go ahead, Jack. Jack Hartung : Yes. I\u2019ll get started, David. Listen, there\u2019s a couple of things that are driving it. One is, we\u2019re having a surge in return to in-restaurant. And so that part of our business is growing very, very healthily throughout the last year and a half or two years since we\u2019ve been moving away from the pandemic. But secondly, delivery has been declining as well. Delivery transactions in the fourth quarter declined 15%, and that\u2019s I think just again a normal kind of move away from people getting out and about. And I think there\u2019s probably some people who are deciding that while that channel adds a lot of convenience, there is a higher price that comes with that. So those are the two main drivers. And we figured that digital would kind of settle in this high 30% range. And so we\u2019re at 37% range now. So it\u2019s within the range that we thought we would be in. And early on in the pandemic, we saw our two markets that were the least affected, that\u2019d be the Southeast and the Southwest. When they were starting to normalize, they were normalizing towards that high 30% range. So it feels like about the right range for us. David Palmer : So is your view that you\u2019re going to start to kind of lap the second quarter, things really step down? Or do you think you\u2019re going to enjoy that comparisons when it comes to digital orders and start to stabilize on that channel, and then perhaps enjoy some of the benefits you\u2019re talking about with throughput on the front make-line? Is that \u2013 is your belief that you\u2019re going to get a dual benefit there? Brian Niccol : Yes. That\u2019s right, David. I mean the way we think about it is, we feel like we\u2019ve reset the delivery business to be now where it makes sense economically. And as such, our order-ahead business, I think, has started to show the right trajectory. And then obviously, our in-store business has shown tremendous acceleration. So, I think you said it well. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Charles from Cowen. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles : Great. Thanks. Jack, I have two margin questions for you. There\u2019s obviously a lot of noise in 4Q. Labor cost was 1Q guidance for labor. And I\u2019m curious what the impact of higher expected sick claims have in 4Q. And then I missed the term, but there\u2019s some external factors that you\u2019re betting within the mid-25% labor margins. Can you just help tease us out in terms of what that impact is from that external factor? And then my real question is that if we zoom out and fast forward to when you get the $3 million sales volumes, what\u2019s your level of confidence in achieving 27% restaurant-level margins relative to what you might have said a quarter ago if the sales structure has obviously been up and to the right and you\u2019re rapidly getting towards that target? Jack Hartung : Yes. So let me start with the fourth quarter. Our expectations were that our margin would be more in the 25% range rather than the 24% range. And when you look at the pieces of how we got down to 24%, part of it was the loyalty breakage. Frankly, there was an 80 basis point change year-over-year in the comp related to just that journal entry that we had to book for the breakage. If you look at just the \u2013 there was 30 basis points of additional or reduced breakage that we had to reflect this year, that cost us 20 basis points on the margin. It was 60 basis points on \u2013 we saw higher-than-expected medical claims and sick pay during the quarter as well. We typically do see those things pick up a little bit in the fourth quarter and especially in December. But it \u2013 the surge was more than we expected. That\u2019s not something that we would expect to recur. And then sales softened during December as well. I think that went hand-in-hand with softer retail sales. We know there was some weather and a seasonal shift in the holidays and things like that. And that was 20 basis points, 30 basis points or so. So, we look at that margin in the fourth quarter. And we think if those things normalize, there is as much as 100 basis points or so that we can get back. We don\u2019t get it back all at one time, but we definitely think we have the potential to do that. So with that in mind, if you\u2019re looking at more of that high 24% and that 25% range on a normalized basis, then we are confident that as we move from the current volumes on a menu price-adjusted basis just over 20 \u2013 $2.7 [ph] million up towards that $3 million, the flow-through that we know our model provides will still get us to that 27%. Andrew Charles : And can you just clarify \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, you said sales were a bit softer than you guys expected in December. But I think earlier in the script, you guys talked about how there was improvement through the quarter. So was that just a reflection that December didn\u2019t perform to the level that you guys were really expecting? Jack Hartung : Yes. I mean, listen, the way I would describe the quarter, we started out soft and we talked about that in October that we were doing a mid-single-digit comp, that GGS, while there was an attachment rate that was as expected, it wasn\u2019t driving transactions. So, we started out soft in the quarter. We picked up as we stopped comparing against brisket. That was in the middle of November. So we had, call it, high single-digit comps for a while. And then we lapped the menu pricing increase from December of 2021. And then just as we got around the holiday, we just didn\u2019t see that pop, that momentum that we normally see in \u2013 so December. So the way I would describe it is, frankly, we started the quarter soft and we ended the quarter soft. Now what we\u2019re happy about is, as the holidays \u2013 we got through the holidays and we got into January, that\u2019s where our transaction, not just from a comparison standpoint but just on a trend month-over-month, really did improve. And so we feel good about where we go from here. But yes, listen, the fourth quarter was a tough quarter for us. Andrew Charles : Thanks for the color Jack. Operator : Next question will be from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer & Co. Please go ahead. Brian Bittner : Thank you. Thanks for the question. As you move throughout 2023 and you lap some of these large menu price increases as the year progresses, would you think about replacing them with some type of increases, albeit probably a lot more normalized, more lower price increases? Or do you plan to let these fully roll off? And Jack, as you sit here today, what do you anticipate the total pricing factor to be for the full year 2023 for the same-store sales model? Jack Hartung : Yes. So, I mean I\u2019ll start with that and then we can talk about expectations. We\u2019re running right now in that kind of 9% to 10% range. And as I mentioned, it rolls off early in Q3. And then in \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, early in Q2 and mid-Q3. And then there were a couple of delivery adjustments, target adjustments in there as well. We\u2019ll end up being somewhere in that kind of mid-single-digit because by the time you get to the end of the year, we\u2019re running basically zero pricing. So overall for the year, it will be somewhere in that kind of mid-single-digit. In terms of pricing action, we're not going to take a price increase just to cover a lap over last year. The main thing we're going to do is we're going to want inflation, and we're going to hope that inflation is tame. Right now, we know that there is some pressure on a few of our ingredients. Beef is the one that we keep hearing about. We haven't seen it yet, but everyone is predicting that there's going to be greater supply versus demand. But we'll watch that carefully and see what inflation does. But it's going to be more about inflation and wages, inflation and ingredients and do we need to take pricing action to cover some of that, but I \u2013 we wouldn't take a price increase just to cover a comp lap. Brian Bittner : That makes sense. And just a clarification on the same-store sales guidance for the first quarter. I know you've talked a lot about traffic flipping positive here in January. But if we just hypothetically land in that high single-digit range for the first quarter, what do you think mix and traffic would separately be in that build if it kind of played out how you thought? Jack Hartung : Yes. I mean, right now, we're running, call it mid-single-digit positive traffic. We expect for the quarter, that guidance range assumes that we're also going to be positive transactions more in the low-single-digit as we move away from Omicron. Pricing will be that 9% to 10% range that I mentioned. And then there's going to be a mix component. We think it's kind of probably be in that low maybe 2-ish, 3-ish percent something like that. Mix is a little harder to predict, but those are the main components. Brian Bittner : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question will be from Jon Tower from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Jon Tower : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Quick clarification on the question. On the new store productivity, I know we talked on this a little bit earlier. During the quarter, was there anything about timing where \u2013 based on the way that we can calculate it looks like the productivity of the stores might have been a little bit lower than the normal. And I don't know if that's related to timing or something else. That's kind of the clarification. The question is then on thinking about the Garlic Guajillo Steak, it didn't live up to your expectations. Curious if you could dissect that and give us a reason as to what you might have missed. I know it hasn't been that long, but curious to know how it didn't perform versus your expectations and why you think that happened? Brian Niccol : I'll let Jack answer the first one on the store productivity, and then I can chime in on the... Jack Hartung : Yes. You hit the nail on the head. We opened a record 100 restaurants during the quarter, but it was very, very back-loaded. Our teams did a great job of just scratching, clawing and doing everything that they could to get the restaurants open. And I think we probably had a record opening in the month of December as well. We had more than half of the openings or in the last month of the year. So yes, you're not \u2013 you didn't see a typical sales flow-through, considering we opened 100 restaurants. Jon Tower : Thank you. Brian Niccol : And then on your question about Garlic Guajillo Steak. Look, I think it's one of those things where we tested it in a very different environment than when we rolled it out. And as a result, we got the check benefit, but we didn't get the transactions. And it also had the challenge of rolling over brisket, which was arguably one of our best-performing menu items that we've done to date. But we'll continue to analyze that we make sure we learn from it going forward and that's why we use the stage-gate process so that we are always learning. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will be from Sharon Zackfia from William Blair. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia : Hi. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask a question about staffing and the lower turnover that you're seeing. Is there a way to kind of compare and contrast tenure on the frontline now versus 2019? And if we think about throughput opportunity as we enter high season, I mean, how much is the frontline because it is less experienced kind of lagging where you were in 2019 or dimensionalize kind of how \u2013 how much throughput opportunity is really on the table here as you have more productive frontline staff? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, thanks for the question on this because I think this is an important one, which is what we know is when we have our teams at model and deployed correctly with leadership present for shoulder-to-shoulder training, our restaurants perform and that's what we saw in 2019, and that's what we anticipate occurring going forward. So we know there's upside in how much throughput is our teams are capable of doing. And obviously, we're targeting to get those throughput numbers back to where they were in, call it, the 2019-time-period. The one thing that's nice is our turnover levels have dropped. So we're getting more stability in the teams, which means they're getting more reps. So that as we walk into these higher-level or higher-volume months, they've got more reps and being deployed correctly, working together correctly to ensure that we get more throughput. And that's what we're focused on is the people that we have today, how do we get them trained, how do we get them deployed and then how do we make sure those teams stay together. Jack Hartung : Yes. And Sharon, just to add, when we look at the timing position back to 2019, and there's two factors here. One is turnover. The other one is promotion rates as well, but when your turnover slows down, people are going to be in their position longer. In for example on the kitchen manager, we're very close to where we were in 2019. So the average tenure in the kitchen manager role was like 0.69, meaning it was about eight months or so. Today, it's like 0.64. So it's like maybe seven, 7.5 months something like that. In apprentice, we're not quite back to 2019, but we're ahead of where we were a year ago, and we're in striking distance again. So those are areas that we were seeing that our average tenure was going down during the high-turnover period of the last year \u2013 year-and-a-half or so. But those numbers appear to just like with the turnover be stabilizing and moving back up. Operator : Thank you. And the next question will be from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you. I know you've been working on a number of different automation or technology practices in the store that could potentially reduce the demand for labor and also make you efficient and perhaps more consistent in some ways. So I was just hoping you could take a few minutes or a few seconds and just kind of talk about some of the different packages that you have. How far along they are and when you \u2013 we actually might be able to start to see some benefit, even if it's on a limited basis at a market level? Thank you Brian Niccol : Yes. Sure. So probably the one that's closest in is the new grill work that we've got going on, which I mentioned in my earlier remarks. It just gives our teams a tool that allows them to cook the chicken, frankly just perfect every time and a lot faster, significantly faster. And the same thing goes for steak. And we're actually moving that from a one-store test now to a multi-store test as we speak. So we're excited about that one. Obviously, we're working on an automated digital make-line, which is in partnership with Hyphen. And we'll get the first one of those into a real live prototype in our Cultivate center probably end of this quarter, early in the next quarter. So that one's a little bit further out. And then we just got rolling with a live pilot on the, what we call Chippy, which is our automated arm or robotic arm to fry chips. And \u2013 so I have much more information on that as that goes live in the one restaurant. So I'd say the one that's probably close in is the grill, and the ones probably furthest out probably is our digital make-line \u2013 automated digital make-line. But all these are really promising because when you can significantly reduce cook times and then make the practice of grilling chicken and steak easier, good things happen with our culinary, and that's what we've seen in the one restaurant. People are giving us feedback that the steak and chicken taste great. Our team members are giving us feedback that they love using the new grills, and so we're more consistent with great culinary, everybody wins. John Ivankoe : Thank you. Operator : The next question will be from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Please go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Thank you. Just first wondering if it would be possible to give the traffic mix price for the 4Q? And then the question is really about pricing \u2013 another one on pricing. Just curious if you believe you've seen any customer resistance to pricing levels, how that's kind of shaped how you thought about the pricing that you talked about for the year. And related to that, any kind of update on value scores, the low-income customer that you spoke to last quarter, anything as it relates to shaping your view on how the business performs into a potentially tougher macro? Thanks guys. Brian Niccol : Yes. Sure. So look, we really have not seen any meaningful resistance to our pricing, especially as it relates to our in-store experience. Obviously, the delivery channel was down, but I think that's a function of a couple of things. One, you do have to pay a premium for that occasion, combined with that the in-store experience is back and people are back out and about. So potentially, they see the convenience, the customization of coming in the restaurant and getting it on kind of their control terms. We continue to see the higher-income consumer, the individual that earns over $100,000, coming more often. And frankly, I think the same thing would have happened with the low-income consumer regardless of what the pricing was that we acted on. And we made the decision not to go chasing people with discounts. That's not what our brand is, and that's not what we're going to do. We're better off winning the value gain through great culinary, great speed/convenience, terrific customization, and we know that continues to resonate. Our value scores continue to be really strong. If you look at people that I would say are comparable that are in the fast-casual category, we're still at 10% to 30% discount. So look, I think we've made a lot of really good moves to kind of move with the challenges that we've had to deal with. And as a result, I think we're seeing stronger operations, stronger teams. And we're seeing, I think that work come out to bear in January and where we are here in February. So Jack, I don't know if there's anything to add to that. Jack Hartung : No. I think you said that perfectly, Brian. And just \u2013 I think you were looking for the components in the quarter. The components of our pricing was about 13.5%. Transactions were down about 4%, mix was down about 3%. So that gets you to an underlying comp about 6.5%. And then we had the journal entry that deals with breakage, and that was 80 basis points. So that gets you to the 5.6% comp. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thank you guys. Operator : And our next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great, thank you very much. First question is just on the restaurant margin. I know for full year 2022, you ended in that 24% range, though you talked about maybe some headwinds in the fourth quarter that brought that in below expectation. Just wondering, if you can give any specific thoughts as you look to full year 2023. I know you gave some color specific to the first quarter, but as you think about the environment going forward, your pricing perhaps rolling off by the end of the year and what you know today based on kind of the key cost pressures. And just wondering your thoughts on the full year 2023, whether it\u2019s reasonable to assume or return to 25% plus in 2023 or beyond. I know you mentioned getting to more like 27% when you hit the $3 million, but just wondering kind of on the interim what you\u2019re thinking specifically of the 2023. Jack Hartung : Yes, I mean, it\u2019s so hard and the reason we gave, some color on the first quarter, but not beyond that is we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to the economy. We think inflation will be reasonably tame. Hopefully that will come true. And we don\u2019t, we haven\u2019t made any decisions on pricing action right now. So Jeff, the way I would think about it is we\u2019re going to kind of let the year play out. We\u2019re going to do everything we can in terms of managing supply chain, managing as we recruit people we\u2019ve got to pay the wages to, make sure that, we gear up for burrito season. We\u2019ll watch how the inflation element plays out. And we don\u2019t have any plans right now to take pricing action. So we might be, more patient this year than we were last year. The inflation kept coming at us, and then we could see more ahead and we take pricing action, we see even more ahead. It doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s, at that fever pitch. So I think, you could see us being more patient this year. What I can tell you is when things do normalize, whether that\u2019s later this year or into 2024, we absolutely have at these kind of volumes, the ability to get a margin up into that 25% range on a sustainable basis, and then it\u2019ll grow from there. I just don\u2019t want to make any promises on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Just because so many things has happened \u2013 have happened in the last several quarters, and it\u2019s hard to predict what\u2019s going to happen, but I do know that our model is intact. Jeffrey Bernstein : Understood. And I\u2019m just following up on a couple of bigger picture topics. I think, Brian, you mentioned that international growth\u2019s going to be at, I think you said a measured pace. I\u2019m wondering if the headwinds, to your point about the economy in Western Europe perhaps, is the primary reason why it\u2019s measured or maybe there are other causes for concern. Anything around that international acceleration and when the timing of that might be would be great. Thank you. Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So obviously Canada its full steam ahead, right? We\u2019re opening; I think the most restaurants we\u2019ve ever opened from a percentage standpoint and probably absolute standpoint ever in Canada which is really exciting. And those economics continue to perform really well. When you look at Europe, look, the top line is really performing. And frankly, we\u2019ve been much more patient on pricing there because we want to make sure that people have the experiences with Chipotle. So, there\u2019s a lot of inflation that we\u2019re still dealing with in Europe. But look, we like what we\u2019re seeing; the good news is feedback on the experience is really very positive. Feedback on the culinary is very positive, and the most recent restaurants that we\u2019ve opened are performing really well. So, we\u2019re just taking our time with it because unfortunately, the last three years have not been normal in any way. So we just make sure we aren\u2019t getting any false positives or false negatives on any part of the business. So the good news is we\u2019ve got a tremendous growth runway in the United States that we can be, very patient with how we approach our international expansion. But look, the early signs are people like burritos and bowls and they like our culinary and they like the convenience and they like the speed. So that\u2019s a recipe for a lot of opportunity down the road. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Danilo Gargiulo : Great, thank you. So if I understand correctly, the traffic improvement you\u2019re seeing seems to be standing primarily from productivity and operational improvement also as you are moving along in 2023. But I\u2019m wondering your expectations on the demand side from consumers and in particular, whether you are seeing or expecting any trends that could be possibly offsetting the productivity and operational improvements as we are moving along in 2023? Brian Niccol : No, look, the consumer demand, especially if we use kind of our in-store experience right now looks to be there. Especially as you look at the higher income consumer, their purchase frequency has actually gone up. So, we fundamentally believe that better we operate, the better our performance will be. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got, Scott and the team have a full court press, frankly on, great people, great culinary. If we do those two things against our operating standards, we believe we\u2019ll continue to make progress on throughput and we\u2019ll continue to see the gains that hopefully, we\u2019ve experienced in the first part of this quarter. Danilo Gargiulo : Thank you. And I think you also mentioned there are some positive signs that are emerging from Project Square One. I was wondering if you can elaborate on that one and maybe like share a couple of metrics, where you\u2019re particularly proud of. Brian Niccol : Yes, look I mentioned this earlier obviously one of the things that we\u2019ve seen is a lot less incidents of many deactivations. So when you go to order online, all the products are available chips, guac, chicken, steak. That is dramatically decreased. And we know that\u2019s a big deal because when you order online, if you don\u2019t have what you want available your conversion rate goes down. And so we\u2019ve seen when we have the products in stock, our conversion rate gets back to where it should be. We\u2019ve also seen a huge step up in our on-time percentage, on-time in a meaningful way. And then we\u2019ve also already seen some progress on throughput, albeit small movement, but I think that has more to do with the time of year than a testament to the impact of Project Square one. What I also think is also really great news is we have more stability in our teams than we\u2019ve had in over two years, and we\u2019ve got more teams at model with less turnover, and I think Scott\u2019s got these teams focused on deploying correctly and getting trained shoulder-to-shoulder, so that they\u2019re ready to go when the rush shows up. Operator : Thank you. And our final question today will be from Brian Harbour from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Brian Harbour : Yes, thank you. Maybe first just a question on delivery, are you able to see in your data that those customers have shifted to coming into the stores or mobile order-ahead, or do you think those customers have basically fallen off as you\u2019ve seen that business decline a little bit? Brian Niccol : What it looks like to us is we\u2019ve definitely seen people make a shift in restaurant and then some shift to order ahead. That\u2019s probably been the biggest trends that we\u2019ve seen. Obviously the premium especially when you operate in our white label execution is one of those places where you can quickly compare, like what\u2019s the difference between ordering delivery versus ordering pickup. And that\u2019s an obvious one where I think we\u2019ve seen as a result, people they toggle between the two and then they choose order ahead. So yes, we\u2019ve seen people stay committed to the idea of getting Chipotle. I\u2019m sure there are those customers where if something\u2019s, free somewhere else for delivery, they might take advantage of a freebie. But look, we\u2019re not interested in renting or borrowing customers. We want people to be a part of the Chipotle business because the value proposition is right for them, they buy into, the food that we provide, the culinary that we provide at the convenience and speed at which we provided. So that\u2019s been a conscious choice, and I think it\u2019s going to serve us well in the long run. Brian Harbour : Okay. And maybe just a related question on kind of some of the new perks that you rolled out, the Freepotle that you launched in January. I mean, is it your view that, that drives kind of a step up in frequency or how else do you think it\u2019ll affect customer behavior? Is there any margin impact of that? And then I guess, also you, it sounds like you\u2019ve seen kind of mobile ordering stabilize, but do you want that to grow as you go into the next couple of years and do you think this can kind of be a catalyst for that? Brian Niccol : Yes, look it\u2019s doing two things. One, it\u2019s hopefully keeping more people engaged in the loyalty program. We\u2019re only what, one month in on it. And then also acquiring more people into the rewards program. And so it looks really promising that it\u2019s doing exactly what we\u2019ve want it to do. But again, it\u2019s only one month in. And what was your second part of your question? Brian Harbour : Just if you think that, that\u2019s kind of the, the next catalyst for driving greater, more order penetration. Brian Niccol : Yes, look, what we definitely know is when people are engaged in our rewards program, we get more purchase frequency out of them. And the most engaged people come through our digital business when it comes to our rewards program. So I do think the combination of, high engagement with rewards specifically around the amount of personalization that we\u2019re doing here, will result in more frequency out of customers down the road. And usually, that comes via a digital experience is where you see more of the impact from the rewards program. Brian Harbour : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Brian Niccol : Okay, thanks. And thanks everybody for all the questions and being a part of the call. Obviously, 2022 was another one of these years where a lot of unexpected things occurred. But I do think once again, we\u2019ve demonstrated the resiliency of Chipotle and the power of our food with Integrity purpose combined with the culinary and convenience that we provide. Again, we were able to expand our AUVs our margins. We had a record number of store openings in the fourth quarter. And, we\u2019re optimistic about where the business is today because of the focus on great operational execution, combined with great culinary and great people. And you\u2019re going to continue to see us stay focused on executing those basics while we continue to execute against the other strategies to make the brand more visible, loved and hopefully engaged with. So off to a good start in 2023 and we\u2019re optimistic about our growth runway going forward. So thanks everybody for being a part of the call and we\u2019ll talk to you soon, I\u2019m sure. Take care. Bye. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Head of Investor Relations and Strategy, Cindy Olsen. Cindy, please go ahead. Cindy Olsen : Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2023 call -- earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our actual results could differ materially from those projections in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire Executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Niccol : Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. 2023 is off to a great start with first quarter sales and margins ahead of our expectations. For the quarter, sales grew 17% to reach $2.4 billion, driven by a 10.9% comp. In-store sales grew by 23% over last year. Digital sales represented 39% of sales. Restaurant level margin was 25.6%, an increase of 490 basis points year-over-year. Diluted EPS was $10.50, representing 84% growth over last year. And we opened 41 new restaurants, including 34 Chipotlanes. These results demonstrate that our focus on running great restaurants with exceptional food and exceptional people is driving performance. Additionally, we benefited from exciting new menu innovations including Fajita Quesadilla and Chicken al Pastor. Transaction trends were positive throughout the quarter and the strength has continued into April. I would like to note that beginning this quarter, we are returning to our pre-COVID practice of providing annual comp guidance and anticipate comparable sales to be in the mid-to-high single-digit range for the full-year. We will also continue to provide quarterly comp guidance for the remainder of this year and anticipate second quarter comps in the mid-to-high single-digit range. Now, I would like to provide an update on our five key strategies that will position us to win today while we create the future, which include : number one, running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great food with integrity, while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences. Number two, making the brand visible, relevant and loved to improve overall guest engagement. Number three, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity in our restaurants and support centers. Number four, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings. And number five, sustaining world class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level. First, starting with our restaurants. We recently held our Field Leader Conference, which included all Field Leaders, Team Directors\u2019 and Regional Vice Presidents, as well as leaders from our restaurant support center. The message was clear. We are focused on developing exceptional people and preparing exceptional food. It was truly inspiring to see over 600 highly motivated leaders aligned to deliver Chipotle's standards of excellence and I'm proud of the progress our restaurant teams are making. We had another outstanding quarter for turnover, with both hourly and salary metrics being some of the best I've seen in five years. The stability of crew and managers and a return to shoulder-to-shoulder training is helping to translate Project Square One into results. As our teams are getting more experience, we are continuing to see improvements in each of the Project Square One focus areas, including throughput on the frontline, on-time and accuracy on the digital make line, being prepped and ready with our delicious food, and the overall customer experience. Specifically on throughput, while we are making progress, we see opportunities to do better. One area we are focused on is deployment on the front make line and the digital make line during peak periods. We have noticed that when the digital make line gets busy, our managers tend to pull a crew member from the frontline to help, which is impacting throughput. We are currently testing changes to the smarter pickup times logic based on different sales and deployment levels in several markets, and early results show that we are increasing throughput on the frontline and increasing on time on the digital make line without impacting sales. Leveraging our stage gate process, we will continue to fine-tune our testing before rolling it out in phases across our restaurants. We have also added an additional incentive for our teams as we recently rolled-out digital tipping across our restaurants as part of our ongoing effort to enhance our crew member benefits. This will enable our teams to be rewarded for their efforts in preparing delicious food and providing a great experience for our guests. Overall, our focus on being brilliant at the basics and reestablishing our standards of excellence is resonating well. Our teams love to be held to a high standard, because when you achieve it, you feel like you were part of a winning team with the ability to be rewarded through bonuses and growth within the organization. We are starting to feel this again in our culture and in our people. When operations are running better, it helps all other drivers of sales to perform better, such as menu innovation, which brings me to our brand. As we often discuss, we continue to look for ways for the Chipotle brand to be more visible, more relevant and more loved, and we had a couple of very exciting new menu innovations that did just that. We responded to a real-time opportunity to support our passionate TikTok fans, who wanted Fajita veggies and Chipotle honey vinaigrette as options for our digital exclusive Veggie Quesadilla. We worked with two popular TikTok food reviewers, who made the idea go viral at the start of the year and leveraged our strength in digital marketing and culinary to creating exciting new menu items utilizing all existing ingredients. The results have been outstanding. During the launch, we nearly doubled our Quesadilla business and had two of our top digital sales days of all time. We have decided to make this a permanent menu item as the addition of Fajitas to our Quesadilla along with dipping it in a combination of our Honey Vinaigrette and Sour Cream is really delicious. The best part is, that it is made of all existing ingredients which limits additional complexity in our restaurants and we continue to see incremental Quesadilla sales because of this launch. We also launched Chicken Al Pastor as a limited time offer. Al Pastor store has been gaining mass appeal in recent years and we tapped into these consumer trends to offer our own spicy spin on Al Pastor with our freshly grilled chicken. As we mentioned last quarter, this is also operationally simple to execute as it is our existing Adobo Chicken cooked on the plancha and then mixed in an Al Pastor marinate. This has allowed for an exciting new menu item, while still maintaining our focus on Project Square One. Additionally, this is the first time we have launched a new menu innovation globally, as it was rolled-out in the U.S., Canada and Europe. The launch has been a success, and early indications show that it is outperforming Pollo Asado, which was our most successful protein LTO ever. Turning to rewards. We now have 33 million rewards members and we saw a nice pickup in enrollments as we rolled out Freepotle, which was designed to deliver a strong value proposition and attract new members through our transaction-driving rewards program. Throughout the year, our members will receive 10 personalized free rewards ranging from a signup cloth, to a bag of chips, to a free fountain drink. In addition to driving enrollments, we also saw an increase in member engagement as Freepotle gained traction throughout the quarter. Shifting to amplifying technology and innovation. We continue to leverage technology to improve our in-restaurant and digital experiences. As we mentioned last quarter, we began testing a new grill to improve the overall cooking process for our chicken and steak. The grill is much faster, allows for more consistent execution, and maintains our high culinary standards as it cooks the chicken and steak to perfection with the same sear and char. The feedback from our teams and our guests has been tremendous and we are currently in the process of rolling out the grill to 10 additional restaurants as a part of further validation through our stage gate process. During the quarter, we also rolled out our advanced location-based technology for our app, which allows for a more seamless process for scanning rewards, as it prompts reward members to scan while they are waiting in line. This has resulted in more rewards members scanning for points in our restaurants, which drives further engagement in our rewards program. For digital orders, it also alerts app users when it appears they are ordering from or heading to the wrong location, as one of our most frequent refund request is due to guest arriving at the wrong restaurant. Since rolling out this feature, we have seen a meaningful reduction in those refunds. We are also investing in technology and innovation through our Cultivate Next Fund to help us scale and advance our Food with Integrity mission. We recently announced two new investments, including Local Line and Zero Acre Farms. Local Line is a leading local food sourcing platform connecting local producers with buyers and helping them digitize their operations and sell products. We believe Local Line will help Chipotle increase the amount of local food for our 3,200 restaurants. And Zero Acre Farms is a food company that is focused on healthy, sustainable cooking oils made by fermentation that are more environmentally-friendly. Additionally, we recently announced our new Responsible Restaurant Design, which includes features like rooftop solar panels, all electrical equipment and systems, LED lighting, Cactus leather chairs, and electrical vehicle charging stations at select locations. While the pilot will go through the normal stage gate process, we believe it will enable us to take successful elements and incorporate them into future restaurant formats. These investments and initiatives will help to further our purpose of cultivating a better world and reflects our commitment to inspire real sustainable change with a potential impact far beyond our Company. And this brings me to expanding access convenience with a long-term target of 7,000 restaurants in North America. We remain on-track to grow new restaurants 8% to 10% per year for the foreseeable future, with at least 80% including a Chipotlane. The expansion of Chipotlanes adds additional convenience by adding our unique order pickup channel, which comes with a larger digital penetration driven by the order-ahead business. In Canada, we opened our first Chipotlane in Ontario and we also expanded access and convenience with our recently-announced partnership with SkipTheDishes, which is Canada's largest food delivery network. Finally, new openings in small towns continue to be a success, with the recent opening of a restaurant in a small town in California that had the second-highest opening day sales ever. In fact, within the last year, we had our top five openings in the Company's history, of which four were in small towns. I'll turn now to sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level. Our recent Field Leader Conference was a time to celebrate the achievements and career progression of our teams and I'm always amazed by all the inspiring stories of our leaders. In fact, one of our Field Leaders from the Arizona sub region, who won the award for best throughput has been with Chipotle for 20-years. She is clearly doing a terrific job leading her patch of restaurants. However, what is even more incredible is that she has two sisters, one a Team Director, who has been with Chipotle for 24-years and is consistently a top performer in her region. And the other is a recently promoted Field Leader who has been with Chipotle for 18-years. Each has a unique story, but all three sisters started as crew members and said that Chipotle changed their lives for the better and gave them the ability to develop and grow others within the organization. When you combine our industry-leading benefits with our tremendous growth, performance culture, and then layer on top exceptional leaders, who will help to grow and develop our future leaders, Chipotle really is a special Company. In closing, I want to thank our restaurant and support center teams for all their hard work in delivering a great quarter. Our focus on getting back to the basics and reestablishing Chipotle's Standard of Excellence is beginning to drive strong results. We will continue to develop exceptional people and prepare exceptional food and of course treasure our guests. In doing this, I strongly believe we can make Chipotle better than ever. With that, I will turn it over to Jack. Jack Hartung : Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the first quarter grew 17% year-over-year to reach $2.4 billion as comp sales grew 10.9%. Restaurant-level margin of 25.6% increased about 490 basis points, compared to last year. Relative to our guidance, restaurant-level margin benefited from leverage from higher sales, labor efficiencies and lower avocado prices. Earnings per share was $10.50, representing 84% year-over-year growth. The first quarter did not have any material unusual expenses or our GAAP earnings and non-GAAP earnings are the same. As Brian mentioned, we are going back to our pre-COVID practice of providing annual comp guidance. We anticipate comps in the mid-to-high single-digit range for the full-year, assuming we do not see further deterioration in the macro environment. As a reminder, for Q2 and the full-year, our comp stepped down when we lapped the menu price increase we took in late March of last year, and we anticipate comps will step down again when we lap the menu price increase we took in early August of last year. We'll continue to provide quarterly comp guidance for the remainder of this year and we anticipate comps in the second quarter in the mid-to-high single-digit range as the transaction trends for the first quarter has continued into April. I'll now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 29.2%, a decrease of about 180 basis points from last year. The benefit from last year's menu price increases and lower avocado prices more than offset a mixed headwind from the Garlic Guajillo Steak limited time offer which ended in mid-February, as well as higher prices across several items including queso, beans, rice, salsa and tortilla. For Q2, we expect our cost of sales to remain in low 29% range. The mix benefit from the Chicken Al Pastor limited time offer and lower dairy costs will be offset by higher costs in other areas, most notably avocados. We anticipate avocados to increase from the current favorable levels, which are some of the seasonally lows we have seen in the past few years. Labor costs for the quarter were 24.6%, a decrease of about 170 basis points from last year. The benefit from sales leverage was partially offset by wage inflation. For Q2, we expect our labor cost to remain in the mid-24% range as continued labor inflation will be offset by leverage from seasonally higher sales. Other operating costs for the quarter were 15.3%, a decrease of about 110 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven by sales leverage and a decline in delivery expenses due to lower delivery sales, partially offset by higher costs across several expenses, including natural gas and maintenance and repairs. Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 3.2% and in Q2 we expect marketing costs to step down to the mid-2% range, with the full-year to come in right around 3%. In Q2, other operating costs are expected to be in the low 14% range. G&A for the quarter was $148 million, which includes $119 million in underlying G&A, $19 million related to non-cash stock compensation and $10 million, primarily related to payroll taxes and equity vesting and exercises, higher performance-based accruals, and costs associated with our Field Leader Conference. We expect our underlying G&A to be around $122 million in Q2 and continue to grow slightly thereafter as we make investments in technology and people to support ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will be around $22 million in Q2, although this amount could move up or down based on our performance. We also expect to recognize about $4 million related to performance-based bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vesting exercises, bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q2 to around $148 million. Depreciation for the quarter was $77 million or 3.2% of sales. And we expect depreciation to increase slightly each quarter as we continue to open more restaurants. Asset retirement stepped up to $8.4 million in the quarter. This includes charges related to the replacement of equipment such as fryers, grills, rice cookers and other restaurant equipment as we have been more proactive under Project Square One in preventing ingredient outages. In the near-term, we expect asset retirements to remain around this level as we continue to prioritize the guest experience and focus on great ops. Our effective tax rate for Q1 was 22.5%, which benefited from option exercise and share vesting and stock prices above the grant values. We continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary each quarter based on discrete items. Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with nearly $1.5 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments, with no debt, along with a $500 million untapped revolver. During the first quarter, we repurchased $132 million of our stock at an average price of $1,553. We increased our level of stock repurchases during the quarter when our share price fell with the overall market and we'll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock. At the end of the quarter, we had $282 million remaining under our share authorization program. We opened 41 new restaurants in the quarter, of which 34 had a Chipotlane and we remain on-track to open between 255 and 285 new restaurants this year, with least 80% including a Chipotlane. We continue to experience challenges including utility installation, component and raw material shortages, and permitting and inspection delays, which have extended our development timeline. And while we anticipate these challenges to persist throughout the year, our pipeline remains strong and we expect to move toward the high-end of the 8% to 10% of openings range once these timeline challenges subside. In closing, 2023 is off to a great start as our focus on strong operations and treasuring our guests is driving an improvement in sales and margin trends. While we are proud of the progress our teams have made in a short period of time, we recognize that there is still opportunity for us to be even better. We believe that these efforts will position us to successfully navigate through macro uncertainty and more importantly, strengthen our foundation for sustained long-term growth. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thank you and congrats on the strong results. Brian, I want to ask a little bit more about throughput and the operations opportunity. Could you all frame up a little bit more some of the gains that maybe you're starting to see over this past quarter from Project Square One and some of the other initiatives that you spoke to? And then kind of more importantly, just thinking about the opportunity from here based on initiatives currently in place and maybe even some of the technology you guys have highlighted in recent months? Thank you. Brian Niccol : Yes. So look, Project Square One has been something we've been working very aggressively for probably, I guess now we're going on almost nine months and our operators have done a terrific job. Scott and the team have really, I think, retrenched on getting back to the basics. And some of things where we make great progress on are just being in-stock with great culinary. We're experiencing too many times where we're out of guac, we were out of chips, we were out of chicken, so we've made tremendous progress on that front. We also have made a lot of progress on keeping both lines open from open to close. And both of those reasons that we've improved dramatically are driven by I think more stability in the restaurant with better training and then holding people accountable to those standards. On the throughput side of things, we've made some progress on the frontline, we've definitely made some progress as it relates to being on time and accurate digitally, but we still believe there's a lot of room for improvement. I think you heard in our prepared remarks, we're still working through I would call it better deployment in managing during peaks. So that we service the DML business effectively without jeopardizing the service of the people that are right in front of us in the restaurant. So we still believe there's a lot of runway in front of us on great throughput. We won't get the great throughput though if we don't have great stability and great culinary having both lines open from open to close, and we've made tremendous progress on those foundational elements. So really proud of where the team has moved the organization, but I'm really optimistic about where they can get to. Dennis Geiger : Appreciate that, Brian. And then just a quick follow-up on that. Just some of the tech stuff that maybe is still a little bit early days. How exciting is that for you and what that can do either for throughput, as well as maybe some cost efficiencies as we think about the potential there? Brian Niccol : Yes, no thanks for the \u2013 thanks, I forgot to answer that part of your question. So thanks for the reminder. Look, tremendously excited, that's why we're investing in it, right. These clamshell grills that we're rolling into 10 restaurants now make the job easier, make the culinary better and make the culinary more consistently better. So that's a huge win for our customer and our employees. I think I've talked about this, it makes the cooking time dramatically go down. So chicken goes from 12, 13 minutes to two, three minutes and you get perfect sear, perfect char, just really delicious culinary. So that's a big unlock for us, because the grill position is one of the hardest positions to train. So we can make that job easier and then we also free up more space on the plancha, it just eliminates any potential bottleneck for our future growth. The other thing, it's a huge exciting one for us, it's a little further out, is Hyphen. We talked about this quite a bit, which is automating the digital make line. That will enable us to be even more accurate, I think probably get a little bit faster and I think give people more consistent experiences. So, all these things are driving towards hopefully better guest experiences, but also a better work environment for employees. And then, obviously with that, I think will be more efficient in both cases. So, really excited about both initiatives. Obviously, the clamshell grills are a little bit closer in. Hyphen is a little further out. And then we've got some other exciting initiatives on making our prep easier, right, frying chips or cutting and cleaning avocados. So, we're making a lot of investment and we're going to continue to experiment. Not all of it will work, but I'm confident having innovation in this space is a big unlock for our brand in the long-run. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thank you, Brian. Operator : The next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi, good afternoon. Jack, I have a question on the margin outlook. I think based on your guidance for the second quarter and what you delivered in the first quarter, it looks like maybe the business is doing about a 26% restaurant margin for the first-half of the year or at least that's what you expect. Is that the right run rate to think about for the year at the current sales levels or is there anything maybe on the horizon in the back-half that might I guess surprise one way or another? Jack Hartung : Yes, David. In the first half, you're thinking about it right. We definitely expect our margins to step-up from here. Q2 from a seasonal sales standpoint is a stronger quarter for us. We typically see higher margins in the second quarter. We also have relatively lower marketing in the second quarter and there is some offsets like, like a little bit of inflation in the labor line, but still you're thinking about it right for the first-half of the year. What's unknown in second-half of the year is inflation. We're still thinking there's going to be continued labor inflation in the mid-single-digit. And even though our commodity has been largely tame, where we've had some pluses and minuses that have largely offset each other. We think in the second-half of the year, there is still the possibility of inflation. For example, we don't necessarily expect, we'd love avocados to remain at this level for the rest of the year, but we're being realistic and thinking that may not happen. And there may still be inflation upbeat, we haven't seen it really yet in what we buy, but there is that possibility as well. So, it's really a wildcard about inflation up. Inflation is tame in the second-half of the year, that will obviously lead to even better margins in the second-half of the year, but I think you're thinking about it right. David Tarantino : Great. And then the follow-up is about your pricing philosophy, and I don't know if Brian or Jack, you want to take this one. But I guess how are you currently thinking about your pricing as you think about the inflation you just referenced and I think now that you've rolled over the pricing in April, you're running one of the lowest year-over-year price increases in the industry. So, just wondering how you're thinking about when you pull the lever on pricing again? Brian Niccol : Yes. Hey David, this is Brain. We're staying the course on our approach to pricing, which is, if we see inflation that warrants us needing to take additional pricing, we'll take it. I think we've now demonstrated we do have pricing power. We have a really strong brand and we don't want to be in front of the inflationary environment, but we also don't want to fall behind. So, the good news is, we're in a really strong position that when we're ready and we believe it's necessary to pull that pricing lever, we can and we continue to have a really strong brand to do it with. So, we have not made any definitive plans on pricing for the balance of the year, but we're going to stay the course on the approach we've taken over the last, I'd say 18, 24 months. David Tarantino : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Sara Senatore : Thank you. A question on labor and then as a follow-up on loyalty. Can you maybe talk a little bit, labor was, I think, better than you had expected or we had anticipated certainly I was wondering if you could just talk, is that just because transaction growth was better. I don't know, if you can decompose the same-store sales for us. Is it the lower turnover? Just trying to understand where the improvement came from? And then a question on loyalty is you mentioned, kind of, improved sign-ups. I guess when I look at loyalty membership growth year-over-year, it looks like it's still kind of in that 20% range. Do you have any thoughts about how big that could be or what share of your unique customers, you're seeing members of loyalty. Just trying to understand like sort of the run rate for that as a comp driver. Thank you. John Hartung : Yes. Yes, I'll take the labor piece first, Sara. First of all, it was most of the benefit that we saw was sales driven in the quarter. We saw our transaction turn positive. We're still running menu price increase compared to last year and about a 10% range. So when you have that kind of a flow-through where transactions are flowing and menu prices are flowing as well. That was a significant benefit in the quarter. We did have some labor inflation, so that was an offset to it. And then we did see some efficiencies. So we did see, really, for the first time, the labor scheduling tool we put into place last year was really starting to pay off. And then the fourth thing I would just say is normally this time of the year as our sales begin to increase seasonally, that is the time where our labor tends to be more efficient. It tends to happen where the weather starts to get warmer, our sales start to grow and our managers are trying to keep up on the schedules, but they end up basically driving a little bit of efficiency. They always seem to be maybe a step or 2 behind. The good news is, as Brian mentioned, operationally, we feel like the restaurants ran really well, and we drove that additional labor efficiency. Sara Senatore : Thank you. And then just on loyalty? Brian Niccol : Yes, I can say on the loyalty, your question there, what we've definitely seen is we see people higher enrollments when we make it easier to be engaged in the digital system. So a couple of things happen, right? I mentioned this in my earlier remarks. The team improved your ability to redeem rewards by alerting you, so that you don't forget this can form. We also improved your ability to end up going to the right restaurant for your order, which was a big deal. That's one of the biggest misses we seem to have with customers where they didn't realize they were ordering from different restaurants than where they were intending to go. So those types of things make the engagement easier for people, which then they stay in the program. And now doing things like free Potle, Fajita Quesadilla, digital-only just attracts new people to come into that space. And that is what we want to do. We want to continue to have acquisition and then we want to dial up the personalization and make it super easy to stay active and engaged, because we know the more engaged you are it plays out in more purchase frequency and higher ticket. So we'd love to get $33 million to $40 million. I don't know where the ceiling is on this thing, but we're going to continue to push towards getting as many people involved and then work very hard to turn it into a very personalized program that keeps them engaged. Sara Senatore : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. I wanted to double-click on that labor productivity stuff. In the past you've talked about the number of orders you could do in a 15 minute block during those peak hours in the front make line, could you give us a sense of where you are now and where you think that can go realistically over the next one or two years. And then what that would mean to your sales, if you got there? John Hartung : Yes. I mean, I'll cover a couple of stats and then Brian, you can add-on as needed. First of all, in terms of the first quarter, we did push past our 15 minute max, compared to last year. So, it was nice to see as our transactions turned positive during the quarter, that we did push past last year. We actually at the end of the quarter and as we moved into April, we actually push past where we were in the second quarter of last year as well. So, we're seeing nice progress, but we're still in that low 20%s range, David. We think we can get into the mid-20%s. Mid-20% is comparable to what we were doing in 2019, before the pandemic, if you adjust for the shift in our digital business. But beyond that, if you go back even a few years before that, we don't think there's any reason why we can't get back into at least the high 20s or maybe even into the low 30s as well. Now that will take a few years, but we think that's one project that Brian mentioned, his idea of experimenting with, how can we make sure that we've got basically the labor deployment and we've got the cadence of orders coming through to the DML, to be set such that our teams can with confidence, they can run both lines without feeling this pressure to pull from one line to the other. And typically what happened is the DML, if the orders are coming through pretty high on the DML, there is a tendency to pull somebody from that frontline and I think we're basically seeing some good early results to tell us that we think there's going to be a way to breakthrough and allow our teams to really execute it out at a really high-level on both lines. So, I think that's potentially and a lot to get to some of these higher number 15 minutes throughput figures. David Palmer : And if I look back a decade, you're your labor as a percentage of sales was in the 23% area. I know a lot's changed in the labor market since then, but you're working on a lot of stuff, not just the focus and the training, but also the double-side grills and hopefully some breakthroughs with hyphen. I mean do you think you could get back there? Is that the sort of labor productivity that's possible that you can imagine over the next few years? John Hartung : It's theoretically possible. I think the one thing, David, that is different now is labor rates are much, much, much higher. And our menu pricing hasn't really stayed caught up all the way with the labor over the last few years. And in fact, the biggest move that we made in the second quarter of 2021, we basically raised wages by 15% and only a raised price by 4%. So we basically offset the dollar value of that. We didn't try to protect the margins and certainly didn't try to protect the labor line at all. So I think there's been a bit of a dislocation there. Having said that, we do have a very efficient labor model. We do have a lot of investment in technology. We do have a lot of things that I could see over time as we grow to $3 million volumes and then $3.5 million volumes. And as we really create solutions so that our teams can be more efficient. I think it's certainly possible. It's not necessarily a goal of ours, but we could land there someday. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Lauren Silberman : Thank you very much. My question is on transaction, great to see the positive transactions in the quarter. Within the mid-single to high single-digit comp guide for the year, what are you embedding for transactions? And what do you see as the most meaningful drivers of positive traffic growth through the rest of the year? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, I think the drivers for traffic growth are going to start with Project Square One. We have to have great operational execution. We staff trained, deployed, lines open from open to close and giving people great experiences. So that's initiative number one, to keep the traffic moving in the right direction. Obviously, doing things with our loyalty program, our CRM database. We continue to talk about how we're on that journey of continuing to engage with our customers at another level and we'll continue to invest in there, continue to experiment and continue to execute. And then as I've talked about these in our strategies, having the brand visible for what makes Chipotle truly unique its purpose around food with integrity. That resonates with our customers. It resonates with our team members, because it's -- our employees feel great about the food they're serving and our customers. This is the food they want to be eating. And a great example of that are just some menu innovation things that we've added, right, the Fajita Quesadilla. Right now, we're doing Chicken Al Pastor. We made the Fajita Quesadilla program permanent. And we'll continue to do menu news. I think we've talked about this one or two a year. So it's the combination of all those things. that will continue, I think, drive great traffic. And I don't want to walk past the fact that we continue to have tremendous value scores. When you look at what you get from Chipotle for what you pay relative to your alternatives. We continue to get feedback that we're one of the best. And whether you're comparing to other restaurants in our space or even the grocery store. So we love our value position, and then we love the initiatives that we've got in place. Lauren Silberman : Great. And just a follow-up on traffic. Where is it coming from? Is it primarily your existing customers, new or lapsed customers, anything notable to share in terms of what you're seeing across income cohorts? Thank you very much. Brian Niccol : Yes. I mean, formally, it's broad-based. So we're seeing new customers come in, and we're also seeing existing customers increase their frequency. So the operational focus, combined with kind of the marketing and menu innovation is doing exactly what we would want it to do. Lauren Silberman : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Charles with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles : Great. Thanks. Brian, would you be able to talk a little more about what you attribute the sales strength in March and April 2 that exceeded your guidance at the time when the fast casual industry slowed? If you had to tease it out, just -- not looking for specific numbers, of course, but just direction of magnitude. Is it the improved staffing, wasn't Chicken Al Pastor, something else that perhaps externally, we may not be appreciating? Brian Niccol : Look, I hate to just kind of repeat myself, but I'm going to repeat myself here, which is Project Square One and getting the foundational elements of Chipotle's execution back to Chipotle standard of excellence. I can't emphasize enough how important that is to have our digital make line open from open to close to have ingredients on that line from open to close, to being staffed and trained on the front line, so to get people down the line really fast with exactly what they want. I can't emphasize enough how important that is because everything then builds from there, right? Our digital personalization program builds on that. Our menu innovation builds on that, talking about a brand with purpose builds on that. And I just think a myriad of things worked really well. The Fajita Quesadilla program was received really well. The Chicken Al Pastor program was received really well. But I know they wouldn't be as powerful if we didn't have Project Square One driving behind it. So I think we've talked about this a lot, Andrew. One of the things that makes Chipotle really special is its operational ability to achieve tremendous throughput with unbelievable culinary and unbelievable customization. We got to nail that. And we have to nail it both on the front line and in the digital experience. Andrew Charles : That's helpful. And one thing I wanted to revisit as well as just the international opportunity. Obviously, a lot of the focus in the last five years has been domestically and recognizing how much strength you guys have domestically, as well as opportunities to further spread the domestic momentum and further enhance the divest momentum, what do you need to see to lean in more on international, whether it's accelerating development, you're entering new markets, potentially testing out franchising? I would love your thoughts as we think broader beyond Canada. Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. Well, I don't want to just walk by Canada. We're getting ready to expand into Alberta. We'll open probably 10-plus restaurants up there, which is like a 50% increase. So not and the team in Canada are doing a fabulous job. We're going to continue to drive that market. Specifically on Europe, Jim and the team have done a great job. Our U.K. business has got great momentum. Not surprising, there's a lot of inflation in the P&L there. and we have not priced for it because we think a lot of it is temporary, and we're still establishing ourselves in those markets. And I'm optimistic because if you can get the top line, usually, the rest worked itself out. And we're putting in place the digital system, the operational excellence, the great culinary. So I'm optimistic we're going to get there where we'll move this thing out of the stage gate process, but we're going to take our time, because we want to get it right. We don't want to just be fast. And that's what the team is after, and they're making great progress. Andrew Charles : Appreciate it. Thanks for the help. Operator : The next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you. I was hoping that if you could give a little bit more transparency in terms of especially the month of April, what's happening on the customer cohort level? I mean, are you seeing more higher-income customers come? Are you seeing some lower income customers maybe coming a little bit less or changing their order patterns? Some people would say maybe attach is a little bit lower than it used to be or the consumer is becoming a little bit more price sensitive, but clearly, that wouldn't be the case in the traffic numbers that you've talked about in April similar to the first quarter. So just wanted to -- just get a sense if there's anything kind of happening beneath the surface that you can talk about or maybe some shifting customer behaviors that actually might be positive for you longer term? Brian Niccol : Yes. It's actually two things happened for us. One, the higher income consumer continue to come and hardly came at a little bit faster pace from a frequency standpoint. And then we did see some, I would call it, recovery in the lower income consumer, still not all the way back to where it was, call it, a year ago, but an improvement from where it was over the last six months. So we've seen nice improvements across all of our income cohorts, and we continue to see great strength in the higher income. John Ivankoe : Interesting. And secondly, if I may, in terms of personalization on Chipotle Rewards, where are we in that journey? I mean, how do you feel that you're doing, are there any near-term opportunities or some near-term functionalities that you're going to add as the system continues to learn and get better on an individual customer basis. Brian Niccol : Yes. Thanks for the question. This, I think, is a big opportunity for us because we're still very much in the early days on this. I think the teams have done a great job of turning the data into action through, call it, like CRM programs. And we're just starting to tip our toe into the personalization opportunity. And I think you're going to see really kind of CRM evolve into personalization at meaningful scale. So I think there's a lot of opportunity to be had in this space. I'm proud of the work that's been done to-date and where we currently are. But I just think there is tremendous opportunity going forward. assuming we can get this personalization program, right? John Ivankoe : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Brian Harbour : Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. In the past, you've commented just on kind of delivery sales and what that looks like for the quarter? And then maybe also just kind of what the mix component of your same-store sales for the quarter was? Would you be able to provide some color on that? Brian Niccol : Delivery was still right around 20%, right? John Hartung : Like high teens. Brian Niccol : Yes, high teens. And we saw a nice strength in our digital business, a little bit of a rebound in the delivery business, more so probably in the marketplace. But we're feeling really good about how we're positioned in all those access channels. Order ahead, delivery and coming into the restaurant. Brian Harbour : Okay. And then seeing how the Fajita Quesadilla did quite well. Are there kind of other opportunities like that where you lean into just existing menu items and do something akin to that. You've obviously done very well with kind of protein LTOs, but what else could be further afield that kind of continues on that success? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, we are really delighted by how well the Fajita Quesadilla performed for the very reason you just mentioned, right? It's all existing ingredients. It required some work on the digital side of things. But for the most part, this was a really easy one for operators to execute. So the team is doing some work to figure out other opportunities like that within our menu and maybe could apply for both the frontline and the digital line. I do believe there's still a lot of hidden gems within the Chipotle menu. And I think we have the opportunity to talk about them in a more visible way. So more to come. I know Chris and the team are working through, can we find something that can perform as well as Fajita Quesadilla following those kind of requirements. Brian Harbour : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia : Hey, good afternoon. I was hoping to get an update on Chipotlanes. I think around this time last year, you gave us some ROIC metrics on Chipotlanes versus non-Chipotlanes and kind of the sales lift and digital mix component. I'm just curious now that we're a year later, how those compare the Chipotlanes versus the non- Chipotlanes? And then Jack, did you actually give us kind of what mix and traffic were in the quarter, that would be helpful to have. Thank you. John Hartung : Well, I'll do the first one -- or the second one first. And I'm surprised it didn't get asked before. So no, we provide it. Sharon Zackfia : I just thought I space it out to Jack. John Hartung : We're almost not in Sharon. So yes, listen, transactions were in kind of that 4%-ish kind of mid, low-single-digit. It's a nice turnaround from what we saw in the fourth quarter that we saw a check the net check was 7%, so that gets you to that kind of 10.9%. And of the check, it was about 10% pricing and then a 3% mix. And just as a further clarification, the 10% pricing is about 8.5% is in our in-store and our order ahead business. And then on top of that, there's a 1.5% for delivery. And then on Chipotlane, Sharon, largely the same. I mean, Chipotlane still perform higher from a sales standpoint, higher from a margin standpoint and then higher from a return standpoint. I think we have mentioned in the past, it's -- the comparisons aren't as great anymore. So in other words, a few years ago, we would open up restaurants that could have a Chipotlane, but didn't as we were kind of executing the strategy. And today, when we have 80%, 85% of our restaurants have a Chipotlane, the 15% or 20% that don't can't have one, meaning it's an urban location, it's an in-line location. So it's really different trade areas. So we're starting to see that some of the sales comparisons are getting a little bit not necessarily relevant. We're still seeing the Chipotlanes perform at a higher level, but it's a little bit like comparing an apple to an orange, but still margin return and from a sales standpoint, they're still great. It still does generate higher digital mix by several hundred basis points, and there still is a shift where delivery takes a step down from something in the high teens into the mid or low teens, and order head steps up quite a bit from something in the call it the low 20% up to the high 20s or even the 30%. So all the same kind of directional thing that we've seen, all the benefits that we've seen with Chipotlane are continuing to show up. Sharon Zackfia : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jon Tower with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Jon Tower : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Curious, Brian, you mentioned earlier in the call that your smaller market stores are coming in strong, perhaps even better than you had anticipated. So I'm curious, I know you've recently offered the 7,000-store TAM for North America. But given the success you're seeing as well as some of the new technology like the clamshell grills that you're still testing or you can heighten on the horizon, does that maybe alter that opportunity for new stores over time? Brian Niccol : I mean, look, obviously, as we get closer to that 7,000 number. We'll have a much better idea of whether or not we can grow beyond the 7,000. The good news is we've not seen any slowdown in our performance. So all the restaurants we're opening. They're opening with strength. And obviously, we look at this every year as we kind of take another look at our market planning. And the good news is we're opening restaurants in -- for Chipotle, I would say, somewhat penetrated markets, and they continue to perform really well. And that gives us confidence because then we can kind of start thinking through like, well, you start extrapolating that across the country, you could see how you could get beyond 7,000. But not ready to take the number up just yet. I love seeing great performance. It's great to see the small towns do really well. And it's great to see, frankly, the restaurants do really well in urban and are more penetrated markets. So lots of opportunity in front of us on new restaurant opening frontier. Jon Tower : Great. And just one more follow-up. Do you have any more planned LTOs for 2023? Brian Niccol : We always think through kind of something in the front half and something in the back half. We haven't definitively made a decision on what we're going to do in the back half yet. The good news is our pipeline is really strong, and we've got some flexibility. But we want to see where the consumer is, the strength of Project Square One and that will inform what we choose to do in the back half of the year. Jon Tower : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please go ahead. Peter Saleh : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I want to ask about the hyphen automation. I think you mentioned that's for the digital make line. When you're thinking about this, and I know it's still early, is this more for new restaurants? Or can you fit this into your existing footprint in some of your existing locations? Brian Niccol : Yes. No, one of the things that's great about this is it would fit in our existing locations. It's almost pull off the current line, put in the new line kind of idea, which is really exciting. Probably the first place you'd see us do it. It will be with new units just because it's easier to implement. But the good news is Kurt and the team are designing this so that it will work with our existing restaurants. Peter Saleh : Great. And then just one question on the Chicken Al Pastore LTO. It sounds like it's performed exceptionally well. Is it bringing in new guests to the brand previously haven't come to Chipotle? And is there a level at which an LTO has so much success that it becomes a permanent item? Or do you always consider it as an LTO? Brian Niccol : Yes. Well, the good news is Chicken Al Pastore has been broadly appealing. So both to new users and existing customers. The decision to make it permanent would be something we would do after we finish this LTO 1. So we haven't come to the conclusion that we would make this permanent, but your statement is correct, it's definitely performing really well. And crew member feedback is this is an easy one for them to make, and customer feedback has been really positive as well. So we did decide to make the Fajita Quesadilla permanent in our digital platform, but that's a little different than making Chicken Al Pastore permanent. So for this one, it's definitely planned to be an LTO, we'll execute it as an LTO, and then we can always revisit whether we make a permanent menu item down the road. Peter Saleh : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. The first one is on the comp guidance. The fact that you're resuming guidance for full-year. I assume that's an indication of stabilization that you're seeing maybe more week-to-week or month-to-month or your visibility -- just wondering if you can share why that has returned. And maybe what are the components you're assuming in that mid to high-single-digit in the 2Q and full-year? Just trying to gauge what the pricing would be if you took no further and what the traffic assumption is? And then I just had one follow-up. John Hartung : Yes. On the guidance, it assumes we don't take any additional pricing similar to the comment that Brian made before. Right now, we're staying the course. So what it assumes is we continue the same transaction trends that we've seen in the first quarter continue into second quarter. It recognizes that we took some menu price action last year, and those will roll off. And so that's, in essence, what we put together for the full-year guidance. And the idea here, Jeff, is that we don't know if we're going to continue like beyond the next few quarters and give quarterly guidance all the time. You might remember a few years ago, we used to give just the annual and then not talked about what the quarterly guidance is. And so what we're doing right now is we're kind of doing both for a while, and then we'll see how the trends unfold. We'll see what happens to the macro. And we'll make a decision in terms of what our guidance is going to be. But we actually think about our business in terms of a longer-term approach than quarter-to-quarter. And so we think the guidance ought to match that as well. So that's the reason for the change. Jeffrey Bernstein : Understood. And then just on the marketing front, I think you said the mid-2% range for the second quarter. I know it was in the 3s in the first quarter. I'm just wondering, just talk about the thought process around marketing, whether this is a conscious pullback for any particular reason or how you measure the returns kind of your how happy have you been with the marketing you've had thus far and the outlook going forward? Thank you. Brian Niccol : Well, we've been really happy with how the brand has shown up and the initiatives that we've rolled out on the percentages, I think that has more to do with timing than anything else. John Hartung : It's timing. It's been planned, and we tend to spend more in the first quarter first part of the year and in the back half of the year and typically to support these LTOs. Brian Niccol : Well, I think Chris here, you'd also say too, like the summer months aren't the best time for broad-based media, right? So I think that's part of the timing. Peter Saleh : Thank you. Operator : Today's last question comes from Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Jake Bartlett : Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. Jack, I had a question on commodity inflation. I was wondering whether you could kind of handicap the likelihood of deflation in the back half. It feels like there's some big chunks of poultry dairy seem to be likely solidly deflationary. Just kind of wondering what the moving pieces are in your mind, how much visibility you have? And just what do you think the chances of deflation are in the back half? John Hartung : Yes. It's not our -- it's a good question. It's not our base case. Our base case is to see modest inflation in the back half of the year. We're predicting somewhere in the low to mid-single-digits. We've been really pleasantly surprised by what's happened so far. We have had a number of miscellaneous items where we've seen inflation like some of our oils tortilla, some of our sauces and things like that, but even offset by lower-than-expected avocado cost. So that's why our food cost has been steady for two quarters in a row. And it's been a number of quarters that that's happened where we haven't seen any net inflation. So I do think it's a possibility. It depends on what the Fed does. It depends on what happens to inflation broadly. The wildcard there is if inflation disappears, you have to also then wonder, okay, what's happened with the macro economy, what's happening with unemployment and consumer demand as well. So right now, we kind of like the environment we're in right now, where consumers have jobs. They have money. They're visiting restaurants, and the inflation that we're seeing is pretty modest. So that base case that we put together and how we plan the rest of the year feels pretty good to us. We wouldn't mind inflation going down, but we'd love it if it didn't. Also be accompanied with a softness in demand. Jake Bartlett : Great. And that answer kind of flows into my next question, which was I think as you talked about the annual guidance for same-store sales, you talked about the macro environment staying as it is now. So I just wanted to kind of make sure I understood what your kind of base case is for the macro environment in the back half of the year. And should we think of the range kind of slight recession on the low end? How should we think about the macro outlook in your guidance? And maybe how you think you're positioned if we do see a deceleration in the consumer? John Hartung : So first of all, in our prepared comments, we did say our guidance assumes that there's not a meaningful change in the macro environment, okay? Because obviously, all bets are off that happens. But in terms of our outlook, our outlook does not -- our base case does not include a recession or certainly not a meaningful recession. Again, it looks like unemployment is holding up really well. It looks like consumer spending is strong right now. I mean, Brian mentioned our -- we saw softness in the second-half of last year, especially the fourth quarter in lower income consumer. We saw those consumers come back almost at the same rate as our higher income consumers. And so we see that as a positive in a positive macro sign. So we're cautiously optimistic about what's going to happen in the second half of the year. Now if there is a recession, we feel like we're really well prepared. We have -- we own all of our restaurants. We don't have any debt. So we don't have the possibility of franchisees under pressure if they have debt payments and that there is a softening of demand. And we don't feel like we have to run the business based on a quarter-by-quarter and tally. So if we need to write a couple of tough quarters here or there, we certainly think we have the financial wherewithal and we have the long-term view to do that. But again, we're cost optimistic that the economy will hold up. Jake Bartlett : Great. I appreciate it. John Hartung : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Brian Niccol : Okay. Thanks. And thanks, everybody, for joining the call and all the questions. Obviously, we're very proud of the work that has gone into achieving these results. I think I mentioned this before, Chipotle has got one of those special brands strengths when you look out there. There aren't many companies, I think, that are growing top line, expanding margins and building new units to the tune of 8% to 10%. And then when you combine that with the strength of the balance sheet, the strength of our economics, we're very confident in the strategies that we're continuing to execute we are not slowing down, though on Project Square One, and we're not slowing down on providing digital access, and we're not going to slow down on making the brand visible and loved. And at the foundation of all this when we have great people, with great culinary, we usually end up with great experiences for our guests. So we're staying the course, and we believe the strategies and these focus areas are going to deliver results for the long-term. And we're optimistic about our long-term future of getting to those 7,000 restaurants and AUVs well beyond 3 million. So thanks again for taking the time, and we'll talk to you in a couple of months, if not sooner. Thanks. Bye. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Olsen, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead. Cindy Olsen : Hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our actual results could differ materially from those projections in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire Executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Niccol : Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. The strength in our business continued into the second quarter, driven by our focus on exceptional food and exceptional people, as well as the success of Chicken al Pastor. For the quarter, sales grew 14% to reach $2.5 billion, driven by a 7.4% comp. In restaurant sales increased 16%, digital sales represented 38% of sales. Restaurant level margin was 27.5%, an increase of 230 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $12.65, representing 36% growth over last year, and we opened 47 new restaurants, including 40 Chipotlanes. For the third quarter, we anticipate comps in the low to mid-single-digit range, driven by transaction growth, as we are rolling off of pricing. For the full year, we continue to anticipate mid to high-single-digit comps. Before reviewing our strategic priorities, I want to share a few organizational updates. As a way of maintaining a healthy growth mindset, we proactively conducted an in-depth review of our business needs and organizational structure to ensure we can deliver on our aggressive growth goals for future growth. This resulted in investments in areas like development, digital marketing, and international expansion. At the same time, we also identified areas where we could better optimize our organizational structure, such as putting our end-to-end digital experience, including product design, analytics, and the customer journey under Kurt Garner, our Chief Customer and Technology Officer. Additionally, we streamlined our strategic project management process to focus on key projects and to enable faster and more efficient decision-making. These changes will further support our five key strategies that will position us to win today while we grow our future, which include, number one, running successful restaurants with a people-accountable culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences. Number two, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level. Number three, making the brand visible, relevant, and loved to improve overall guest engagement. Number four, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants and support centers. And number five, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings and laying the foundation for international expansion. Starting with our restaurants. While Project Square One is wrapping up, we have made the decision to permanently embed the program within our training DNA. On a quarterly basis, our crew members will be retrained on key components, ensuring we are always focused on being brilliant at the basics and that we never lose sight of training and developing exceptional people and preparing and serving exceptional food. Next quarter, we will reemphasize throughput and elevate our focus on proper deployment standards during peak periods, where we often only have three crew members on the front make line versus our minimum deployment of four. The fourth person, which is often the expediter, may leave the front line to help the digital make line. Our focus will be on coaching the expediter to stay on the front line and to bring together the items and in order and communicate them to the cashier as alleviating this bottleneck is critical for delivering great throughput. Additionally, we believe we have an opportunity to better optimize our smarter pickup times and deployment of labor on the digital make line during peak periods. As you may remember, we began testing changes to the cadence of orders on the digital make line in several markets to see if we could improve throughput by eliminating the need to pull a crew member from front line to help the digital make line. The good news is that in these restaurants, we are seeing an improvement in throughput on the front line and an improvement in on time on the digital make line. We will continue to test adjusting the cadence of orders on the digital make line at certain restaurants and roll out where we see the opportunity to improve the overall experience. We remain confident that balancing the deployment between the front and digital make lines along with continuous training and reps will further drive improvements in throughput. In fact, we have seen evidence this in certain restaurants. I was recently in New York at Chipotle on 50th and Park and it was a great experience with delicious food and fast throughput on the front line compared to my experience at the same restaurant exactly a year ago. The improvement in throughput was certainly noticeable as the employment of labor between the front make line and the digital make line was more balanced. Over the last year, the field leader responsible for this patch of restaurants in New York City worked with the GMs and crew members shoulder to shoulder on throughput fundamentals. During his regular restaurant visits, he also followed up with consistent feedback like reminding his restaurants to have an expo in position during peak periods. By having the proper deployment with an expo in place and the right balance between the front make line and the digital make line, throughput in his patch of restaurants improved by nearly five entrees in the peak 15 minutes as compared to the prior year. His restaurants are also outcomping his region and the company average demonstrating throughput drives performance. This is the type of leader we want to develop; one that builds a strong team, runs world-class restaurants, ensures we serve exceptional food every day and inspires our teams to achieve great results. And this brings me to our world-class people leadership. As part of our focus on developing our teams, we\u2019ve relaunched Cultivate University for our newly promoted field leaders which is a three-day training program on the skills they need to truly excel in managing their patch of restaurants. This includes developing future leaders, the foundations of exceptional throughput and culinary, why it's critical to protect our economic model and a culture of accountability. One of the most challenging transitions is from general manager managing one restaurant to field leader and managing around eight restaurants. Cultivate University is a program that will be offered each year to support our new field leaders as they make this transition to managing a $20 million business. We remain committed to hiring and developing the best people to work at Chipotle, through our competitive wages, industry-leading benefits, and tremendous growth opportunity. In fact, we are on track to surpass our 22,000 promotions from last year and create over 7,000 new jobs with our restaurants anticipated to open in 2023. We are also relaunching our successful and long-running behind-the-foil ad campaign. This campaign provides unfiltered and emotional testimonials from our team members about the impact Chipotle has had on their lives, as well as it glimpses into our daily preparation using our real ingredients and classic culinary techniques, a key differentiator for Chipotle. What better way to make the brand more visible, more relevant, and more loved than to feature our talented restaurant team members preparing exceptional food? And speaking of exceptional food, our menu innovation has been outstanding this year. Chicken al Pastor has proven to be a popular LTO with one in five transactions, including the new protein. It is boosting transactions with a strong repeat and is attracting new customers to Chipotle. It also delivered the highest positive social sentiment of any new menu introduction, and importantly, was simple for our teams to execute, which resulted in a win all around. As Chicken al Pastor wraps up in late August, we have a planned new menu item for later in the quarter. Our rewards program is another way we aim to drive frequency within our existing customer base, as our reward members come more often and spend more than non-rewards members. We\u2019ve launched Freepotle earlier this year, which was designed to deliver a strong value proposition and attract new members with 10 free rewards dropped into our members' accounts throughout the year. Freepotle has been successful in driving enrollments in the first half of the year as we surpassed 35 million reward members. With each strategic Freepotle drop, we are learning more about our customers' behaviors and utilizing those learnings to personalize future offers. We will continue to look for creative ways to drive enrollment and improve engagement in our rewards program. In traditional media, we remain top of mind at sporting events as we leverage the basketball playoffs as a high-profile opportunity to spotlight the Chipotle brand, and through our NHL partnership, our Chipotle logo was featured on the ice during the Stanley Cup playoffs. Additionally, the return of the popular Chipotle Hockey Jersey Bogo Day had the highest participation in the history of the program. Chipotle's ingredients continue to power many of the top male and female athletes on and off the field. Through our Real Food for Real Athletes campaign, we have showcased the inspiring journeys of athletes across all levels of sports and how Chipotle can help them perform their best by providing proper nutrition. Partnering with athletes and teams along with traditional media around big sporting events has been an authentic and successful way to connect the brand to some of our biggest fans. Shifting to technology and innovation in our restaurants. First, I wanted to provide an update on the benefits we have seen from the dual-sided grill, which we discussed last quarter. The new grill can cook the chicken in under four minutes versus 12 minutes on the plancha and can cook the steak in under one minute versus four minutes on the plancha. This allows for a faster recovery of freshly grilled chicken and steak, resulting in more opportunity to remain in stock during peak periods, as well as the ability to cook smaller batches, ensuring superior culinary. Additionally, the grill allows for more consistent execution with the same sear and char and maintains better moisture, resulting in juicier chicken and steak with less waste. Finally, it takes one of the most complex positions in our restaurants and significantly improves the learning curve, making it a more desirable role for our teams. The feedback from our guests and our teams continues to be very positive, and we recently completed the rollout of the dual-sided grill into 10 high volume locations as the next step in the stage gate process. We also began to do a broader rollout of our new third pan rice cookers, which eliminates our large rice pots and cooks the rice in our third pans that you see on the line. This streamlines the rice cooking process while delivering fresh, high-quality rice that's cooked perfectly to our standards. It can also make single batches, allowing for a faster recovery time, less waste during non-peak periods, and the ability to make white and brown rice at the same time. We have rolled this out to our new restaurants with plans to add it to another 200 existing restaurants this year. And as part of our Cultivate Next fund, we recently invested in [Veedu], and together we are exploring collaborative robotics that will drive efficiencies and [easy paying] points for our employees. One device that we are in the process of developing cuts, cores, and peels an avocado. It's called the autocado. This co-botic prototype saves time and eliminates a less favorable task, but still allows our teams to hand mash our signature guac. As you can see, all of these initiatives have a common goal, which is to improve the in-restaurant experience for our teams and our guests while maintaining or improving upon our high culinary standards. I'm really proud of the work the teams are doing to leverage automation, technology, and artificial intelligence, and it was nice to be recognized as one of Time magazine's most innovative companies last month. Our final key strategy is to expand access and convenience. I'm thrilled to share the addition of Stephen Piacentini as our new Chief Development Officer. Stephen has extensive experience as some of the largest restaurant brands, and will lead our very talented and tenured development team as we look to reach 7,000 restaurants over time in North America. This year, we continue to target 255 to 285 new restaurants with over 80% including a Chipotle, and in fact, this quarter, we opened our 600th Chipotle. In Canada, performance remains strong with 34 locations, and we are on track to add about 10 new restaurants this year. We had our highest opening day ever in Canada this past quarter, which is a testament to the increasing excitement around the brand and our growth opportunity in the country. We also believe there's even more opportunity on the 7,000 restaurants we were targeting longer term in North America, and we were laying the foundation for further international growth. For our recent reorganization, we added resources to our European operations, including bringing over one of our top U.S. operators to Europe to drive productivity and better align our operations with the U.S. We look forward to continued progress in Europe over the coming quarters as we aim to set up the region for long-term growth. And finally, we\u2019ve recently announced our first ever development agreement with the Alshaya Group to open restaurants in the Middle East, which will further accelerate our international efforts. The Alshaya Group has successfully expanded many of the largest global brands into the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe, and they plan to open our first restaurants in Kuwait and United Arab Emirates in 2024. We're excited to offer guests in the Middle East our responsibly sourced, classically cooked real food and look forward to furthering our purpose to cultivate a better world in this new territory. In closing, I want to thank our 114,000 employees for all their hard work to reestablish Chipotle standards of excellence in culture of accountability. Earlier this month, Chipotle celebrated its 30th anniversary of the opening of the first Chipotle restaurant in Denver, Colorado. What makes Chipotle special and has driven our success over the last 30 years is our people, our purpose of cultivating a better world, and our focus on delivering exceptional food. Our culinary, using the highest quality ingredients and classic cooking techniques, makes our food delicious. Our customization, convenience and speed are differentiators and our value is simply tremendous. This has resulted in an industry-leading brand with industry-leading economics and we still have a long runway for growth. We are well positioned to win today while we grow our future over the next 30 years. And with that, I will turn it over to Jack. Jack Hartung : Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the second quarter grew 14% year-over-year to reach $2.5 billion as comp sales grew 7.4% with over 4% transaction growth. For the third quarter, we anticipate comps in a low to mid-single-digit range driven by transaction growth as we roll off nearly 500 basis points of pricing in early August. We continue to forecast full-year comps in the mid to high single-digit range. Restaurant level margin of 27.5% increased about 230 basis points compared to last year and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $12.65, representing 36% year-over-year growth. The second quarter had unusual expenses related to corporate restructuring and corporate and restaurant asset impairments, including the closure of Pizzeria Locale. I'll now go through the key P&L line items beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 29.4%, a decrease of about 100 basis points from last year. The benefit from last year's menu price increases and lower avocado prices were partially offset by elevated costs across the board, most notably in beef, tortillas, dairy, salsa beans, and rice. For Q3, we expect our cost of sales to be around 30% due to higher beef and avocado prices. Our supply chain team has done a fantastic job at diversifying our avocado exposure, and in the third quarter, the majority of our avocados will come from Peru. While prices are higher than the very favorable levels in the second quarter, we are less impacted from the volatility in the Mexican avocado market. Labor costs for the quarter were 24.3%, a decrease of about 50 basis points from last year. The benefit from sales leveraged is partially offset by wage inflation, and for Q3, we expect our labor costs to be around 25% reflecting continued labor inflation and seasonally lower sales. Other operating costs for the quarter were 13.9%, a decrease of about 40 basis points from last year. This decrease was driven by sales leverage. Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 2.4%, and in Q3, we expect marketing costs to step down to the low 2% range before stepping up in Q4 with a full year to come in right around 3%. In Q3, other operating costs are expected to be in the mid 14% range. G&A for the quarter was $157 million on a gap basis, or $153 million on a non-gap basis, excluding $3.5 million related to corporate restructuring expenses. As Brian mentioned, we recently went through a review of our organization needs to assure we're well positioned to meet our long-term growth goals. G&A also includes $119 million in underlying G&A, $29 million related to non-cash stock compensation, and $5 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes on equity, investing, and exercises. For Q3, we expect our underlying G&A to be around $125 million, and to grow slightly their efforts would make investments in technology and people to support ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will be around $31 million in Q3, although this amount could move up or down based on our performance. We also expect to recognize about $4 million related to performance-based bonus accruals and payroll taxes on equity, investing, and exercises, bringing our anticipated total G&A and Q3 to around $160 million. Appreciation for the quarter was $79 million at 3.1% of sales, and we expect depreciation to increase slightly each quarter as we continue to open more restaurants. Asset retirement stepped up to $16.2 million, which includes $8.5 million related to corporate and restaurant asset impairments, including the closure of Pizzeria Locale. In the near term, we expect asset retirement to be around $8 million per quarter as we continue to prioritize the guest experience and focus on great ops. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 23.8% due to an increase in tax benefits related to option exercises and equity investing. We continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in a 25% to 27% range, though it may vary each quarter based on discrete items. Our balance sheet remains strong as we enter the quarter with over $1.8 billion in cash, restricted cash, and investments with no debt. During the second quarter, we repurchased $88 million of our stock at an average price of $1,937. At the end of the quarter, we had $295 million remaining under our share authorization program. We opened 47 new restaurants in the second quarter of which 40 had a chipotle and we remain on track to open between 255 and 285 new restaurants this year with at least 80% including Chipotle. Our development timeline remains extended, but our pipeline remains strong, and we expect to move toward the high end of the 8% to 10% openings range once these timeline challenges subside. In closing, when I joined Chipotle, we were approaching our 10th anniversary with just over 200 restaurants. We were determined to change the way people think about and eat fast food by preparing delicious, fresh food using classic cooking techniques, sustainably raised, wholesome ingredients, and serving it quickly. Brian mentioned Chipotle celebrated its 30th anniversary earlier this month, and those fundamental values that made Chipotle successful are still deeply ingrained in our brand. Along the way, we've invested in food with integrity, expanded access and convenience through our digital channel, Chipotle's an international expansion, and continue to innovate within our restaurants to improve the overall experience. We still have a long growth runway ahead, and a talented team excited to continue to build, expand, and evolve our brand and our purpose of cultivating a better world over the next 30 years. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Charles from TD Cowan. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles : Great, thanks. I wanted to talk about pricing plans in the second half, just given inflation of the beef and avocado categories. What I'm looking to better understand is that is a price increase on the table for December when you historically took price in 2018 through \u201821, or does the resumption of student payments on September 1 that could weigh on restaurant industry spending, leads you to want to bear potentially weight on that and see how that plays out? Brian Niccol : Yes Andrew, this is Brian. Our approach on pricing has been obviously, it's a lever that we will pull as kind of the last thing we like to pull, but I think we've proven time and time again that the brand is very strong, the value proposition is very strong, and we have that pricing power to use. Obviously, I think you heard Jack's comments. We're seeing some inflationary pressure both on the labor line and in some of the food areas when you pull on avocados. It's something that we're looking hard at, and as we get closer to that fourth quarter, we'll make a decision on exactly what we want to do on the pricing front. I don't know if you want to add anything there, Jack. Jack Hartung : No, I think Brian summarized it well, but we've had underlying inflation in the last two quarters, but we've had benefits from lower cost avocados, that's offset that, and then also we've got a benefit because Chicken al Pastor has really shifted some of our customers from the more expensive beef into the less expensive chicken, that's been a benefit as well. As those benefits subside, that's when the inflation will flow through, and that's where we'll have a clear view of the inflation impact. We will, as you suggested, look at our customer demand transaction patterns as well before we make any final decisions on price. Andrew Charles : Okay, that's helpful. Then just on the 3Q guidance, I know that you guys call it out that you're seeing about five-year base points of price that rolls off in August. Can you just comment as well about the lower income consumer? I know last quarter you guys were talking about sequentially. They were seeing some strength in that consumer. I just wanted to know what you guys have seen in recent months to relate to that consumer. Brian Niccol : Yes, I mean, this is one of the elements of, I guess, the consumer demonstrating how resilient they are. Both the lower income consumer and kind of our higher income consumer are showing really good strength. I think that's why we had such a strong traffic performance in the quarter, and we continue to exit that quarter with really healthy traffic or transaction trends. So we're not seeing any weakness in the lower income consumer. If anything, they've continued to improve, and we're feeling really good about the value proposition. We're providing all income levels. Andrew Charles : Very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question comes from David Tarantino from Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi. Good afternoon. First question, I just want to clarify how you're thinking about the third quarter from a comps\u2019 perspective. And maybe, Jack, if you can just talk about the underlying traffic trend you're assuming in the third quarter relative to what you saw in the second quarter and whether that would imply any slowdown versus what you've been running? Jack Hartung : Yes, David, the components of our guidance just give kind of general ranges, and the menu price increase remaining after the August from last year rolls off will be called in that 2.5%, 2.6% range. We're still expecting positive transactions throughout the quarter. In fact, we expect the transactions will probably be in the plus 3% to plus 3.5% range, somewhere in that range. We're still seeing a little bit of a mixed impact. Our group size continues to normalize as people are returning to work, and so there's less of a channel shift between digital and in restaurant ordering, but we are seeing that the group size is lowering. So this is the hardest part to predict, but we're assuming that somewhere in that two-ish range, we'll see a negative mix because the group size, somewhere in that 2% range. So those are the general components we're thinking about. David Tarantino : And Jack, when you seasonally adjust the trends, would it imply a slowdown or is this more of the same of what you delivered in the second quarter? I just want to make sure I understand whether you're seeing a slowdown in traffic. Jack Hartung : Yes, so there is a subtle seasonality shift that we're seeing, David. We saw in early June as schools were letting out and as people started traveling more, we saw a little bit of an inflection point in transactions. We also, when we stratified our restaurants, we did see that restaurants in more touristy areas were benefiting, restaurants in non-touristy areas were a little bit softer. And just recently, within the last week, week and a half or so, we're starting to see some normalization of that. So we're still reading through that. We assume there's not going to be a full bounce back in the fourth quarter, but we did assume the normalization, or the rest of the third quarter, but we did assume that the normalization that we're seeing last week or so, that some of that will continue. So we're still trying to do a read-through, but it looks like there was maybe a little early vacation taking this year that didn't necessarily happen last year. David Tarantino : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Sara Senatore from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Sara Senatore : Great. Thank you. I just wanted to talk about throughput in the context of that sounds like the traffic's fairly stable. You talked about new equipment. I understand that cooktimes are down pretty dramatically. Could you translate that into, some sort of throughput measure and kind of what you're seeing both presently and then what the opportunity is, I guess, as we think about throughput, the capacity is one side, but then making sure that, you have enough demand there to move the customers through and I'm trying to sort of understand the dynamics there. So anything you can tell us about throughput now and what you're seeing with the new equipment? And then I'll just have a quick follow-up. Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So we've made some really good progress on the throughput side, but we're not all the way to where we want to be. I think I mentioned this earlier, where the good news is we now consistently probably have three people on the front line, but really what that needs to be is four people in order for us to achieve kind of our pillars of great throughput. And that's probably why we're retrenching again on throughput, kind of going forward here. But as I mentioned in my comments earlier, in the places where we've seen restaurants or patches adopts I'll call great throughput execution and you're definitely seeing a move on to the two three to five transactions in their best 15 minutes. So, we know it's out there, we just seem to do it as an entire enterprise and we're focused on that piece going forward. As it relates to equipment and other tools to help us become even I say more efficient and faster, the double-sided grills are now in 10 restaurants and so not obviously across the system by any means but rather just move into our stage gate process that just enabled cooking times to dramatically decrease. So, checking goes from 12 minutes to three to four minutes, stage goes from three or four minutes to a minute. It makes the position a lot easier, it makes the culinary much more consistent and then obviously it gives us much more capacity on the plancha. So, that's where we are with that. And then things like avocado and raisin very much still into pilot phase meaning like prototype phase but we're pretty optimistic about what both of those can do for us but we're not in any restaurants yet with either one of those items. Sara Senatore : And then just to sort of clarify as to follow-up is even through or again throughput and we've seen some really nice improvement in the last couple of quarters and transaction and traffic growth here it sounds like that anticipation as that'll be fairly stable. I understand the comparisons I entered that like would you expect a kind of another step change in traffic as some of what you're talking about best practices sort of disseminate across the system again just to understand how to translate throughput. Brian Niccol : Yes. No, absolutely. I mean I think there is a real opportunity for and not only the continued strength in traffic but a step up in traffic. As we get better at executing the tortilla is a throughput in, now that's why I wanted to get that example of the one restaurant in New York. That restaurant's outperforming a region, that's doing a really nice job. And the reason is because they are executing every element of our throughput tilla's with excellence. And so, as that happens more consistently across more patches or more restaurants. We anticipate we're going to see increases both in traffic and total comp. So, obviously that comes with time, we're dealing with a 110,000 employees that need to learn what great throughput is and what it looks like. But the teams making great progress, we're focused on it and I'm confident we're going to need a culture of throughput building this organization. Sara Senatore : Great. Thank you, very much. Operator : The next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Danilo Gargiulo : Thank you. So, with the low-to-mid single-digit expected comp since 3Q, what is giving you the confidence to meaningfully accelerate a trajectory in 4Q to meet the full-year guidance, especially as we think about the 4Q compatible sales potentially becoming more from traffic versus from versus from pricing action. What actions are you contemplating to sustain the momentum? Brian Niccol : Yes. I mean, obviously we're going to stay first and foremost on enhancing our operational performance as it relates to throughput. So, that will be a piece of the puzzle. We've got a new menu item that we'll be bringing out after we finish the run on Chicken Al Pastor and then obviously role will evaluate what component and pricing it has in the fourth quarter as well given some of the inflationary pressures we're seeing. So, you line those things up plus the strength of the trend that we already have and we feel really good about our full-year guidance. Danilo Gargiulo : Thank you. And maybe beyond this year or thinking a bit more multi-year on a multi-year basis, historically you have it secured it a more constant international roll out across Canada and Europe. So, what drove you to on the statement sizing and specifically why are you starting with the Middle East. So, can we expect a combination of co-op and concise mixing international market or is this more in a monetary step to fine tune your international expansion plans going forward? Jack Hartung : Yes. So, you can probably anticipate more of a mix. We still believe company ownership in Western Europe makes a lot of sense. We just had the opportunity to visit with the team there and in the last week or so, and we're making great progress in London, Frankfurt, and obviously Paris. I mean, as we mentioned in the call too, Canada continues to really perform. So, we're going to fill 10 new restaurants on a base of 34. So, you can see how we're stepping up the development there and the team they face to a great job. As it relates to the Middle East and the partnership with Alshaya. As we looked around the world, we see there are certain regions where it's like hey this makes a lot of sense for us to partner as opposed to try and go at it on our own. The Middle East is that region, Chipotle as a concept based on the work we've done, we believe it will resonate and perform really well. And then, when we have the opportunity to partner with Alshaya which we believe is one of the best operators in the region, we thought this is a great opportunity for us to experience what it's like to work with a great operator in more of a franchise environment. So, we're optimistic, we're excited about getting those restaurants opened in Dubai, and Kuwait, and we look forward to a really successful partnership with them. But we're really excited about where international can go both from a standpoint of partnerships and then company ownership. Operator : The next question comes from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. First I wanted to follow-up on the double sided growth question and then touch on the personalized marketing. On the double sided growth, you mentioned you're in 10 stores now and that it's maybe a third of the cook times. What is the pace that you anticipate on rolling that out and in as far as the metrics that we would focus on, what do you think ultimately would be the benefit to sales and profit from those growth? Brian Niccol : So, look we're obviously really excited about what we're already seeing just in the 10 restaurants both from a standpoint of yield, quality of culinary and then the team's ability to execute over and over again. So, the excitement around the new cooking equipment is terrific you see because that means we're going to get the execution that we want. To rule this out this product a year plus project, and the good news is the manufacturers have the capability to scale to what we need once we give them the green line. So, we're pretty excited about this because obviously the bigger the volumes get with the amount of transactions that we're doing, the fact that we now have even more capacity on the plancha, is a terrific outcome. And then it turns one of the harder jobs to train into one of the easiest jobs to train. And when the culinary is consistent, people get great chicken or steak, we know they love to pull in they come back. So, and we're still dialing through all the components of the puts and calls on this but it looks very promising based on where we are in the first 10 stores. David Palmer : Thanks for that. And my first one is marketing. I think you recently launched that this seems to be something that would have a long runway to it where you could have different iteration and ultimately having AI be a component to it. Are we already seeing anything different from personalized marketing, where do you see this going and maybe give us a sense of how this could be impacting your business going forward? Thanks. Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. I mean, look, probably the most visible spot is just in the app with the suggestive sale. You'll see already some personalization on what we're offering and as far as recommendations go to add the order based on your history with the brand, and then obviously this goes all the way into the cohorts and the journeys that then we create. And we believe you do this across our 35 million rewards customers and now has meaningful scale where the customization results in loyalty that results in obviously additional sale. So, the most visible space, probably you'll see it in the app at the web, and then it's probably more new launched in how we communicate awesomely communicate with you and what exactly we say to you. But all the experiments we're running, we're continuing to see nice positive outcomes with every iteration that we do. The next big step for us is to roll this out in a way where it covers a lot more people at much more meaningful scale so that you feel it on the entire enterprise. David Palmer : All right. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you. I actually want to meet with a comment about excess capacity on the planche. It's actually an interesting point. Do you think that it significantly broadens additional product opportunities that you totally can do? I mean that, double-sided grill takes care that, the chicken and the steak and presumably, maybe the planche can be used for something different than what you're already selling. How big of an opportunity is that in your mind? Brian Niccol : I mean, look, we always want to make sure we execute the menu with excellence. And we like the cadence that we're doing as far as new menu items go right now. But yes, it definitely frees up the capacity, which then allows us to evaluate how we do new menu items and maybe how long we want to keep certain menu items on. And so that is a big unlock for us. I'd say the biggest benefit, though is and when the restaurant opens at 10.30, you don't have to start cooking chicken at eight in the morning. Because now we can be ready for that lunch business closer to the timing of lunch because it just takes a lot less time to cook all the chicken to be prepared. It also allows us to recover a lot faster. So in the event, you have a really big, lunch push at 11, you have the ability to recover for that lunch push that might be coming at 12. And so these are the things that I think are going to be really powerful for us going forward. And then also the simplicity at which the cooking creates for the team members is a big unlock too because then the culinary is just that much better every single time. John Ivankoe : Yes, I got it. And I agree in experience. Let me turn it to another question. You've been alluding to, including on this call, upward bias to the 7000 North American store target. I guess, are you prepared to start thinking about numbers and there's a thousands at thousands. And I want to ask it in a question some years ago. I remember, I don't remember exactly when it was, it used to be discussed that Chipotle would be a $10 billion brand. Well, here we are in '23 and all likelihood it will be a $10 billion brand. Sorry for that. If you were to just look at the overall North American opportunity today, and I guess to some extent free the economy, how big of a brand do you think Chipotle could be just based on what you know about, the North American consumer market today in terms of how big we could expand from here? Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. I mean, look, we're not ready to change the number yet, but the good news is the economics of every new restaurant that we open continue to be just terrific economics, where hopefully we'll get closer to the higher end of that age to 10% once kind of we work through a little bit of the bottleneck that we have on development. But I believe we're going to continue to grow the four wall revenue and then obviously the economics that come with it. So without even moving the $7,000 store count, if you all of a sudden find yourself at $3 million, $4 million average unit volumes, you're in that $20 to $28 billion range. So lots of growth in front of us. And that's without having to be really all that aggressive. That is just executing the plan we've been talking about. And I think as long as Chipotle stays focused on great culinary, great throughput, developing team members so that we're ready to go when we open new restaurants, the number will grow. I think Jack told me when the company first went public, what was the number Jack? Jack Hartung : 3000. Brian Niccol : We said we were going to maybe do 3000 restaurants. So here we are. We're at 3000 restaurants. I'm sure as we continue to grow both the AUVs will go up and the store council will go up. But yes, it's pretty fun to think about we're closing it on $10 billion and then I'm sure we'll be talking about $20 billion and then probably from there we'll be talking about $30 billion. So I don't see a cap on this business anytime soon. John Ivankoe : Excellent. Thank you so much. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Mullan from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Brian Mullan : Hey, thank you. Just a question on automation, robotics in general. Hypothetically, if all your combined efforts were to yield a couple hundred base points of margin over, the next many number of years, are you inclined to want to let that all fall to the bottom line? Or perhaps would you want to let some of it fall to the bottom line and then spun the consumer value proposition with the rest? Maybe it's too early to say just wondering if you're already having those questions internally, even if it's just philosophical right now. Brian Niccol : Yes, look, I mean, obviously the good news for us is. We aren't capital constrained to invest in continuing to drive the Chipotle business, both in growth and in value as it relates to giving a great experience for a customer and a great experience for a team member. So obviously as we get closer, we'll have a better idea of how much of it falls to the bottom line. But, right now I'm hoping a lot of it falls to the bottom line. But we'll know a lot more as we get closer to when we roll it out. Brian Mullan : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Chris O'Cull from Stifel. Please go ahead. Chris O'Cull: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Brian, it sounds like the hyphen make line is close to that testing stage. So, can you help us understand how long you expect it to be in that phase and maybe walk through what the validation stage could look like? I'm also curious if you could describe what KPI is the team's monitoring to determine the success of that make line? Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So we have an inter-cultivate center right now. It's fun to see it actually producing bulls and the team has done a phenomenal job of taking this from, a concept to a prototype to now a working prototype. We've learned a lot. We're getting ready to figure out what the next gen version on this is, but it looks really promising. Obviously, key components of this are how fast can it do bulls, per 10 minutes, how accurate can it do the bulls, and then obviously our ability to expedite those bulls, meaning getting it to the customer in the correct order. So we think assuming the prototype continues to evolve and grow the way it has demonstrated its growth over time, we'll have something to be putting into restaurants here in the next 12 to 18 months. So optimistic about where this gets to, but it's one thing to run it in our cultivate center. It's another thing to run it in a restaurant. And until we run it in a restaurant, it's hard to really talk about the benefits or what the timing is of it. But conceptually, and what it looks like right now, still very promising a top priority to figure out how we get this thing into a restaurant sooner rather than later. Chris O'Cull: Great. And then I just had a follow-up. Jack, the step up in the underlying G&A run rate was pretty considerable. Can you break down maybe what's driving that in a little more detail, and then how we should be thinking about the core run rate in the fourth quarter, and then maybe even just underlying growth for the out year? Jack Hartung : Yes. I mean, any increase in our underlying G&A is around some of the things that Brian mentioned, and it was part of our review where we're investing in resources for Europe. We're adding resources, frankly, for some of the innovation that we're talking about in terms of probiotics and things like that. There's some items in there where our equity, we're expecting our equity based on our projections. We'll step up. These are three-year calculations that you're making. So, but in terms of underlying G&A, it's going to be either people to support our growth or tech to support our growth. We haven't given fourth quarter guidance, but I would expect there'd be another slight, a step up from Q3. Not a huge step up, but a modest step up. As we make sure we've got our teams all stepped up for the growth that we want to support, not just for this year but for the next several years going forward. Chris O'Cull: Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question comes from Jon Tower from Citi. Please go ahead. Jon Tower : Great. Thanks. I just wanted to dig into development a little bit. And, Jack, I know you and your prepared remarks talked about some delays in the system, and I was hoping maybe you could drill into it a little bit, especially as you're thinking about, getting to that 8%-10% range in terms of unit growth over time. Can you really get into what's driving some of the delays in the market today? Is it, say, local market permitting, builder or developer issues, or are there problems with accessing equipment? I was hoping you could flesh that out for us. Jack Hartung : Yes, it's not really equipment anymore. That was a challenge through the pandemic, and as we got out of the pandemic, but our teams have done a good job to pre-order, so we had bulk ordering. We've had good relations with our suppliers, so we get priority. So it's really down to things that are city, under the city control, like getting utilities to the site. Sometimes it takes us weeks to just get somebody, to come out and make sure that we have utilities in, that are coming to the site. It does involve things like permitting, and then you talk about inspections as well. So it's really a lot of these cities, what we're hearing from our teams is that a lot of them are still working remote. And so to get somebody to show up when they need to show up and do the work has been a real challenge. Now, what we're doing, Chris is here and Chris has been sending this message to the team is, we really got to rise to the city, okay? We have to make sure we're calling, calling, calling because they're doing some work and whether they're working at home or whether they're working in the office, they're doing some work. Let's make sure that we're at the top of the list, that they're hearing those often. And if they hear us more often, it's likely they're going to move it. So that's the strategy to try to hopefully remove that bottleneck. Jon Tower : Got it. And just pivoting to the throughput initiatives, I appreciate all the training you guys have been doing. I'm just curious, I know Brian, you mentioned that, like, even on the make lines, making sure people, four people are on the front line at peak. Do you think you need to add labor hours to stores? Is it purely just getting people back to the aces and their places kind of belief? Brian Niccol : Yes, no, it's more to do with getting the trust in the team to have the confidence to stay aces and places. Just yesterday I was in a restaurant and staffed, the deployment was right, the culinary was right, the restaurant looked great. Unfortunately, we didn't have aces and places. You had too many people leaving the line to do other tasks that they shouldn't have been doing when they got a line to the door. And I think once they understand that they stay in those places, they'll power through that line to then go take care of the tasks accordingly. So I think it's an element of they got to see it for themselves, they got to experience it, they got to trust it, because sometimes it's hard. I mean, it's hard to just stay in position when you, think you might need some more napkins out by the drink station. It's like, well, hang in there, get through the line, and then you can go put additional napkins in the drink station. So I think it's a component of they need experiences with it so that they can trust it. And I know Scott and the team are laser focused on getting the pillars of great throughput back into our culture, not just as an initiative. And the good news is, we're staffed, turnover is looking really good at the general manager level. And we're now in the low 20s. So their leader is staying much more consistent. I think you have consistency in leadership, consistency in message, we'll get consistency in execution. So I'm very optimistic about where Scott and the operators are going to get us to when it comes to throughput. Jon Tower : Got it. Thanks. And then just lastly, I know your, your lines are somewhat capacity constrained. So in terms of adding additional items to the menu, not always easy, often times at the rotate, but with,-- I think chicken al Pastor, I believe you said about 20% of your mix, transaction mix came from that during the period. So how, how, when do we think about that potentially becoming a permanent menu item? Brian Niccol : Well, look, it's something we definitely will go back and evaluate. Obviously this was one that struck a chord with a lot of people and I can understand why it tastes great and it is great. So we'll reevaluate if and when it makes sense to bring it back, how long we bring it back for, and if it should be a permanent item. The challenge for us is I think if you, we wanted to add something permanent, we got to remove something. So, that'd be something that we have to work through to just make sure we understand the trade off. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thanks for taking the questions. Brian Niccol : Yes. Operator : The next question comes from Dennis Geiger from UBS. Please go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thank you. Just wondering if you could provide a breakdown of the, the traffic price and mix for the, for the two queue. I think you gave the, the traffic component, but if you could kind of loosely break out those, those others, that'd be helpful. Jack Hartung : Yes. The traffic, I mentioned traffic in my comments, better than 4%, you know, on a positive side on traffic, the menu price increase was in the mid five, I call it 5.5, 5.6, something like that. And then we had this, this mix item that I've mentioned, we're talking about the third quarter that actually reduced the comp by about 2.5%. And that, that mix is entirely due to group size. The group sizes continue to normalize as we continue, you're watching people going back to the office. You're seeing our, our urban locations, our outcomping or suburban location. So there's still been a normalization since the pandemic and our group sizes are still continuing to normalize. They're still group size. They're still ahead of where we were in 2019 before the pandemic, but they, they continue to normalize pretty much each quarter. Dennis Geiger : Very helpful Jack. Just one or just, I know mix is probably a tough one group size in particular to, to predict. You give us the, the three queue as we look to the end of the year. Can that still be, I think closer to flat by the end of the year, or is that a little bit of a moving target given, given group size behaviors? And maybe that's tough to predict. Thank you. Jack Hartung : Yes, I don't think it'll be totally flat, but it should narrow. In this current quarter, we're about 1% group size over where we were in 2019. If you look at Q3 and Q4, they were about 3% to 4% it was, it was, 4% and Q3, 3% and Q4. So we've still got a gap there. That's still to close, but it should diminish the two and a half that we saw on Q2 should diminish each quarter. I don't think it'll be totally flat by the end of the year though. Dennis Geiger : Thanks, Jack. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Harbour from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Brian Harbour : Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Jack, could you just elaborate on some of the food cost drivers? I mean, you mentioned kind of what's, what's really driven a year-over-year, but maybe just versus last quarter versus some of your expectations. I'm sure avocado is part of it, but anything else. And also just as we, think about the rest of the year, will this new item, affect food costs in any way that we should think about? Jack Hartung : Yes. I mean, during, during the quarter, we had just a number of things that just had a slight increase. We had, some of our salsas or tortillas, our rice, our spices and all those, if you look at just the quarter, and if you look at the quarter consecutively, so Q2 versus Q1 that added like 40 or 50 basis points, but those were offset by a combination of favorable avocados compared to last year, as well as chicken al Pastor, as I mentioned before, it actually did ship people from steak and barbacoa, which is more, more expensive, higher food costs to our chicken, which is a lower food cost. So we've had this, just call it low grade inflation. That's been hitting the P&L the last couple of quarters, but it's been offset by favorable avocados and then favorable mix. One reason why, as we look forward into the, into the third quarter we do think there's going to be a bump up in food costs. And that's really attributable to this same kind of low grade inflation that we expect will continue into Q3 but we're not going to have as avocado prices normalize. And as we shipped away from chicken al pastor, we won't have that kind of offset to offset some of the inflation that we're seeing. Brian Harbour : Okay. Thanks. Could you also just elaborate on what you said about Europe? And I guess the, the broader question is just how fast might we see that grow as we start to think about the next few years? Brian Niccol : Yes, look, I think very similar to what we did with Canada is the way to think about Europe, once we get performance consistent in Europe, like we did in Canada, we'll start building much more aggressively. The team is very much focused on ensuring that we're building a brand. And as we build the brand, we have the economics that support building a lot of restaurants and like I mentioned Jack, myself and Scott, we were just over there and the team has a terrific plan. The thing I love to see is when I was in, Frankfurt, Germany, there were a lot of Germans in a Chipotle enjoying Chipotle. When we were in London, there were a lot of Brits enjoying Chipotle. The thing that I also saw was a lot of people walked up at the restaurant and had no idea of what Chipotle is. So we still have a real opportunity to build a brand. And while we build that brand, ensure that we've got great economics that justify, building a lot more restaurants. Canada is a perfect example. We put a great leader in place there and not she's headed out of the park, the economics perform. She's doing a nice job of growing the brand, not surprising. We're building a lot of restaurants. So, most recently, we just sent one of our top operators over to London to be a part of that team, lead the team with that work that he's putting in place. I'm already seeing, big, big improvements in operational execution and I'm confident the economics will follow and I'm confident we'll build a terrific brand. So assuming that all happens, you can see us then quickly being able to invest into building a lot more restaurants in those countries. So I think we've been pretty consistent on this. It's like we're in no rush to just start building restaurants for the sake of building restaurants. We want to have people that are ready to go. We want to have economics that makes sense and then we want to have a great brand that we can execute against time and time again. So that's served us well in the United States. It's serving us well in Canada. I believe it'll serve us well in Europe. Brian Harbour : Thank you. Operator : And the last question comes from Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, good afternoon. This is John Park on for Zach. I guess on the franchising side, are there any more details you guys can provide on your new agreement with Alshaya? I guess around like the number of units in the initial development agreement, anything on the royalty rates, things like that. Brian Niccol : Not really. We're just getting started with Alshaya. We're excited to get the first couple of restaurants open. Obviously, both of us have expectations of a lot more restaurants than just a handful. And I'm confident we're going to have great openings and this is going to turn into something that hopefully Alshaya considers a huge success and we consider a huge success. So more details to come, but we probably need to open the first one. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And then just kind of switching gears a little bit. On the labor side, have you guys kind of started to see any leveling out of wage inflation for new hires as you kind of move through Q2 and into Q3? Brian Niccol : I would say it's more normal. It's in the 4%, 3% in that range. So there's still inflation. It's another consideration as we look at our model, look at our margins when we take pricing action. So it's not anything we can't handle. The great news is the applications are coming in. Our restaurants are doing a great job of staffing the restaurants. They're doing a great job of getting our restaurants to model. So this is, I would call it again, kind of a low grade normal inflation going forward. Nothing that our model can't absorb. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks a lot. Operator : This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Brian Niccol : All right, thank you. And thanks everybody for all the questions. I'll just wrap up with, again, I think Chipotle's demonstrated an excellent quarter. And I think it demonstrates the strength of our business. Very proud of what our teams have accomplished in the field. If I think about where we are today versus where we were a year ago, we are operating these restaurants significantly better. I believe there's still a lot of upside in our ability to drive throughput going forward. I'm confident the teams are focused on it and we're going to, see that happen. The other thing that I'm really excited about in our business is that we're growing our business through traffic growth, and we're doing it, in my opinion, the right way, where we're continuing to drive our value proposition forward with great culinary, great people, and obviously great new restaurant opening. So very proud of our results, very optimistic about the future, and look forward to sharing our results next quarter with you all. Take care. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Olsen, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead. Cindy Olsen : Hello, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations Web site at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our actual results could differ materially from those projections in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our Web site. We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire Executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Niccol : Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. Our focus on exceptional food and exceptional people continues to drive strong results, including positive transaction trends that accelerated throughout the quarter. For the quarter, sales grew over 11% to reach $2.5 billion driven by a 5% comp. Digital sales represented 37% of sales.  Restaurant level margin was 26.3%, an increase of 100 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $11.36, representing 19% growth over last year and we opened 62 new restaurants, including 54 Chipotlanes. Trends remain strong in October and we anticipate comps in the mid to high single digit range for the fourth quarter, which includes our recent pricing action.  Before updating on our strategic priorities, I'm thrilled to share that Laura Fuentes has joined our Board of Directors. Laura is the Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer of Hilton Worldwide with extensive experience in global hospitality and people leadership, and will be pivotal in helping Chipotle deliver against our five key strategies that position us to win today while we grow our future.  These include running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; sustaining world class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level; making the brand visible, relevant and loved to improve overall guests engagement; amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants and support centers; and expanding access convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings and laying the foundation for international expansion.  Beginning with running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture. It was exactly a year ago that we made a big effort internally to get back to Chipotle standard of excellence and I'm proud of the progress our restaurant teams have made over the course of the year. This includes staffing and turnover that are back to or better than pre-pandemic levels. Restaurants that are prepped and ready resulting in fewer outages, improvements in on-time and accuracy on the digital make line and continued progress on throughput.  Our focus on ops is strengthening a core piece of our value proposition which is customized, delicious culinary served quickly with great hospitality. As a result of improvements in operational execution, along with keeping our menu pricing accessible, our value proposition has never been stronger. This is certainly translating to great results with transaction comps positive all year and up over 4% in the third quarter.  While we are sitting on a strong foundation, we see an opportunity to be even better, particularly when it comes to throughput. We have two key initiatives that we recently rolled out that we believe will drive further improvement. The first is adjusting the cadence of digital orders to better balance the deployment of labor, eliminating the need to pull a crew member from the front make line to help the digital make line during peak periods.  And the second is a renewed focus on throughput training in our restaurants by bringing back a coaching tool that we had in place prior to the pandemic. Feedback from our restaurant teams on these two initiatives has been very positive, and we're seeing that restaurants that have the right cadence of orders on the digital make line and that are executing the four pillars of throughput are seeing an improvement of four to five entrees in their peak 15-minute period.  As I mentioned in the past, we hold our teams to a high standard because when they achieve it, they feel like they are part of a winning team with the ability to be rewarded through bonuses and growth within the organization. For our crew members, throughput is a key performance factor in the crew member bonus plan. It is also a component of the bonus measure for general managers, field leaders, team directors and regional vice presidents. As we coach and make progress on throughput, they will enable more restaurants to achieve their quarterly bonus and importantly will drive a better overall experience for our guests and our teams. Speaking of our teams, we recently brought back our Behind the Foil campaign which features our crew members giving a glimpse into daily preparation using real ingredients in classic culinary techniques, a key differentiator for Chipotle. The fact is we don't have freezers in our restaurants and our teams begin preparing at 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock in the morning to be able to serve our delicious food by the time we open at 10.30.  This includes grilling Fajita Veggies and Adobo Chicken on the Plancha, slicing and dicing onions, jalapenos, and cilantro by hand. Also hand mashing avocados to make our signature guacamole and making our chips fresh every day. This campaign is a great way to put a spotlight on our talented teams and their hard work to prepare our exceptional food. One of our team directors that was featured in Behind the Foil started as a crew member and within seven years moved his way up to team director managing a sub region of 49 restaurants at just 29 years old. His passion for the brand and helping to deliver an excellent customer experience has driven his success. In fact, he is one of the best performing sub regions across the company. He truly believes in Chipotle's purpose and wants the position [ph] to be able to replicate the same opportunities that have been given to him.  Our people are our greatest asset and developing future leaders is critical delivering on our growth goals of reaching 7,000 restaurants longer term and surpassing 90% internal promotions. We will continue to find ways like our Behind the Foil campaign to celebrate our team's growth, hard work, success and passion for Chipotle. In addition to this campaign, our marketing team has done an outstanding job in finding authentic ways to make the brand more visible, more relevant and more loved.  Last month, we brought back our fan favorite and highly requested Carne Asada as a limited time offer and the reception has surpassed our expectations. Carne Asada is a delicious combination of responsibly raised premium cuts of steak seasoned on the grill with a blend of signature spices that's finished with freshly squeezed lime and hand chopped cilantro.  We also introduced an entirely new way to try Carne Asada with the Carne Asada Quesadilla, and it's just truly delicious. I'm really proud of the cross functional effort it took to make sure we could bring back this popular LTO which is especially impressive given that we estimate only about 5% of U.S. beef meets our food with integrity standards.  In sports, as college football season kicked off, we leveraged our Real Food for Real Athletes platform to partner with players and teams to showcase their inspiring journeys, their love for Chipotle and how our food can help them perform their best by providing proper nutrition. We also leveraged creative gaming integrations as a fun way to connect with some of our biggest fans.  We brought back Chipotle IQ in August as a one-of-a-kind digital trivia game testing the knowledge of Chipotle's real ingredients, leading food standards, culinary techniques, sustainability efforts, brand history and community engagement. Shifting to an amplifying technology, we're making progress on a couple of innovations that ultimately could help to improve the overall experience for our restaurant teams and our guests. The first is our automated digital make line, which we recently installed at our Cultivate Center to test and learn on.  Through our partnership with Hyphen, we've been testing the Hyphen make line which fits into our existing digital make line footprint and automatically makes bowls down below with the ability for our team to build tacos, burritos, kids meals and quesadillas on top. There are many reasons why we are excited about automating the digital make line, such as increased capacity and improved speed and accuracy, which can further help with the balance of labor between the front make line and the digital make line.  Additionally, Autocado which cuts, cores and scoops avocados is also at our Cultivate Center, and our restaurant teams are providing feedback to be included in the next phase of the prototype. As we mentioned last quarter, Autocado could save time and eliminate a less favorable task but still allow for one of their favorite parts of the job, which is that in freshly chopped onions, jalapenos and cilantro, seasoned with some citrus and salt and hand mash or signature guac.  While we still have some iterations to make the Hyphen and Autocado before they are ready to be tested in a restaurant, I am excited about the progress the team is making and we will continue to provide updates on the path through the stage gate process.  Finally, moving to expanding access and convenience. We are on track to reach our guidance range of opening between 255 to 285 new restaurants this year, which will mark a record for the company and we surpassed 700 Chipotlanes this quarter. As we look out to 2024, we anticipate opening between 285 to 315 new restaurants with at least 80% having a Chipotlane. This month, we opened our first location in Calgary. This was the first entrance into a new market in Canada since we entered Vancouver in 2012, and it's clear there's strong demand for Chipotle with opening day sales hitting a new company record. The team in Canada has done an outstanding job with company leading throughput on the front line and on time and accuracy on the digital make line. AUVs margins and returns are on par with the U.S., and I remain very confident in Canada's long-term growth potential.  Outside of North America, we have outlined a plan for Europe to deliver economics that would support accelerated growth. This includes improving our operations by aligning our training tools, systems and culinary with our U.S. operations where it makes sense and is feasible, as well as building brand awareness.  Similar to our strategy when we first entered new markets in the U.S., we were building brand awareness in Europe to more local initiatives like partnering with local universities, local sports teams and focusing on activities which gets our food into the hands of potential guests. The good news is our restaurants are staffed, stable and the talent we have coming through is exciting. Finally, in the Middle East, we are collaborating with Alshaya Group across development, culinary, supply chain and food safety to support a successful opening of our restaurants next year in Kuwait and Dubai. In closing, I remain really excited about all the growth ahead of us both in the U.S. and internationally. I want to thank our restaurant and support center teams for all their hard work and dedication to Chipotle. Our results demonstrate that we have a winning team that sets high standards and delivers. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us and we will continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in terms of running great restaurants with exceptional people, exceptional food and fast throughput. I am more confident than ever that we have created the foundation to achieve our aggressive growth goals and further our purpose of cultivating a better world.  With that, I'll turn it over to Jack. Jack Hartung : Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the third quarter grew over 11% year-over-year to reach $2.5 billion as comp sales grew 5% with over 4% transaction growth. Restaurant level margin of 26.3% increased about 100 basis points compared to last year. And earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $11.36, representing 19% year-over-year growth. The third quarter had $1 million in unusual expenses related to corporate restructuring. Looking ahead to Q4, based on the trends we've seen so far in the quarter, including mid single digit transaction comps, we anticipate comps in the mid to high single digit range, which includes our recent price increase of about 3%. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we will reevaluate estimated loyalty breakage for points projected to expire, which may require a catch-up adjustment that could have a negative or positive impact on our comp and that's not factored into our guidance. We continue to forecast full year comps in the mid to high single digit range. I'll now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 29.7%, a decrease of about 10 basis points from last year. The benefit from last year's menu price increases was mostly offset by inflation across several food costs, most notably beef and queso. For Q4, we expect our cost of sales to be right around 30% as the benefit of the menu pricing increase we just took will be offset by the mix shift from Chicken al Pastor to Carne Asada as well as higher cheese and avocado prices.  Labor costs for the quarter were 24.9%, a decrease of about 20 basis points from last year. The benefit from sales leverage was mostly offset by wage inflation. And for Q4, we expect labor costs to be in the mid 25% range as the benefit of the menu price increase will be offset by continued labor inflation. And within our guidance, we anticipate a similar level of paid time off and other benefits that we experienced in the fourth quarter of last year.  Other operating costs for the quarter were 14%, a decrease of about 50 basis points from last year. This decrease was primarily driven by sales leverage. Marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 2%. And in Q4, we expect marketing costs to step up to the mid 3% range with a full year to come in just below 3%. In Q4, other operating costs are expected to be in the low 15% range.  G&A for the quarter was $159 million on a GAAP basis or $158 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $1 million related to corporate restructuring expenses. G&A also included $120 million in underlying G&A, $34 million related to non-cash stock compensation, $3 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes on equity vesting and exercises and $1 million related to our upcoming All Managers Conference, which is scheduled for Q1 of next year. For Q4, we expect our underlying G&A to be around $125 million and to grow slightly thereafter as we make investments in technology and people to support ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will be around $33 million in Q4, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance. We also expect to recognize about $3 million related to performance-based bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity investing, exercises and $2 million related to our All Managers Conference, bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q4 to around $163 million.  We anticipate preopening expenses to around $15 million in Q4 due to the cadence of new restaurant openings. And as a reminder, about half of preopening expense is non-cash preopening rent related to straight line accounting rules. Depreciation for the quarter was $79 million or 3.2% of sales, and for Q4 we anticipate depreciation expenses to step up by $4 million to $5 million due to a larger number of expected new restaurant openings.  Asset retirement was $7.2 million in the quarter and in Q4 we expect asset retirement to be around $8 million as we continue to focus on proactive equipment replacement as we prioritize the guest experience through great operations.  Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 24.2%, which benefited from higher than expected tax credits. We continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary each quarter based on discrete items.  Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with over $1.9 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt. During the third quarter, we repurchased $226 million of our stock at an average price of $1,914, more than 2.5x our Q2 purchases as we were optimistic as the market softened. At the end of the quarter, we had $368 million remaining under our share authorization program.  We opened 62 new restaurants in the third quarter, of which 54 had a Chipotlane, and we remain on track to open between 255 to 285 new restaurants this year. And as Brian mentioned, we plan to open between 285 and 315 new restaurants in 2024, of which at least 80% will have a Chipotlane.  We anticipate that our timeline will remain extended which is preventing us from reaching the higher end of our 8% to 10% new restaurant opening guidance range in 2024. We continue to see permitting and inspection delays, utility installation delays, along with developers delaying projects due to macro pressures and rising interest rates. Considering our current pipeline and timeline, and assuming conditions do not worsen from here, we believe we can approach 10% new restaurant openings by 2025.  To conclude, I want to once again thank our 114,000 employees for treasuring our guests and earning every single customer visit. We have exceptional people working hard every day to serve exceptional food to our guests, and that shows through these terrific results. As Brian mentioned, we have a lot of opportunity in front of us, and as we continue to make meaningful progress in improving the guest experience through faster throughput in our restaurants. This will further strengthen our brand and industry leading economic model, and continue to position us for long-term growth.  With that, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Sara Senatore : Thank you so much. I just wanted to ask about unit growth, if I may, both the U.S. and then Europe. Jack, you noted that you could get to the high end of that 8 to 10 for '25. I guess I'm curious how or what you're doing just sort of address the construction permitting delays I think should probably continue. Are you sort of widening the funnel in terms of the sites that you identify and the kind of work you do to start? I guess I'm trying to understand sort of the competence in getting back there assuming the environment doesn't change that much. And then for Europe, you talked about getting economics, you could support accelerated growth, do you need to get AUVs higher or are the sales volumes there, but it's really about kind of operational efficiency and the training that you talked about? Thanks. Jack Hartung : Yes. Sara, I'll start within the U.S. When we talk about getting to the high end of the 8% to 10% range by 2025, that actually assumes that we don't get better in terms of the timeline. It assumes that things stay as they are. What that tells you is just every year, our teams are doing a great job of building a very robust pipeline. And so that pipeline is really filling up. And as these timelines have been extending, that pipeline just keeps getting bigger. And so if you just assume we have the same timelines going forward for the next couple of years, we should get close to that 10% range. Now having said that, we've also challenged our teams. We challenge our teams to take a look at what is causing some of the delays. What can we do from a mix standpoint? Are there simpler deals that we can go after that would shorten the timeline? Can we work with developers if developers are getting way too far [ph], but there are things that we can do from an economic standpoint that might accommodate that? So we challenge our teams to shorten the timeline. But in terms of us getting to 10%, frankly, our pipeline we think can get us there even if the timeline stay the same? And then, Brian, I don't know if you want to comment on Europe? Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So on Europe, Sara, you basically -- in your question was the answer. So the top line looks really good. We're working hard on how we get that to flow to the bottom line. So some operating efficiencies and just getting better at managing the business is really what we're focused on. Sara Senatore : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi. Good afternoon. My question is about the traffic performance you\u2019re seeing. I think Brian, you mentioned that it accelerated as the quarter went on and stayed strong in October. And we've been hearing I guess more broadly that the consumer spending environment may have done the opposite. So I was wondering if you could maybe unpack the drivers that you think drove the divergence that you're seeing? And specifically, was hoping that you could talk about the comparison related to Garlic Guajillo Steak and also what you're seeing on the throughput side as a contributor to that? Thanks. Brian Niccol : So yes, David, our transactions actually throughout the quarter, every month showed improvement. And we continue to see that transaction strength where we are today. So the things that we've been focusing on is, look, get staffed, get trained, get deployed. And kind of the way we describe this is you got great people, great culinary, great throughput, and I think we're seeing that come through in our results. Combine that with the fact that we just launched Carne Asada and the foundation of operational performance I think is critical in making Carne Asada be probably a performer that will outperform what we saw with Garlic Guajillo Steak. I know that was a favorite of yours. But I'm sorry to say that Carne Asada might outperform it. But regardless, I think what's really important is our operators have done a terrific job of getting back to the basics of staffing, training, deploying, and then holding ourselves accountable to great throughput, and we're seeing every month some improvements in throughput. And that continues to be the case that we enter the fourth quarter. And I think that's why we continue to see really good traffic results. And we're going to protect the value proposition. We're going to protect the brand position that we have. And I think we'll get rewarded with hopefully more than our fair share of transactions. Jack Hartung : Yes. And the only thing I would add Brian to that is we\u2019re reading the same things David that you are and the consumer is clearly under pressure with inflation over the past year and pretty much everything with gas and groceries and really across the board higher interest rates. We continue to do well not just across our income levels, but with the lower income. They're holding up really well. They're really hanging in there at about the same level as our medium and high income levels. So I think the Chipotle value where we haven't raised prices in over a year until this latest action I think is coming through and people are choosing to dine at Chipotle because we are very affordable. Brian Niccol : And sorry, one other because this is a favorite topic of ours here is we do love the fact that our growth is being driven by transactions, which I do think is really important to ongoing health for our business and our opportunity to grow going forward. So really proud of the team and really proud of the result for this quarter. David Tarantino : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thank you. Wondering if there's anything else to highlight on the strength of the margins in the third quarter? And I guess more importantly, how that's shaping how you're thinking about next year and specifically, Jack, if 27% margin is at $1 trillion AUV, if that's kind of still the right way to think about the margin AUV dynamic? Jack Hartung : Yes. I would describe our margin right now. We're not quite at 3 million, but knock on the door, we should get there next year, and we're knocking on the door of 27%. We're not all the way there yet. We're at 26.5% year-to-date and 26.3% for the quarter. Fourth quarter typically is a lower margin quarter for us. It will be closer to 26% and 27%. But I would call that knocking on the door and just give you an idea. We're not going to do this. But if for example we chose to take an extra 1% or 1.25% in pricing, our margin would be at 27%. Now we're not going to drive our margins based on that. We're really using menu pricing just to offset inflation. But it gives you an idea with a little bit of extra pricing or with a little break in terms of some of the commodity costs, the ingredient costs next year. We've had multiple years of inflation, if those ease a little bit, if labor inflation eases a little bit as well. There's a number of ways to get there. And I would use the algorithm as more a long-term guidepost rather than something we're going to look to be right on the money every single quarter, every single year. So I feel like our economic model is really, really healthy. We're really knocking on a door of that 27%. And with a break here or there, I think we will hopefully get there next year. Dennis Geiger : That's great. Thanks for that. And then I appreciate the strong traffic number in the third quarter. Can you just provide the price and mix breakdown in the third quarter, Jack, and if you care to talk at all about how to think about those components into the fourth quarter level thinking about that mix in particular? Thank you very much. Jack Hartung : Yes, sure. The price we were running in the quarter was in the high 2s, call it right around 2.8-ish, something like that. And remember, that's all from pricing we took last year. We didn't take any additional pricing until just recently. And mix did ease a little bit. Mix was more than 2% range. So you add that on top of a better than 4% transaction comp during the quarter, and that's how you get there. Looking forward into Q4 with a 3% we just took, remember we took it in the second half of October so that will average out to about a 2.2 percentage, call it a low 2 menu price increase. We are starting or we did start to see the negative mix component ease during the quarter. And if that continues, we would expect that the mix component would be still a drag but it would be hopefully closer to a drag of 1% than the 2% that we saw in this quarter. And of course, Brian mentioned we continue to see strong mid single digit transaction comps in the fourth quarter so far. Dennis Geiger : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Charles with TD Cowan. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles : Great. Thanks. Jack, a simple clarification, do you consider the recent 3% price increase to brace yourselves for AB 1228 next year? Or are you planning a separate California targeted price increase to be utilized sometime around April to help mitigate the impact of the higher California wages? Jack Hartung : Yes. This does not consider any part of the California wages that'll happen next year. We've been studying that, Andrew, as you can imagine, already. It's going to be a pretty significant increase to our labor. Our average wages in California are right around 17%, so we get the minimum up to 20% and to make sure that we take care of compression as well. We're going to have to increase wages in call it the high teens to 20% or so. We haven't made a decision on exactly what level of pricing we're going to take. But to take care of the dollar cost of that and/or the margin, part of that we haven't decided yet where we will land with that. It's going to be a mid to high single digit price increase, but we are definitely going to pass this on. We just haven't made a final decision as to what level yet. Andrew Charles : Got you. Okay, that's helpful. And then, Brian, a question on innovation, it looks like there's no innovation in the stage gate process as obviously you're prioritizing operations and projects square one [ph]. I'm curious, what do you need to see to resume your new menu innovation, in particular, if it's reaching a number of transactions per peak 15 minute or some other measure looking at to resume new menu innovation piloting? Brian Niccol : Yes. So the teams are still working and iterating on menu innovation. One of the things that they uncovered, which I'm really excited about, is we have an opportunity to just talk about our core menu. So there's very little awareness and understanding of what [indiscernible] are. And you'll probably be seeing our team's doing some work on how do we bring to life what we currently have on our menu so that customers can understand and truly enjoy everything that we currently offer? At the same token, they're still doing some work on what are some new menu items. And we're also doing work on bringing back some menu innovation that we've done in the past that has really rung the bell. So I'm feeling really good about where our menu stands and the pipeline that we have for news over the next, call it, 18 to 24 months. Andrew Charles : Awesome. Looking forward to it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. A question on labor productivity. I'm wondering how you're thinking about the drivers on getting back to something like you've done in the past, that 23% or so labor margin, what are the key unlocks from here? You're obviously finding some traction on just paying attention to how you deploy labor and some of the things you're doing even with computer vision and whatnot. But then there's the other side, which might be the bigger leap stuff with equipment. So I'm wondering how you're thinking about the timing of these things, and how I'm really obviously thinking about 2024 and what drivers you see there? Jack Hartung : Yes. David, I don't know that we'll see 23% at least not in the near future. We've taken on some significant labor inflation over the last few years. And this California Act that we just talked about, California is only 15% of our restaurants. But that's all by itself. Next year, that's going to add 2.5% to 3% inflation to our overall company, inflation in labor. So I don't know that we'll see 23%. But the essence of your question is, what are we going to do to continue to be efficient with labor? And I think you hit on all the key pieces. For what we have in our restaurants today, we're really efficient. It doesn't mean we don't have some opportunity, but our teams are doing a great job. And for the most part, they're using the labor that they need to throughout the day. I think the unlock is that we have the labor deployed properly. Brian mentioned this during his prepared comments so that we have the right people that are staying on the frontline, so we could drive better throughput. When we drive better throughput, we know with a 40% flow through and we know with our ability to lever labor that that labor percent will go down. And then over the I'll call it the medium term and long term with things like Autocado and with Hyphen, I think there's opportunities for us to try to offset some of the labor inflation. But I just don't know that we would be able to get all the way down to 23%. That would be an 8% deflation. And that'd be I think difficult to accomplish. But rest assured that there's a lot of things that as we're working on investments that can make not just reduced hours, but also make the jobs of our crew easier, better and free them up so they can provide better customer service, we're definitely going to invest in that. David Palmer : Yes. If it makes you feel any better, I don't think anybody has 23% in their models or anything, but -- Jack Hartung : Okay. Just wanted to make sure. David Palmer : When you mentioned the four to five entrees in that peak 15 minute window improvement, what is the benefit to same-store traffic and/or just labor productivity you're getting from that? Can you put that into perspective? Jack Hartung : Yes. In terms of like comps, for example, we need about five transactions in a day to get a 1% comp. And so if you get three, four additional transactions in a 15 minute period, do that for multiple periods, you can easily add up the math and you can get 2%, 3% additional comp in all those restaurants that are seeing that additional flow through. In terms of leverage, David, I'd have to go through the math. Generally, as you add two, three additional transactions, you're going to see tens of basis points, you're not going to see 100 basis points or anything like that, you're going to see tens of basis points of leverage on the labor line. So it's certainly nice, but it's not -- again, it's not going to get you down to anything in the sub 24% range. But keep in mind, the important thing from our margin standpoint, every single additional transaction we bring in, there is a 40% pass through down to the cash flow line. And that's how we want to grow our margins. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Lauren Silberman : Thank you. I also want to ask about throughput. So one of the key initiatives being the right cadence of digital orders, to what extent have you rolled out that specific initiative across the system or what percentage of the system do you see opportunity to improve that labor allocation? Brian Niccol : You're referring to the digital make line and our smart pickup times. Yes, it seems like it's about half of our restaurants right now. And we're seeing great outcomes from that. We're being more on time, more accurate with our digital business. And where we have the correct deployment or aces in places on the frontline, we're seeing some nice improvement in number of entrees per 15 minutes. So we still have work to do, though, on executing the deployment on the front line, so that people don't leave their position. But for the most part, we're seeing really nice progress on the on-time and accuracy on the DML. And we're seeing some throughput gains on the frontline. But I think there's opportunity for us to get even better as we keep people in position during the entire peak that they're faced with. Lauren Silberman : Great. And just you've historically I believe talked about peak throughput being high 20 or low 30 orders per peak 15 minute period. Have you worked to return to those levels? Is there room to exceed prior peak throughput as you now utilize a second make line for a much greater level? Are there any constraints at that high 20, low 30 order level across the restaurant? Thank you. Brian Niccol : The good news is there's no real constraint. We've got the opportunity to exceed that. Obviously, when we were doing those numbers that was when the entire business was off the frontline. So the good news is no bottleneck. The other really piece of good news is if that does occur, we got a significantly bigger business than what we have today. So we think there's a lot of room for growth. We just got to execute this throughput program with excellence on the frontline. Just with all of our team directors, frankly, this morning and it's the number one initiative on everybody's mind; great people, great food, great throughput. We do those three things we're going to continue to drive growth from operations. Lauren Silberman : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you very much. The question is related to throughput, but I think it's more specifically on unmet demand. And I was wondering if your data specifically on the digital make lines side showed how much unmet demand that you actually may have based on the wait times that are quoted to customers? In other words, they get to the end of the transaction, they see a wait time and they just don't complete the transaction. Is that something you can measure? And related to that, do you have a sense of how many stores actually are at capacity, maybe still in midtown Manhattan and in some other places where people do walk by a line that has 15 or 20 people in it perhaps and just go to a place that's less. Is there a way to kind of quantify as you see it today the amount of unmet demand that you would serve if you could serve? In other words, if you were kind of fast or if you order time to less, what have you, just the opportunity on your current store base? Brian Niccol : Yes. John, we don't have the ability today for the in-restaurant, although we're talking about it. We're talking about some of the tools that there may be some ways for us to capture the data, not only in terms of like how many customers are waiting at the end of the 15 minute period, which that would be the opportunity, as well as how well we're executing on the frontline. So we're talking about developing those tools. We do know, historically, though, when we drive faster throughput, that we do flow more people not just through the 15 minute period, but we get a lot of incremental transactions as well. So historically, we know that people do -- they walk away from our lines. You can see it anecdotally. When you're in the midtown restaurant, when you see a long line and you see somebody walked by, open up the door and then walk away, that's a lost transaction. We're not able to quantify that specifically, but we know it happens a lot. John Ivankoe : Do you know that on the digital side? Your transactions that kind of get to the final like percentage of transactions that maybe aren't just completed that are right at the point of payment. I don't know if that's exactly the way to look at it, but there must be a leading indicator to some degree? Brian Niccol : We do have that on the digital side. And your related question was how many restaurants are at capacity? We were able to flex capacity in the restaurant by adding staff. So we will have between one and four people on the DML. And so if you have a very, very busy restaurant on a digital line, you will have as many as four people on that line, including one dedicated person that's going to run an order back and forth. So we have very few restaurants and very few individual periods within our restaurants that are maxed out from a digital standpoint. John Ivankoe : Okay. And clearly you can see the faster you are the more customers you serve this current set of [indiscernible] proved that once again. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Mullan with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Brian Mullan : Thank you. Just a question on loyalty. Could you talk about some of the key near-term objectives the team is focused on with the program over say next 12 to 24 months on the path towards I think the ultimate long-term goal of greater personalization over time, which Brian I think you've referred to in the past is still a big opportunity? Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So the team is focused on taking all the analytics and the insights that we are seeing and figuring out how we commercialize those learnings in a way that's very personalized for the individual. So a simple example, the suggestive sell. When you get ready to check out, if we know historically you do buy a Mexican coke and we don't see a Mexican coke in your basket, the suggestive sell will be from Mexican coke. And then we see when we do that, we get a higher take obviously on the suggestive sell. So it's simple things that actually we know we can commercialize, done in a very personalized way. And that's what the team is centered on is how do we do this throughout the user experience from the moment you enter your ordering process, the moment you're trying to pay on your way out? And the good news is the team's got a lot of analytics that we're cranking through, and we're knocking off the things that we think are the highest leverage points over the next call it 18 to 24 months. Brian Mullan : Okay. Thank you. And just wonder if you could just update us on the dual sided grills, maybe how many locations that have been rolled out to? And are the benefits proven to be what you might have hoped inside the stores? And if so, when could this be rolled out more broadly? Brian Niccol : Yes. So we're still in 10 restaurants. And this is why I use the stage gate process, because we've definitely -- one of the things we've learned is the energy needed to run these dual sided grills is going to require some electrical upgrades that we originally had planned on. So we got to understand exactly what is the cost of the equipment, not only to purchase, but then to actually install? And so we're still working through how do we make the economics of this makes sense? The crew likes it, the culinary turns out to be great. But we have to do some work on the economics of it. Brian Mullan : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Brian Harbour : Yes. Thank you. Could you maybe just comment on the delivery channel, and then also just kind of mobile order and pickup and some of the things you're doing with timing or orders per 15 minutes, if that's kind of affected volumes at all? Brian Niccol : So it's kind of a general question. I'll see if this may be answers your question. But what we see is the delivery business pretty stable. The order ahead and pickup business continues to be something that we are very much focused on being on-time and accurate. And that's why we've implemented this smarter pickup times where we are moving, how many orders we allow in per 10 minutes as well as the buffer, so that our crew can execute those digital orders with excellence without having to impact giving the frontline a great experience. And we're seeing nice progress on both fronts, which I mentioned earlier. We're more on time, more accurate and we're seeing gains on the throughput side of things on the frontline. And we're not seeing a step back in any conversion rates in that digital business as well. So it's full steam ahead and we got to execute the operating platform. Brian Harbour : Okay. To just Chipotlanes, are you still seeing kind of the same unit volume uplift that you've previously talked about for those kind of the same impact on returns? Is it in fact going up? Any comments on how we think about the Chipotlane impact, especially as we kind of think about next year? Jack Hartung : Yes. The Chipotlane volume has gotten closer to the non-Chipotlane volumes. And keep in mind, a lot of these were open during the pandemic when the Chipotlane was really a premium, a preferred access channel during that time. But keep in mind we're comparing a little bit of apples and oranges too because in the early days of Chipotlane, we had a lot of trade areas that could accommodate Chipotlane and yet we weren't putting a Chipotlane at every single restaurant. Now the only restaurants that don't have a Chipotlane tend to be a downtown area and inline location where you can't have a Chipotlane. So we\u2019re comparing a little bit of apples and oranges. Having said that, the margin is much better because you've got a lot more -- you got more of your business that's going through the digital channel, which is a more efficient channel for us. And the other thing that happens is you still have about a 10% ship where your delivery is dropping by 8 to 10 points or something like that and your order ahead is increasing by 8, 10 points or so. So our customers are choosing the convenience channel, which also is a value channel, which is also a very efficient channel for us to run in that order head and they\u2019re deselecting the delivery channel. Brian Harbour : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia : Hi. Good afternoon. I guess going back to throughput, I know in the past you've quantified kind of where you are relative to 2019 on peak throughput. I was hoping perhaps we could get an update on that. And then I guess I'm also wondering is 2019 really the right benchmark anymore just given how the business has shifted? You're doing double digital versus 2019 and we know that's causing some tension between the front and back line. So is that the right bogey? Do you have a slice of restaurants that have exceeded 2019 peak throughput or is that not the right answer anymore? Jack Hartung : Sharon, it's a great question. When we use 2019 as a benchmark, we actually adjusted it for the fact that today's volume is at basically 60%, 62% of the business goes through the frontline versus back in 2019, it was about 80% or 81% or 82% or so. So we've adjusted for that volume. So for example, the average throughput in 2019 was in that high 20% range, 28% to 29%. When you adjust it for 62% of the volume going through the frontline, that bogey ends up being on an adjusted basis more like a 25 to mid 20s. And so we do have the right targets for our teams because we did volume adjust it. In terms of where we are, we've been making incremental improvements. We're now at right around at 22. But we're still three transactions -- two and a half to three transactions before our goal. The good news as Brian mentioned, we're seeing a lot of progress in terms of the right deployment. We're seeing that a lot of our restaurants are executing core four, core four meaning they've got at least four folks, if not more on the frontline. Previous, we saw most restaurants would have three or sometimes even less than that. And now our teams are focusing on what are the habits that drive great throughput, because having four people on the frontline is an enabler, but it doesn't mean you're going to deliver great throughput. You have to stay on that frontline and then you have to have all the tricks that we're not going to go through right now and all the techniques to deliver great throughput. We're starting to see individual restaurants or patches of restaurants that are executing core four and their throughput numbers are three to four or more transactions grade are in a 15 minute period than restaurants in the same patch that are not executing the core four. So we're seeing really encouraging results. And it\u2019s that three or four transactions here that gets you from the 22 up to the mid 20. So we do feel like we're triangulating around the right target. Sharon Zackfia : Okay. And then I guess the question on the guidance for the quarter on comps. I know you had kind of some weather and some disappointment around the holidays last year. Jack, are you factoring that in to the guidance for this year or are you just kind of steady stating? Jack Hartung : What we've done, Sharon, is taken our current trends from October and then pushing them forward. We do take into account what we did last year. But rather than taking account last year, is that going to affect our comp either up or down, we really take our current trends which includes Carne Asada and includes the menu price increase and it includes the current underlying transaction trend. We use that trend to trend out for the rest of the year. Compared to last year to the extent that there was some weather, we see individual days or weeks where there's weather, our comp is going to bounce up during those periods. But we didn't use last year's weather to say it's going to be any better or worse. Sharon Zackfia : Okay, great. Thank you. Jack Hartung : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Danilo Gargiulo : Thank you. First of all, a quick clarification in light of your comments on the Chipotlane. So I'm assuming that the 40% flow through is the average in your system. So are you seeing any mixed benefits in the 40% as you're getting more and more stores which Chipotlanes any new trade areas? So could we be talking about 42%, 43% flow through in the near future? Jack Hartung : Yes, that's correct, Danilo. In a Chipotlane, the margins are better and then the incremental margins are better. So you should see a few ticks up when we have incremental transactions in Chipotlane definitely. Danilo Gargiulo : Great. And then with potential increase in value offerings from some of your large peers, do you think that the industry is moving toward more elevated level of promotional intensity to attract and retain traffic? And if so, are you expecting Chipotle to be able to leverage the same pricing power that they did last year? Brian Niccol : What we center on is providing a great experience. And what we've seen is that results in superior value. And unfortunately, we aren't doing it through price promotion, rather we're doing it through great culinary, lots of customization, terrific speed. And that's where our value for the consumer really shines through. And then given the scale that we have, we're able to buy ingredients and provide people with a clean eating experience that frankly you can\u2019t get anywhere else for the price at which we charge it. So very affordable, very customizable, super high quality is resulting in really strong value scores from consumers. And then when we look at our relative price position to competitors, right now we're anywhere from 15% to 30% discount on an everyday standard. It\u2019s also kind of interesting that the team did just to kind of dimensionalize this. They took a look at 18 to 34 year olds that actually have student debt. And what we found is Chipotle was the best value proposition among that universe. So one of the things we're seeing is whatever situation you're in, whether it's low income, higher income with some student debt, we continue to be a strong value proposition, regardless where you look across the consumer segments. Danilo Gargiulo : Makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jeff Bernstein : Great. Thank you. Two questions. First, Brian, I'm sure you're getting this question periodically. I think I saw some headlines on CNBC earlier about it. But just the topic of anti-obesity drugs as a headwind, I think you had mentioned that you're not seeing anything to date. But it would seem like you're perhaps more vulnerable than others, just because maybe you have a slightly higher income cohort. I'm just wondering how you assess whether there was any impact or what you might do differently if that was a future headwind, maybe get a heading of it with focus on a healthier offering that we know you have. Just how you think about how it's being impacted and how you would respond? And then I had one follow up? Brian Niccol : Sure. So yes, that's right. We've not seen any material impact from it. And as I understand the drug and when I've spoken to people that know a whole lot more about the drug than I do, our food is a good solution. Because it's clean, it's not fried. It allows people then to customize meal that would fit their diet that they're trying to achieve, whether they're on GLP-1 drugs or whether they're on a keto diet or a Whole30 diet or insert the lifestyle diet that they're on, or the lifestyle drug that they might be on, the good news is we're positioned to be able to customize that diet for you with clean food done in a very healthy way. So longer term, I think we're positioned really well. We'll see how this continues to unfold. But today, we've seen no real impact. And the best thing we can do is make sure that we stay committed to food with integrity and providing those customized solutions at speed. Jeff Bernstein : Got it. And then, Jack, just in terms of the fourth quarter or maybe more importantly looking to 2024, your commodity and labor inflation, what's kind of the forecast you're assuming when you talk about kind of approaching that 27% restaurant margin? I know you talked about how California labor loan is 250 to 300 basis points, but just wondering what assumption you have for inflation on commodities and labor for next year? Thank you. Jack Hartung : Yes. Jeff, you know that\u2019s predicting anything, especially inflation in the last few years has been very, very difficult. Right now, it looks like inflation is settling for both our ingredients and for labor in that call it 3%-ish, maybe between 3% and 4%, something like that. That's a very normal environment. If it stays at that 3% to 4% range, I think that's just fine. We can operate very effectively in that environment. Would we be able to get all the way to 27% without taking any additional pricing? That'd be tough unless our transactions accelerate, and we can leverage -- throw some more leverage along our fixed line items. But if it's in that 3% to 4% range, we just took a 3% price increase, I think we'll be just fine. But if it continues at a higher level, obviously, that'd be a little tougher. But anyway, if it ends up in that 3% to 4% range and people keep their jobs and people still want to dine out, we'd like our chances that they'll keep coming to Chipotle, especially based on the most recent trends that we've seen. Jeff Bernstein : Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please go ahead. Peter Saleh : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I want to come back to your comments on the Hyphen make line. I think you said it increases capacity, better accuracy and better speed. What are the challenges and some of the hurdles that you think you need to overcome at this point to move it to the next stage and the stage gate process? Brian Niccol : Yes, so thanks for the question. So we had our first prototype at our Cultivate Center. And the team did a great job of kind of pressure testing all aspects of it. We learned a lot, right? There's work to be done on how you expo things, there's work to be done on how you clean it, there's work to be done on how we actually provide portions. And the good news is this is why we use the stage gate process so that we learn, we iterate and then hopefully we get to a faster solution. So I'm excited to see what the next prototype holds. But the team is working on some of those key things that we learned on. But yes, look, all signs are really promising that as we continue to work on this in the stage gate, what we're after is accuracy, speed and then the ability for the team member to execute this both at the expo station and then keep it clean and food safe. So we're working through those things. But for a very first prototype, the team did a great job. And I loved everybody's passion to learn so that we get to an even better second generation prototype. Peter Saleh : Great. And then just my last question would be on, have you seen any difference in sales performance for the urban versus suburban stores these days? Is the return to office, are you seeing any improvement there? Just any clarity around that would be helpful. Thank you. Jack Hartung : Yes, the comps have gotten a lot closer. The urban still outperformed the suburban by about 100 basis points or something like that. So it's much, much, much closer. But I would say the central business districts are still behind. In terms of an absolute sales basis if you look at pre-pandemic and where we are today, the central business districts are still behind. But from a comp standpoint, they're performing in the same general range. Peter Saleh : Thank you very much. Jack Hartung : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Brian Niccol : Thank you. And thanks everybody for the questions and joining the call. Obviously, we're very proud of our teams and the results that we've delivered in the third quarter. It's very exciting to see our efforts on throughput driven by having the team's staff trained and deployed correctly, continuing to make progress and then with our strong value proposition, seeing that show up in transactions as the driver of growth. We're going to continue to stay focused on executing great throughput.  We're going to continue to stay focused on great culinary. We're going to continue to stay focused on having great people that are trained and know exactly what they need to do in their position. So very excited about the results we've achieved but very optimistic about our future, both in building new units and continuing to drive average unit volumes and margins. So thank you for taking the time and we'll see you in a couple months. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Olsen, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead. Cindy Olsen : Hello, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal year end 2024 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations Web site at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our actual results could differ materially from those projections in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire Executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian Niccol : Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered outstanding results this year, driven by our focus on exceptional people, exceptional food and exceptional throughput. This is driving a much better experience for our teams and our guests and resulted in accelerating transaction growth throughout 2023. For the year, sales grew 14% to reach $9.9 billion driven by a 7.9% comp. Digital sales represented 37% of sales. Restaurant level margin was 26.2%, an increase of 230 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $44.86 representing 37% growth over last year and we opened a record 271 new restaurants including 238 Chipotlanes. We also ended the year with a lot of momentum as demonstrated by our fourth quarter results. Our restaurant teams are making terrific progress in building a strong foundation around throughput and the return of Carne Asada as a limited time offer outperformed our expectations. For the quarter, sales grew 15% to $2.5 billion driven by 8.4% comp. Digital sales represented 36% of sales. Restaurant level margin was 25.4%, an increase of 140 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $10.36, representing 25% growth over last year. And we opened a record 121 new restaurants, including 110 Chipotlanes. As a reminder, we are returning to our pre-pandemic practice of only providing annual comp guidance. While January was impacted by weather throughout much of the country, as weather has normalized, our sales trends have strengthened. For the full year, we anticipate comps in the mid-single digit range, as we continue to focus on the same five key strategies that help us to win today while we grow our future. Now let me provide an update on each of these strategies, which include, number one, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level. Number two, running successful restaurants with a people-accountable culture that provides great food with integrity, while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences. Number three, making the brand visible, relevant and loved to improve overall guest engagement. Number four, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity of our restaurants, support centers, and in our supply chain. And number five, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings in North America and internationally. Starting with our world class people, I'm excited to share that Ilene Eskenazi joined my executive leadership team in November as our Chief Human Resources Officer, with over 25 years of experience in leading human resources and legal functions across a wide range of industries. I am confident Ilene will be instrumental in helping Chipotle develop and retain talent at every level of the organization and enhance the support we provide to our people, both in our restaurants and at our support centers. Strengthening Chipotle as a best-in-class employer. As I've said in the past, we want to attract and retain the best people that we can develop and grow. Part of this includes listening to their needs and investing in ways that will help our employees thrive both professionally and personally. This is why we recently added new benefits to our industry-leading benefits platform, like enhanced mental health care, a student loan retirement match, and additional financial wellness tools for our workforce. In addition to our benefits, our long-term growth opportunity and promote from within culture provides a path for team members to advance quickly within Chipotle. In fact, in 2023, we promoted over 24, 000 people, and over 90% of all restaurant management roles were internal promotions. This includes 87% of field leader positions, which is one of the biggest jumps for our teams, going from running one restaurant to an average of eight restaurants. The ability to achieve this rate of internal promotions is a result of our strong restaurant leaders, many of whom started as crew members and who are committed to training and developing our future leaders. A great example is one of our field leaders in New York who has been with Chipotle for over 16 years. He helped to develop and promote over 40 team members who have grown within Chipotle and have gone on to become some of our best general managers, field leaders, team directors, and even one of our regional vice presidents. This is the type of person who will help us to deliver on our goals of running great restaurants, delivering industry leading economics, and expanding to 7, 000 restaurants in North America longer term. Great people executing great culinary and throughput results in a terrific guest experience and drives performance. And this brings me to our operations. Strong leadership is the key to running successful restaurants with fast throughput. So it is no surprise that the restaurants with the most tenured general managers are executing the best. The good news is our GM turnover is at some of the lowest levels that I have seen since I joined Chipotle. And over the last couple quarters, we have put the building blocks in place to deliver great throughput. As we mentioned last quarter, we have adjusted the cadence of orders on the digital make line to achieve a better balance of labor between the two lines. Additionally, we began collecting data on the execution of the four pillars of throughput in our restaurants and providing feedback and coaching on a weekly basis. This is allowing our restaurant teams to see progress, which is energizing and motivating as the experience of winning catches momentum. And finally, our teams now have real time access to their Max 15 throughput results in the moment. So our GMs can coach and recognize great throughput while it is happening. Since we put these coaching tools in place in the third quarter, we have seen the number of restaurants with at least four crew members on the front line during peak periods improve from 30% to around 50%. This is driving an acceleration in our throughput performance as the number of entrees in our peak 15 minutes improved by a full point in the fourth quarter compared to last year. I am thrilled to see the progress we are beginning to make and continuing this momentum is critical as we approach our peak burrito season in mid-March. We will also further strengthen our industry leading value proposition, which consists of delicious culinary, made with real ingredients, that is customizable, convenient, serve quickly, and an accessible price point. When we were executing on all parts of our value proposition, we were providing a great customer experience that would help all other drivers of sales perform better, such as menu and innovation. And last year, Chicken al Pastor and Carne Asada, both surpassed our expectations in drove incremental transactions. This is a testament to the cross-functional effort by our marketing, culinary, supply chain, and restaurant teams that do an outstanding job innovating, as well as bringing back past favorites that are more delicious each time and are executed seamlessly. 2024 will be another exciting year for menu innovation, including one to two limited time offers and rolling out creative ways to shine a spotlight on our core menu throughout the year. As part of highlighting the core, we recently launched our latest lineup of lifestyle bowls, which shows how the customization of our real ingredients allows Chipotle to embrace all interpretations of wellness, whether it be plant-based, high protein, keto, paleo, and more. In connection with the launch, we announced a partnership with Strava, the leading digital community for active people with more than 120 million athletes, to encourage and reward healthy habits with a chance to earn free lifestyle goals. This is giving our fans the right tools to sustain healthy habits in 2024 and beyond. In addition to menu innovation, our marketing team continues to do a fantastic job of making the Chipotle brand more visible, more relevant, and more loved to drive difference, culture, and drive a purchase. Our Behind the Foil campaign is a great example as it highlights key differentiators of Chipotle. This includes our restaurant teams preparing our real ingredients, made fresh every day using classic culinary techniques, such as dicing onions and jalapenos, hand-mashing our signature guac, and grilling our adobo chicken, steak, and fajita veggies on the Plancha. We will continue to evolve the Behind the Foil campaign in 2024, and it's really exciting to see that our best performing ads are an authentic, behind the scenes look into a day in the life of a Chipotle team member. This certainly demonstrates one of our core values, which is authenticity was here. Our food is real, and so are we. Shifting to amplifying technology innovation, we have made a lot of progress this year on improving the digital experience. We made several enhancements to our app functionality, including order readiness messaging, wrong location detection, reminders to scan for points to check out, prior order history and more. This has helped to reduce friction points and improve the overall experience for guests. We also launched Freepotle for our rewards members, which was successful in driving engagement and enrolling new members as we were able to surprise and delight our guests with free rewards such as guac, a beverage, or double meat. From the Freepotle drops, we were able to learn more about our rewards members to improve our ability to deliver relevant experiences in the future. Finally, we recently rolled out suggestive upsell on our app at checkout, based on data we have on our rewards members including prior order history. Going forward, I believe we are on a multiyear path to commercializing our customer data and insights into more targeted marketing campaigns and improving the overall digital experience that will drive increased frequency and spend over time. I also wanted to spend a few minutes providing an update on our Cultivate Next Fund which launched two years ago with an objective of making early-stage investments into strategically aligned companies that further our mission to cultivate a better world and accelerate our strategic priorities. Since launching this fund, the amount of innovation that we have seen across the food tech landscape has surpassed our expectations and encompasses everything from farming to supply chain to alternative proteins and oils to in-restaurant automation and more. We have reviewed hundreds of innovative companies and have made seven investments of which there are many opportunities for commercial engagements. This includes Hyphen, which we are partnering with to develop our automated digital make line and Vebu which we are partnering with to develop Autocado that cuts cores and scoops avocados. Both Hyphen and Autocado could help to improve the overall experience for our teams by removing less favorable tasks and for our guests by providing on time accurate and delicious food. We continue to work on iterations of each technology at our Cultivate Center. And the good news is that we plan to pilot the automated digital make line and Autocado in a restaurant in 2024 as part of our stage gate process. Last month, we announced two more investments in Greenfield Robotics and Nitricity. Greenfield Robotics provides regenerative agriculture solutions without chemicals using fleets of autonomous robots to weed fields. And Nitricity uses technology to tackle greenhouse gas emissions by creating natural fertilizer products that are better for fields, farmers, and the environment. We believe both Greenfield Robotics and Nitricity could play an important role in ensuring a more sustainable future for farms within our supply chain. Our suppliers are a key enabler of Chipotle's growth and help us to further our purpose of cultivating a better world. We will continue to find innovative ways to support their ability to grow, harvest, and supply the high quality, sustainably raised real ingredients that Chipotle serves. Our final strategic pillar is expanding access and our development team has done an incredible job of meeting our development targets despite the timeline challenges we continue to see. In the fourth quarter, we opened 121 new restaurants and for the full year, we opened 271 new restaurants, which is the highest number of openings in the company's history in a single quarter and in a single year. We have now surpassed 800 Chipotlanes and continue to see very strong results with Chipotlanes driving higher new restaurant productivity, margins, and returns. Additionally, this year, we had some fantastic openings in new markets with our first restaurant in Calgary breaking an opening day record and sustaining very high volumes post opening day. When we serve delicious food with exceptional operations and execute great local marketing, our brand gains traction quickly, and Canada is a testament to this. We will continue to accelerate our growth in Canada in 2024, with 10 to 14 new restaurant openings planned, representing 25% to 35% growth for the country, and in total we continue to target 285 to 315 new restaurant openings in 2024, mostly in North America, with over 80% including at Chipotlane. So, to conclude, I want to thank our 115, 000 employees for their hard work which drove strong results in 2023. We hit some big milestones, including surpassing 3, 400 restaurants, 800 Chipotlanes, $3 million in AUVs, and forming our first international partnership. As I look forward, I see the opportunity longer term to more than double our restaurants in North America, increase our penetration of Chipotlanes, surpass $4 million in AUVs, expand our industry leading margins and returns and further our purpose of cultivating a better world globally. As I mentioned in the beginning, this ambitious plan will require exceptional people, exceptional food, and exceptional throughput. The good news is that I am certainly at the right people and the right strategy to achieve it. So with that, I will turn it over to Jack. Jack Hartung : Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the fourth quarter grew 15% year-over-year to reach $2.5 billion as comp sales grew 8.4% driven by over 7% transaction growth. Restaurant level margin of 25.4% increased about 140 basis points compared to last year, and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $10.36 representing 25% year-over-year growth. The fourth quarter had unusual expenses related to elevated depreciation and changes to illegal contingency. Looking at fiscal 2024, we anticipate comps in the mid-single digit range for the full year. As a reminder, we were impacted by unusually cold weather throughout the country in January. As the weather has normalized, our underlying sales trends remain strong and they support our full year guidance range. Additionally, Q1 will include the benefit of an extra day due to leap year, but this will be offset by Easter shifting into Q1 this year compared to Q2 of last year. I'll now go through the key P&L line items beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 29.7%, an increase of about 40 basis points from last year. A larger mixed shift to beef due to the success of Carne Asada as well as elevated cost across the board most notably beef produce and queso was partially offset by the benefit of menu price increases and lower paper costs. For Q1, we expect our cost of sales to be in the low 29% range as the benefit of the mixed shift out of Carne Asada will be partially offset by higher costs across several line items, most notably avocados and tortillas. We anticipate cost of sales inflation to be in the low to mid-single digit range for the full year. Labor costs for the fourth quarter were 25%, a decrease of about 60 basis points. points from last year. The benefit of sales leverage and better labor execution more than offset wage inflation and higher performance-based compensation. For Q1, we expect our labor costs to be in the low 25% range with wage inflation and the low to mid-single digit range. And we anticipate wage inflation will tick up to the mid-single digit range as California wages go up around 20% in April this year. Other operating costs for the quarter were 14.7%, a decrease of about 100 basis points from last year. The decrease was driven by sales leverage as well as lower marketing and promo cost which were 3.1% of sales in Q4, a decrease of about 30 basis points from last year. In Q1, we expect marketing costs to be in the low 3% range with full year to come in right around 3%. In Q1, other operating costs are expected to be in the high 14% range. G&A for the quarter was $169 million on a GAAP basis or $170 million on a non -GAAP basis, excluding about $1 million change in illegal contingency. G&A also include $122 million in underlying G&A, $36 million related to non-cash stock compensation, $10 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes on equity investing and exercises, and $2 million related to our upcoming All Manager Conference, which is scheduled for Q1 of this year. We expect our underlying G&A to be around $127 million in Q1 and step up each quarter as we make investments in people and technology to support our ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will be around $32 million in Q1, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance and is subject to the final 2024 grants which are issued in Q1. We also expect to recognize around $7 million related to employer taxes associated with shares divest during the quarter and $21 million for costs associated with our bi annual All Manager Conference in March, bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q1 to around $187 million. Adjusted depreciation for the quarter was $79 million or 3.1% of sales, and for 2024 we expect it to remain right around this level as a percent of sales. Our effective tax rate for Q4 was 26.2% for both GAAP and non-GAAP and for 2024 we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items. Our balance sheet remains strong as we enter the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash, restricting the cash and investments with no debt, and during the fourth quarter, we repurchased $144 million of our stock at an average price of $1, 936. For the full year, we repurchased a total of $590 million at an average price of $1, 827, and going forward we'll continue to opportunistically repurchase our stock. During the quarter, our Board authorized an additional $200 million for our share authorization program, and at the end of the quarter we had $424 million remaining. We opened a record 121 new restaurants in the fourth quarter, of which 110 had a Chipotlane, and as we mentioned last quarter, we anticipate opening between 285 and 315 new restaurants in 2024, with over 80% having a Chipotlane. We continue to see developers delaying projects due to macro pressures and high interest rates, along with permitting, inspection, and utility installation delays. The midpoint of our guidance range assumes these challenges persist, and we remain on track to move towards the high end of the 8% to 10% range by 2025, assuming conditions do not worsen. In closing, Chipotle is a purpose-driven company that has been able to scale over the last 30 years into one of the largest restaurant brands in the world. An exciting part is that we still have a long growth runway in front of us. Our strong economic model gives us a high degree of confidence that our ambitious growth objectives are achievable, if not beatable. And as we continue to protect and strengthen our economic model, our long-term growth opportunity will only expand just as it has over the last 30 years. So thank you to all of our employees for their hard work and their dedication to Chipotle, and let's keep the momentum going in 2024. With that, we'll open the lines for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Andrew Charles with TD Cowan. Andrew Charles : Great, thanks. Brian, I appreciate the ambitions that you talk about the $4 million AUVs and I think the same drivers that were used to reach the $3 million level are still the largest drivers to get to the $4 million level which includes operations, marketing, loyalty to Chipotlane and many innovations. But if you look back from several years from now and you get to that $4 million fast and expected, what driver do you work better than it has in recent years or maybe you think about it differently, are there new drivers that will help you get to the $4 million level such as catering, breakfast or automation and then Jack, I have a follow-up? Brian Niccol : Yes, thanks for the question. Look, I do believe at the end of the day the thing that will get us to $4 million and probably beyond that is going to be great execution in the restaurant meaning focusing on great culinary, great people and great throughput. I think we're very fortunate that it doesn't require another day part, it doesn't require something that we aren't currently doing today to achieve that result. I do think things like automation like Hyphen and Autocado and continuing to do things with our rewards program, the menu innovation, the marketing will obviously be things that push us further and further but one thing I think that we demonstrated this last quarter is when we perform better on the operation front all those things I just listed off, have a, I would call it almost like a multiplying effect. So the good news is we still have a lot of headroom to go on operational execution, and I think we've got the right things in place for the long term to get us to that $4 million and beyond. Andrew Charles : Helpful. And then, Jack, my questions are on the mechanics to get to that $4 million level. I mean, do you expect staying within, with the same store sales to get there, or do you think the law of large numbers kicks in at some point in the out years that low single digits the right rate of same store sales growth? And similarly, what kind of margins do you think the business can support at $4 million volumes assuming normalized commodity and labor inflation? Jack Hartung : Yes, Andrew, it's really hard to predict over a long period of time into the future what comps are going to do. I think for the foreseeable future, our guidance next year in the mid-single digit I think makes sense. But if you look at our history, we have a history of having outsized comps when the economy is going well, I think makes sense. But if you look at our history, we have a history of having outsized comps when the economy is going well, when our operations are going well. I would argue even the acceleration we saw in the fourth quarter was we had a great combination of demand being created by Carne Asada, what's become a favorite of our customers, and throughput allowing those sales to flow through. Those are the -- and I would expect those things to happen in the future that are very hard to predict how and when they're going to happen, Andrew. But those are the things that Chipotle has seen in the past, and I think that will likely happen in the future as well. So the $4 million while it's in a mid-single -digit is something we think we definitely will get there. From the margins, I would expect margins to continue to expand. We still expect to see a pass-through every time we grow our transaction, grow our sales through additional customers. About a 40% flow-through, as that 40% gets averaged in against the 26% we delivered last year, I would expect the margins to go up. And as we get up to $4 million, I would expect we'd be in the high 20%, maybe even in a 30% range. Again, you're talking about predicting something over a very long period of time, but our margins will definitely get stronger over time, which means our returns will get stronger as well as we move from $3 million to $4 million. Operator : The next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. David Tarantino : Hi. Good afternoon. And congratulations on a great 2023. My question is really about the unit growth, and I've got two parts to that. I think you've been talking about 7, 000 restaurants in North America for a while, and as you build more and more Chipotlanes and see the returns you're getting, I'm just wondering if that number could prove low in your mind. Is there upside to the 7, 000 over time? And then I guess the second part of the question is I know you want to grow faster and Jack, you mentioned getting to 10% unit growth next year is a goal. I'm just wondering what line of sight you have to that at this point that you can share with us. Thanks. Brian Niccol : Yes, why don't I go ahead and get started, David, and then I'll let Jack fill in. Look, the way we've come to the 7, 000 number is we've looked at, what our penetration levels are. And in some of the places where we had the most penetration, we continue to build restaurants with success, which then gives us the confidence to do the exercise to say, okay, well, if you just apply that math to the rest of the country, we quickly add up to 7, 000. So we think it's a very practical goal. Some might say conservative, but we definitely think it's a practical goal. And, probably as we get closer, I think Jack's talked about this in the past. At one point we were talking about having 3, 000 Chipotlane then we said 4, 000 and we said 5, 000. Here we are at 7, 000. I hope it does prove to be conservative. I think the brand's got a lot of upsides in it, but that's how we get to the 7, 000. Jack Hartung : Yes, then David, on how do you get to 10 %? Our visibility is quite good. Our inventory building that the teams have been doing is really, really strong. In fact, the team has had to build more inventory than we normally would need to basically offset these timelines. These timelines have really delayed everything so that you're talking about instead of 15, 16 months, from when you get a deal to open. It's not more like 21, 22 months or so. But each year the team builds a stronger inventory. The result of the new openings has been outstanding. So the quality has been very, very high. So the inventory itself looks really, really good. And if we get any break in terms of timelines with the quality has been very, very high. So the inventory itself looks really, really good. And if we get any break in terms of timelines with developers moving a little bit faster with local authorities in terms of utilities, in terms of permitting, if that was a little bit faster, we actually can get to that clip even a little sooner. But we built in the exact same extended timeline that we're seeing today with the current very robust inventory. And that will get us, if not all the way, very close to that 10% figure. David Tarantino : And just a quick follow-up, Jack. Are you seeing any signs at all that the timelines could be getting a little bit shorter? Any signs of life there? Jack Hartung : Not anything sustained, David. So, I mean, our teams are working really, really hard at it. The most recent challenges been developers with high interest rates. They're pausing a little bit. I do think if interest rates improve this year, I do think that will help. But nothing that I would bank on right now. We're certainly working hard at it, though. Operator : The next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank. Lauren Silberman : Thank you. So, I wanted to ask too, one on throughput, clearly a big area focus driver of traffic this year. Can you talk about how you see the potential traffic opportunity in \u201824 driven by throughput and just the priorities to get there to further unlock that opportunity? Brian Niccol : Yes, well, obviously, we're really delighted to see, over seven points of transaction growth in the fourth quarter. I think that's a testament to operations teams in the field having a focus on getting great throughput. And we've talked about this quite a bit. Now, there's the four pillars of great throughput. I'd say we're kind of still in the early stages of this because we're just getting people in position. So, I think you heard my comments about, hey, we now have four people on the front line, almost 50% of the time. That's only one component of the four pillars. And I'll, if you really think about it, right? It's that's part of our idea of nascent some class. Like we want to be prepared, people in position ready to go. So we still have a lot of upsides on making sure that we have the expo, the linebacker in position and ready to go. So we're -- we still think we're early, early days on this. There's a lot of upsides to it. I am delighted to see the progress though. We've increased our Max 15 pretty much every month throughout 2023 and saw some of our best results in December and those trends continued into January. So lots of space to still grow into. But the thing I love is that the teams are laser focused on getting after it. I think we've now given them more tools that they have better visibility on how they're performing real time. And, I get to visit restaurants is the first thing that's on people's minds. How are we doing on our throughput? How are we doing on our culinary? And how are we doing with the people and culture? So it's nice to see. Lauren Silberman : Great. Thank you. And if I could ask on quick one on menu innovation, how you're thinking about it. I know you mentioned one to two this year. I know you typically do an LTO on chicken and this spring and then beef later in the fall. Any change to how you're thinking about cadence, especially as you consider sort of throughput and operations? Brian Niccol : Yes. I mean, look, I think what we demonstrated this past year is that's definitely a cadence that our operators can execute great throughput with. So, they delivered Pollo Asado with excellence. And then they did the same thing. I'm sorry, Chicken al Pastor with excellence. And then followed that up with Carne Asada. So, we feel really good about doing one or two a year. I think you're also going to see us this year do a little bit more spotlighting, even on the core menu, which we're doing right now with our lifestyle bowls. And then you'll see us do that as well during the year. So we think we've got the right cadence, we think we've got the right innovation pipeline, and also the things that we've done in the past we've demonstrated, we can revisit those with success as most recently with Carne Asada. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Brian Harbour : Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Brian, you mentioned just suggestive up self at checkout, and I was curious on that theme or maybe just a bar theme, what are some things that you think you could do to drive check, right? I think we've talked a lot about transactions, but what do you think could be check drivers as we think about this year and beyond? Brian Harbour : Yes, look, I think one of the things that's been really nice to see is the incidence of our sides has continued to go up, like queso and chips and salsa, we're continuing to see people adding onto their entrees. And I think that has a lot to do with what we're able to do digitally, both at the point of checking out as well as how we communicate with people through our rewards program, right? So, the suggestive sell example I'm talking about, we've now turned that into a smart suggestive sell. So I'll give you the best example, or a really simple one. Historically, you get a Mexican Coke with your order. When you get to check out it, if you don't have Mexican Coke in your basket, we will serve you a suggestive sell off, hey, you forgot your Mexican Coke. Versus before, we might have just been saying, hey, maybe you should think about chips and queso. So what we're seeing is that type of insight into the individual results in more commercialization or higher check as they check out, because we're serving a lot of things that they historically have usually added to their ticket. So we're seeing that make great progress. And then obviously I think our queso, chips, and guac are pretty darn special. So the more people learn and experience it, the more they want to add it to their check. Brian Harbour : Okay, great, thank you. Jack, are you willing to comment just on kind of the levels of, I guess, 1Q, maybe it looks similar to the fourth quarter, but are you willing to comment on the level of pricing you'll see just factoring in kind of California as we start to think about, perhaps the second quarter? Jack Hartung : Yes, Q1 will be similar. Call it in that 2.5% to 3% range in Q1. We haven't made a final decision, in terms of pricing with a FAST Act. We know we have to take something as a significant increase when you talk about a 20 percent-ish increase in wages. And I think we talked in the past that there's one approach where you would cover the profitability. So you would breakeven from a profitability standpoint, but not protect margins. So another word, margins would go down, profitability would not, or you could take a higher price increase and you protect margins as well. We haven't decided within that range. We'll wait and see just what the landscape looks like, what the consumer sentiment is, what other companies are going to do. So I would say in terms of the impact California represents about 15% of our restaurants. So depending on where we end up, there'd probably be an extra 80-ish, 90-ish basis point to maybe something over 100 base point in terms of additional menu price across all of our 3, 400 restaurants just to give you kind of an order of magnitude. Operator : The next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you. I was thinking about the amount of time, attention, labor hours that you spend in morning prep every day at the store level. And as the system grows, gains scale, potentially benefits from more equipment, more technology, more automation, maybe some more centralization. I was wondering for you to talk about opportunities to maybe reallocate some of this prep labor that you may have longer term, how big of a bucket is that? And obviously, Autocado is one identified solution. How much more is there and how much more could that mean to the overall business model of the future? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, thanks for the question. Obviously, prep in the morning is a critical piece of the puzzle. If we get our prep done correctly, we usually have a great lunch. Actually, we always have a great lunch when we get the prep done correctly. Usually what we run into problems is if we're running behind on prep. So things like Autocado, other robotics to help us cut the onions and the jalapenos, these things would be huge enablers. That's why you continue to see us look at all these robotic ideas to make prep even more efficient. One thing I know for sure is if we could get every restaurant 100% of the time to have their prep done on time and ready to roll, our throughput would go up. So we're going to do everything we can to ensure we're investing in prep both more efficiently and then also effectively to get it done. How you reallocate that time, we'll figure that out as we get closer to it. And that's part of the reason why we're using the stage cake process. As we put Autocado into stores, we will see how that plays out. But you mentioned centralizing kitchens on this. That's something we're not contemplating. We believe to keep the freshest food, the best culinary that needs to happen in the restaurant. Operator : The next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Sara Senatore : Thank you. A couple of follow-up questions. The first is, I wanted to go back to your comment about restaurants with for in the make line going from 30% to 50% is still a long way to go. I'm wondering if you can maybe quantify what the contributions to that seven, that increase of transaction growth, which is to say, presumably it's not like, every 20 points of staffing improvement gets you seven points of transaction growth. But if you could just maybe rank order, is it staffing or are there other things that are also going into this? And, parallel that perhaps is what you saw in the last decade when you also saw a real focus on the four pillars and improvement and throughput. Brian Niccol : Yes. So great question. Here's what I'll tell you is for sure you've got to be staffed. You've got to have stability in the teams, right? That's how we get the reps so that we execute better every time. The other thing I'll say is when we looked back and we were doing maybe our best throughput, these numbers can easily go from 50% to 60%, 70%, some odd percent in execution. So it's not unrealistic for us to believe we can get better than where we are today. And I think the teams know that. The other thing that I think is also helping the teams is to have the visibility. So they know how they performed in their 15 minutes, allows them to course correct real time versus finding out what happened that day. And then they kind of missed out on being able to course correct for a later part of lunch or dinner time. How it contributes to the comp. Here's one thing I'll tell you is we're executing better. And when we're executing better, people feel better about the food, they feel better about the brand. We just got back some brand metrics that frankly are just terrific. And I think that shows up in our value scores. And then it shows up in the way that people are feeling about the brand. So the brand has got really strong perceptions. I think our team members feel really good about the success they're having, which is also really important, right? When the crew feels like they're going fast or giving people what they want, they feel better. Which then I think in result turns into like kind of this ongoing system where everybody believes they're now achieving and getting what they want. So our customers are happier, the team members are happier, the brand is stronger. And I think these are all the things that contribute to seven points of transaction growth or said it another way really strong value proposition that we've gotten in today's environment. Sara Senatore : Got it, okay, thank you. And then just on the Carne Asada, I mean, I know in the past you've gotten questions about how do you lap a really successful LTO, but here you have it for like the third time and it was better than you expected. Is that marketing, is that digital? Because you actually, as a percentage of revenue, spent less year-over-year. So I'm just trying to understand, again, what the runway is for these already very successful LTOs. Brian Niccol : Yes, look, I think our teams executed Carne Asada, better than we ever have. I thought the experience of Carne Asada was terrific. I also do think the advertising and the communication around it was really good. So I think our ads are communicating what makes Chipotle special, which is this team member that's committed to doing great culinary in the restaurant. And then when you layer in a great product like Carne Asada that gets executed with excellence, good things happen. And, it was kind of, I think Jack mentioned this earlier, great demand generation with the advertising and the Carne Asada initiative. And then the folks in our restaurants were doing a really terrific execution so that people got down the line faster, they experienced great culinary and they got exactly what they wanted. So I think it's the combination of really having compelling menu news with great advertising and our operations team executing the fundamentals really well. Operator : The next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Danilo Gargiulo : Thank you. Can you please provide maybe some color on the key drivers of the traffic comp being procured by income cohort or maybe by channels? And if you can also comment on the average check, how much was the contribution from pricing versus contribution from mix and what's your expectation given that the delivery mix impact should be normalizing at this point? Brian Niccol : Yes. So, look, one of the things that we're really delighted to see is every income cohort we saw sales grow. So whether that's below 40, 000, between 40, 000 and 100, 000, over 100, 000, we saw progress with every income cohort. So, clearly, the brand is resonating in a meaningful way. What was the other part of this question? Jack Hartung : The channels and in-store with by far strongest channel which supports the throughput that we saw. Brian Niccol : Yes. In-store was the strongest. Order ahead was next and then delivery was third. And I think Jack was just mentioning this. The in-store experience, when we have the culinary ready to go and you go down the line, it's tough to beat. I mean, there's no better experience than walking down the line, seeing the rice and chicken that you want and then giving one of our team members the look like, how about a little more when they do it? So, I tell you, end up with these big bowls and big burritos. And so, I think the value proposition is just really strong in store, especially when we're executing great culinary and great speed. Jack Hartung : And then, Danilo, just on the check, the check impact was a 1%, plus 1%. That's about 2.5% price offset by about 1.5 on the mix and the mix is driven by group size. Danilo Gargiulo : Got it, thank you. And then you recently significantly improved the benefits and you really are offering a very strong employment value proposition to your employees. Can you talk about the labor cost and maybe productivity improvement implications that you're expecting from that initiative? And it would be great if you can maybe frame where you are in turnover levels today relative to the rest of the competition in the fast-casual industry? Brian Niccol : Yes, look, I appreciate you taking notice. It's really important to us to make sure that we surround our employees with the right pay, the right growth opportunities and the right benefits. And I do think some of the things that we've added, like being able to help people or incentivize people to pay off student loans and then match them with a 401-K contribution, I think is a really good idea for the generation of people that we are hiring, the Gen Zs. And also the growth opportunity. Folks can join our company in crew and in three, four years, quickly find themselves leading one team and in some cases, being a multi-unit leader. So I just had the opportunity to meet a young lady. I think she was like 24 field leaders, newly promoted. She was at one of our cultivated university sessions and the young lady's very ambitious. I guarantee she'll be a TD the next time I see her. So I'm excited to have these growth opportunities for people surrounding them with great benefits and I think a great culture. How does that play out in stability? We're seeing some of the best stability we've seen, frankly, in my time at Chipotle. If you go back and look, the fact that we've got General Manager turnover in the low 20s, crew turnover kind of in the low 100s, that's really good. And relative to the industry, I think that's ahead of the industry, but I don't know those numbers for sure. But what I do know is we're getting more stability; we're seeing less turnover. And what we hear back from people is they love the purpose; they love the culture and they love the growth opportunity. And that's what we're going to continue to provide people. Operator : The next question comes from John Tower with Citigroup. John Tower : Great, thanks for taking the question. I'm just trying, you mentioned earlier, the idea that the suggestive selling is starting to work pretty well within the app in terms of getting some incremental attach for orders. But I'm curious if you're doing anything within the stores coaching people up to kind of work that as well, especially it looks like your digital sales mix, while not slowing remarkably is coming down quite a bit. So thinking about kind of the check growth from this point forward, are there means for you to be able to encourage greater attach for consumers in the store? Is there anything you're doing now? Brian Niccol : Look, I think in the restaurant, just the simple fact that I think our teams are doing a much better job of having chips and queso and guac all the way until close is making a big impact. I think we talked about this six, nine months ago. We weren't as good as we should have been call it after six, seven o 'clock at night with being ready to go with chips or guac and queso. And now we are. And our teams are very aware that they should be ready to go with those side items. And I think as a result, you're seeing more people attach them. We aren't doing anything out of the ordinary other than making sure we've got great product ready to go. And when people know it's there, they order it. And when our crew knows they have it, they're more willing to say, hey, do you need chips with this order? if it's seven o 'clock, eight o 'clock at night, and you don't have chips, you usually don't say to somebody, do you need chips with that? When you do, it comes pretty natural in the conversation to say, hey, do you need chips to go with that, or do you need a queso to go with that? So it's really been more focused on executing great culinary available from open to close. John Tower : Got it. And then just, further the delivery a little bit. It looks like that might be moving lower as a percentage of sales as well. And I'm just curious if from your perspective, you're getting any indication from those consumers that this is the way that they're better managing their own spend at the store, effectively trading that higher cost channel for a lower cost channel going directly to you. And actually, could you provide the delivery mix as well? Brian Niccol : Yes, look, I think intuitively, I think the answer is yes, right? If you're tighter on money, the most expensive way to experience Chipotle is through delivery. So I think consumers know that and they manage accordingly. But I will say that delivery channels have been pretty stable for the most part. It's in that 14%, 15% range for marketplace and then like 4% or 5% for white label. So you get like 20% delivery. But it's been pretty stable. And at the end of the day, though, if you need to manage your money, yes, delivery is the most expensive access point. Jack Hartung : The one thing, Brian, we have is Chipotlane. Chipotlane is one example where when you offer the convenience of Chipotlane and then the value that Chipotlane and the customization that Chipotle, you normally would expect to get. You do see that the delivery will drop like 10 points. So it'll drop to the low, call it 10%, 12% something like that, several to 10 points. And then our order ahead and pick up will move open at high 20s. So to us that's a clear indication that if we offer extreme convenience along with the value that you Chipotle have that people will choose that access channel as opposed to delivery. Operator : The next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thank you. Brian, just wanted to follow up on sort of the strength across income cohorts and the strength in the brand's value scores. Any other commentaries sort of on how you think that the strength in those value scores maybe is having, I don\u2019t know, an outsized impact perhaps on the customer, on traffic that you're seeing particularly in this environment where we're hearing about some softness in various parts of the consumer cohort? Any commentary on that based on data that you guys have related to those value scores? Brian Niccol : Yes, I mean look, I think it's the thing we've always talked about which is relative to, I would say, our peer food offerings, right? So other fast casual folks that have the same, or attempt to have the same quality food as us, now we're usually 20% to 30% less expensive. And then when you look at some of these other categories where, you traditionally view them as more value and convenience, the price delta that you have to pay in order to get our quality, our convenience, our customization, it's not that big of a leap up. So I think that's why we're positioned really well. If you want to move up, it's not a crazy leap up. And then when you look across, we're at a nice value relative to alternatives. So, I think that's why our value scores are as strong as they are. And we're very fortunate that we've been able to maintain that through the last couple of years. And, look, that's why we're maybe a little bit slower sometimes to take price. But when we took it, we thought it was because now the time was right, inflation wanted to doing it. But we've always wanted to do it from a standpoint of protecting our value proposition. And I think we've navigated that one pretty well, at least where we are right now. So we'll see what is in store for us. But I think we've talked about this all the time. Maintaining that value is a really important piece of the puzzle for us. And I just love the fact that we've got quality, we've got value, and we've got speed, and we've got customization. We'll protect all those things. And I think we're going to continue to do very well in regardless of what the environment is. Dennis Geiger : That's great. Thank you. And then just quick, Jack, anything more on mix on kind of looking ahead to \u201824, even at a high level, how to think about the mix component of the check and how that might trend? Thank you. Jack Hartung : Yes, hard to predict because we're in kind of an uncharted territory here, I would expect to see a similar kind of mix going forward that the pricing, I already talked about what the pricing will be. And I still think there's going to be continued adjustment to the group side for the next several quarters. I would expect it to just ratchet down. It's been ratcheting down over the last several quarters. So I'd expect it to ratchet down from the 150, but hard to predict. I don't know exactly what quarter will be at base and that we won't be seeing the group size decline at all. But it's down to, I think, a very manageable amount, this 150. I think the fact that it's combined with a 7.4% transaction growth and it's got very modest pricing, we think it's a really healthy balance right now. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company. Brian Bittner : Thanks. On Chipotlane, I mean, you have over 800 Chipotlane in your portfolio now. I think you built a record 238 of these in 2023. So the prototype is really starting to gain some scale here. And so now your learnings are so much deeper on these assets. So can you just update us on maybe the margin profile now of the Chipotlane portfolio, maybe versus the rest of the system? And are we at a point where there's enough Chipotlane and enough being built in the future where as they continue to increase as a percentage of the business that they can actually have an impact on the overall company's restaurant margin? Brian Niccol : Well, they're already having that impact. But to your point, it's relatively small because 800 is still, what is that maybe a quarter of our system. But it's hundreds of basis points of higher margin. If you compare it to our non-Chipotlane, the volumes have actually come pretty close. They're still a little bit higher for the Chipotlane versus non-Chipotlane, they close the gap a little bit. It was much, much higher during the pandemic. But when you combine volumes that are a little bit higher with margins that are hundreds of base points higher and the investment costs are virtually identical, it's a much higher return. So from a shareholder value standpoint, as we open up, as we grow from the 3, 400 towards 7, 000, the cash on cash returns we're getting from, the 80% or 85% of our new restaurants that have Chipotlane is much, much, much higher. So it does have an accretive impact on our margin. It has an even more meaningful accretive impact on our returns. And you'll just see it every time we open up new restaurants, you'll see that our margins are going to, they're going to continue to expand as long as our existing comp transactions grow and these new restaurants coming out board are just going to add fuel to the fire. Brian Bittner : Thanks for that. And just a follow-up on labor margins. In the fourth quarter, your labor margins ended up being much better than you had guided to originally. So I'm curious what positively surprised you on that line item. Was it just the higher sales and the flow through from that? And then as we look towards 1Q, you are guiding to some deleverage on the labor line year-over-year. Is that mostly just driven by the softer January or is labor leverage just going to be much more challenging this year as we move forward? Jack Hartung : Yes, no. Really the thing that happens when you turn the calendar, you have taxes because you have people that are hitting tax levels. So you kind of reset, this happens every year where our tax in Q4 is lower than they step up in Q1. So that's the only deleverage that you're saying. The leverage that we saw in the fourth quarter is a couple of things. One, when our volumes do, when our -- or comp accelerate, we do leverage that line as we saw leverage on that line. Two, the ops teams did a good job of managing labor. And then the third thing is our teams did a better job of managing through dealing with like sick time and vacation time at the end of the year. That was a little bit of a negative surprise to us the year before, and our team did a much better job this year of just getting ahead of that. So those are the three contributors, but you should expect that as we grow transactions next year, as long as wage inflation stays relatively benign, we should still continue to be able to delever the labor line. Operator : And the last questioner today will be Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, just under the wire. I guess I wanted to talk about how your most loyal customers are using Chipotle at this point, maybe if there's a way to contrast the frequency of those customers versus five years ago when rewards even, didn't exist or was very nascent. And then by the same token, we kind of talk about how new customers today are entering the Chipotle ecosystem and how they progress in frequency, maybe relative to what you would have seen pre-pandemic? Brian Niccol : Yes, well, the one thing that definitely is clear is if you're in the rewards program, you have higher frequency and higher check. And so obviously one of the things we're trying to do is both existing customers and new customers continue to drive engagement within our rewards program. And so that continues to work really well. I think we're now like 38 million or almost 40 million people in the program. So that is really powerful. And we didn't have that five, six, well, I guess seven years ago we didn't have that. And then when you think about pre-pandemic, one of the things that was kind of interesting is the pandemic kind of helped us move people into the digital system and get them going in the rewards program. So over and over again, what we see is whether you're a light, medium, or heavy user, when you're in the rewards program, you come more frequently and you spend more. And so it's a really powerful tool. And even when people are redeeming entrees, what we're seeing is they're still buying sites. They're still adding other items. So it's not just one of these things where when you accrue a free entree, you just show up and walk away with a free entree. So we're feeling really good about how the rewards program is working with all these different, I guess, frequency users. And then obviously as we continue to, I think, derive the Chipotle message, we're continuing to track new users. I don't know if you've seen the ads, Sharon, but I think some of the advertising we're running right now is the best we've done. And I think that's also helping to bring in new users. And then these new users are experiencing what I think is a great experience, great culinary, great throughput, great customization. So we've kind of got the system still early days. I think it could be better, but the system is working. And so we'll probably never be finished working against making everything better, but the system seems to be working right now. Sharon Zackfia : Can I ask a follow-up on LTOs? Do those overarch towards kind of improving existing customer frequency, or are they a real driver of new customers coming into Chipotle? Brian Niccol : They've actually been a really good driver of new customers. So and that's one of the things we look for when we do our testing is how well are they at bringing in new customers? And they've been a really nice tool to bring in new customers. And unfortunately, even when we have the LTO walk away, people are really hooked on the experience, that being culinary, right, that quality, the convenience, the speed, the customization. So it's been a really good tool. Operator : This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing comments. Brian Niccol : All right, thank you. And thanks everybody for joining the call and the questions. I do want to start off with, again, thanking, our 115, 000 team members. We had an outstanding 2023. And without a doubt, it was because we led with, I think, much better performance in the restaurants. And this is a real testament to our employees, staying focused, getting after the basics and working towards hitting our standards. So we had some really big milestones, right? We surpassed 3, 400 restaurants. We opened 800 Chipotlanes. We got past 3 million in average unit volumes. And now we're really excited about where we go next on this journey, which is we'll be even better at throughput. We'll be even faster. We'll be even better on the culinary. And I think that's going to result in us achieving these 4 million average unit volumes in our 7, 000 restaurants in the future. So again, a big thank you to our team. And, obviously we're excited about what's next. So we'll talk to you all here in the next couple of months. Thanks. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Olsen, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead. Cynthia Olsen : Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.

We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian Niccol : Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. The momentum in the business continued in the first quarter as we delivered 7% comp sales growth driven by over 5% transaction growth. Our strong sales trends were fueled by our focus on improving throughput in our restaurants as well as successful marketing campaigns, including spotlighting barbacoa and the return of Chicken al Pastor as a limited-time offer. For the quarter, sales grew 14% to reach $2.7 billion driven by a 7% comp. In-store sales grew by 19% over last year as throughput reached the highest levels in 4 years. Digital sales represented 37% of sales. Restaurant-level margin was 27.5%, an increase of 190 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $13.37, representing 27% growth over last year. And we opened 47 new restaurants, including 43 Chipotlanes. The strength in our business has continued into April. And as a result, we are increasing our annual comp guidance and now estimate comps in the mid- to high single-digit range for the full year. Now let me shift to an update on our 5 key strategies that help us to win today while we grow our future. These strategies include sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level; running successful restaurants with a people-accountable culture that provides great Food with Integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences; making the brand visible, relevant and loved to improve overall guest engagement; amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity in our restaurants, support centers and in our supply chain; and finally, expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings in North America and internationally. I'll begin with our world-class people leadership. Last month, we held our All Manager Conference, where we brought together 4,500 of our restaurant and support center leaders to celebrate their success as well as amplify our focus on exceptional people, exceptional food and exceptional throughput. The conference included over 3,200 general managers, 100 apprentices, 450 field leaders, 60 team directors and 11 regional vice presidents. For the first time, we also included crew members who have worked with us for over 20 years to celebrate their commitment and dedication to Chipotle. In fact, one of our general managers in attendance from Denver, Colorado has been with Chipotle for 23 years, and she also had 4 crew members from her restaurant, who have each been with the company for over 20 years. Collectively, that is over 100 years of Chipotle experience, call it, one restaurant, which is just incredible. And it is no surprise this restaurant has fantastic operations with throughput that is outperforming the overall company. At our conference, we highlighted the growth opportunity at Chipotle. To reach our long-term target over 7,000 restaurants in North America, we showed our teams that we will need to double the number of field leadership positions we have. And as we target over 90% internal promotions, the majority of these future leaders will come from the GMs and apprentices at this conference. This was a powerful and motivating message and one that is unique to Chipotle given our scale, growth and company-owned model.  And in connection with our 50 :1 stock split, we also announced that all of our GMs as well as crew members who have been with Chipotle over 20 years will receive stock grants once the split is effective. This will allow them to participate in the financial success of the company. Bottom line, Chipotle is changing lives for the better. In fact, one of our restaurateurs and certified training managers spoke at the conference and shared that her experience at Chipotle helped her to overcome financial hardship. Now she was even on the verge of homelessness before she joined Chipotle. She started as a crew member over 10 years ago and has thrived, making her way to the highest-level GM and is now well on her way to becoming a field leader. She was able to leverage our education benefits to earn a college degree, the first in her family. And utilizing the stock she received as a restaurateur, she was able to purchase her first home. She is also one of our team members in our Behind the Foil commercials as she really is a great example of exceptional people that makes Chipotle, Chipotle. In addition to our world-class people, exceptional food and exceptional throughput are key areas of focus and are both critical to running our successful restaurants. We spent time at our All Manager Conference reminding our teams about Chipotle's culture of Food with Integrity and how there's a direct connection between how food is raised and prepared and how it tastes. We showcased Chipotle's Food with Integrity journey and our strong partnerships with our farmers and suppliers, who take special care in ensuring they are growing our food with the highest standards. We also emphasized the importance of teaching and tasting Chipotle, which means that our restaurant teams taste the food they prepare multiple times a day to assure it is delicious and meets our high standards. You see, Chipotle was founded on this idea of real food and real culinary. It's not a marketing slogan or a short-term initiative. It's in our heritage. It's in our DNA. Our restaurant teams take pride our food, and our healthy, high-quality eating experience adds value for our guests. In addition to our delicious food, exceptional throughput or the speed of service in our restaurant also adds to the extraordinary value proposition we offer. I'm thrilled to share that the momentum and throughput continued to build in the first quarter as we improved by nearly 2 entrees in our peak 15 minutes compared to last year with each month showing an acceleration. At our All Manager Conference, we also focused on coaching the nuances of great throughput or executing what we call the 4 pillars. This includes expo or the crew member between sauce and cash to help expedite the bagging and payment process; linebacker, typically the manager on duty who supplies both lines with freshly prepared food so that the crew on our line can continue to serve our guests without interruption; mise en place or another way of saying that everything that is needed for a lunch or dinner peak is ready and in its place; and aces in their places or having the best trained crew deployed in each position for lunch and dinner peaks. We are in the early innings of consistently executing the 4 pillars, but when we do, it creates a flywheel effect in our restaurants. The restaurants run more smoothly as our teams are properly trained and deployed, which allows them to keep up with demand without stress. This leads to more stability, and therefore, more experienced teams that execute better every day. And this can be seen in our latest turnover data, which is at historically low levels. And for our guests, faster throughput results in shorter, faster-moving lines and hotter, fresher food, strengthening our value proposition and driving incremental transactions. Our restaurant in the Financial District in Boston is a great example where a year ago, they were doing mid-20 entrees in their peak 15 minutes. And today, they are doing over 40 entrees in their peak 15 minutes with days that can reach as high as 80, which is among the highest in the company. The restaurant has low turnover and outsized transaction growth, which clearly demonstrates they are creating a better overall experience in the restaurant. Now turning to marketing. Our marketing team has started the year off strong with outstanding brand advertising and menu innovation. We have continued our successful Behind the Foil brand campaign, showing our real teams prepping our delicious fresh food by hand every day, reinforcing a key differentiator for Chipotle. This ran across all media channels, including high-profile placements in television such as college football and the NFL Playoffs. We also began to promote our delicious barbacoa as we leveraged our consumer insights that told us that many of our guests did not know that barbacoa was braised beef. So we renamed it Braised Beef Barbacoa and emphasized the culinary recipe, which is slow-cooked, responsibly raised beef seasoned with garlic and cumin and hand-shredded. It was Chipotle's best-kept secret and is now growing in popularity. The campaign was a success, driving incremental transactions and spend, and it was simple for our operations team to execute since it was an existing menu item. This is a perfect example of how our marketing team continues to make Chipotle more visible, more relevant and more loved. During the quarter, we also brought back one of our most requested new menu items, Chicken al Pastor. Our guests loved our spin on the al Pastor using our adobo chicken, Morita peppers with a splash of pineapple, fresh lime and hand-chopped cilantro. Similar to carne asada, when we bring back a past favorite, we are able to improve the entire experience as we leverage our know-how across culinary, supply chain, marketing and operations to make it more delicious with seamless execution. Chicken al Pastor is off to a great start once again, driving incremental transactions into our restaurants. Moving on to technology and innovation. Our marketing and digital teams continue to grow and evolve our Rewards program, which recently celebrated its fifth anniversary. It is exciting that we now have a digital reach of about 40 million Rewards members that we can leverage to increase engagement. Through our marketing initiatives, we continue to find successful ways to drive enrollments, and we are leveraging our digital team to create a seamless app experience and deliver more relevant journeys for our Rewards members. The goal is to drive higher engagement in the program, which results in higher frequency and spend over time. In our restaurants, we continue to explore technology tools that can drive higher productivity and improve the overall experience for our teams. This includes things like forecasting and deploying labor, recruiting new crew members, preparing our fresh food and automating the preparation of digital orders. In fact, at our All Manager Conference, we showed our teams the latest version of our automated digital makeline and Autocado, which cuts cores and peels avocados. And as we discussed last quarter, we are excited to get both into a restaurant later this year as part of the stage gate process. Our final strategic priority is expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings in North America and internationally. We remain on track to open 285 to 315 new restaurants this year, mostly in North America. We continue to see strength in openings across geographies and location types, including urban, suburban and small towns. Additionally, our development team is making progress to smooth the cadence of openings throughout the year with the number of restaurants under construction up meaningfully to last year. Outside of North America, I'm delighted to share that we opened our first restaurant in Kuwait with the Alshaya Group, which marks the first time we've entered a new country in over 10 years. This was a highly collaborative effort between the Alshaya Group and our Chipotle teams across culinary, food safety, development operations and supply chain to successfully launch Chipotle in a brand-new market with the same food quality standards and customer experience that we have in North America. Although it is very early, the opening was strong, and we look forward to continued success in many restaurants across the region with the Alshaya Group. Moving to Europe. As you may recall, we brought over one of our top operators about a year ago, who helped to identify areas of opportunity, including better aligning our training tools, systems and culinary with our North American operations where it makes sense and is feasible. We have made nice progress aligning the culinary and are beginning to better align the operations, including a recent change in leadership structure as we expand the role of our Canadian leader to oversee both Canada and Europe. Over the last 5 years, Canada's economics have improved to be on par with the U.S. In fact, Canada is leading our company in many key operational KPIs, including throughput. The successful approach of aligning the local strategy with our overall operational vision and diligently overseeing execution of Chipotle standards has set up Canada for rapid expansion. We see many similarities between the European operation today and the Canadian operation 5 years ago. The new leadership team in Europe, including 2 top operators from the U.S., will take a similar strategic approach to improve economics and unlock Europe's growth potential.  In closing, the strength in our business, including transaction-driven comps, is due to the collective hard work of our 120,000 employees, who are results-driven, passionate about our purpose of cultivating a better world and excited for our growth opportunities ahead. At our All Manager Conference, I highlighted the importance of people development as it represents one of our greatest strengths. Seeing our leaders all in one place was inspiring, and their personal growth stories are real and a key ingredient to Chipotle's success and future growth. This makes me more confident than ever that we have the right people and the right strategy to achieve our long-term goals of more than doubling our restaurants in North America and expanding internationally. As I've said in the past, I believe the next Chipotle is Chipotle. And with that, I will turn it over to Jack. John Hartung : Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the first quarter grew 14.1% year-over-year to reach $2.7 billion as sales comp grew 7% driven by over 5% transaction growth. Restaurant-level margin of 27.5% increased about 190 basis points compared to last year. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $13.37, representing 27% year-over-year growth. The first quarter had unusual expenses related to an increase in legal reserves. As Brian mentioned, based on our strong underlying transaction trends, we are raising our full year comp guidance to the mid- to high single-digit range. We anticipate second quarter comps to be the highest of the year, which includes a benefit of an extra day from the Easter shift, and we anticipate comps to continue to be driven by transactions in the back half of the year. We do have some challenging rollover components, including Chicken al Pastor ending, lapping our menu price increase from the prior year and rolling over the very successful carne asada campaign. With that said, we have a strong plan in place for the back half both in terms of operations and marketing. Additionally, in April, minimum wage in California for restaurant companies like ours increased to $20 an hour. As a result, our wages in California went up by nearly 20%, and we subsequently took a 6% to 7% menu price increase in our California restaurants just to cover the cost in dollar terms. This will add almost 1 full point to total company pricing beginning in Q2. California restaurant cash flow is below the company average, so this increase will allow us to maintain cash flow. However, it will have a negative impact to overall company restaurant-level margin by about 20 basis points. I'll now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 28.8%, an increase of about 40 basis points from last year. The benefit of last year's menu price increase was partially offset by inflation across several ingredient costs, primarily beef and produce, and a protein mix headwind and from the successful beef barbacoa marketing initiative. For Q2, we expect our cost of sales to be in the mid-29% range due to higher prices across several items, but most notably avocados as we anticipate a step-up from the low levels we have seen over the past several quarters. We anticipate cost of sales inflation will be in the mid-single-digit range for the remainder of this year. Labor costs for the quarter were 24.4%, a decrease of about 20 basis points from last year as the benefit from sales leverage more than offset wage inflation and the higher performance-based compensation. For Q2, we expect our labor costs to stay in the mid-24% range with wage inflation stepping up to about 6% as a result of the minimum wage increase in California. Other operating costs for the quarter were 14.3%, a decrease of about 100 basis points from last year. The decrease was driven by sales leverage, lower delivery expenses and lower marketing and promo costs. Marketing and promo costs were 2.9% of sales in Q1, a decrease of about 30 basis points from last year. In Q2, we expect marketing costs to be in the low 2% range with the full year to come in just below 3%. In Q2, other operating costs are expected to be in the low 13% range. G&A for the quarter was $204 million on a GAAP basis or $191 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding a $13 million increase in legal reserves. G&A also includes $126 million in underlying G&A, $34 million related to noncash stock comp, $21 million related to our successful All Manager Conference we held in March and $10 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vestings and exercises. We expect our underlying G&A to be around $129 million in Q2 and step up each quarter as we make investments in people and technology to support ongoing growth. We anticipate stock comp will be around $36 million in Q2, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance. We also expect to recognize around $6 million related to higher bonus accruals and employer taxes associated with shares that vest during the quarter, bringing our total anticipated G&A in Q2 to around $171 million. Depreciation for the quarter was $83 million or 3.1% of sales, and we expect depreciation to step up slightly each quarter as we continue to open more restaurants. Our effective tax rate for Q1 was 22% for GAAP and 22.1% for non-GAAP. And our effective tax rate benefited from option exercises and equity vesting above grant values. For fiscal 2024, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items. On March 19, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a 50-for-1 stock split, one of the largest in New York Stock Exchange history. We believe this will make our stock more accessible to our employees as well as a broader range of investors. Pending shareholder approval in early June to increase the number of authorized shares, the stock will begin trading on a post-split basis at the market open on Wednesday, June 26. Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with $2.2 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt. As a result of the timing of our announcement of the stock split, we were unable to repurchase shares for most of the quarter, which limited our share repurchases to just $25 million at an average price of $2,320. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $400 million remaining under our share authorization program, and we will be able to resume opportunistically repurchasing our shares when the window opens -- reopens in a few days. We opened 47 new restaurants in the first quarter, of which 43 had a Chipotlane. And we continue to anticipate opening between 285 and 315 new restaurants in 2024 with over 80% having a Chipotlane. And we remain on track to move toward the high end of the 8% to 10% range by 2025, assuming time line conditions do not worsen. To close, I want to reiterate the message I shared at our recent All Manager Conference. Chipotle started over 30 years ago with a young chef who thought just because food is served fast doesn't mean it has to be a typical fast food experience. That evolved into our Food with Integrity journey, defying the traditional fast food model by investing more in our ingredients and shaping our economic model to help fund that investment. And today, we have a special brand and unique economic model that allows us to spend more on our ingredients yet remain one of the most affordable meals in the industry while also maintaining industry-leading margins. These 3 characteristics are incredibly difficult to replicate : premium ingredients, affordable prices and attractive margins. And this is a huge competitive advantage. And as we continue to protect and strengthen our economic model, the future looks very bright for Chipotle. And with that, we're happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from David Tarantino with Baird. David Tarantino : My question is on speed of service. And Brian, I think you mentioned that you improved in Q1 by 2 transactions, which I think is the biggest improvement we've seen in quite some time. So I guess the first question is, could you maybe elaborate on the factors that drove such a sharp improvement? And then secondly, could you maybe give us an update on where you think you are exiting the quarter, entering the first -- or the second quarter versus where you ultimately want to be? How much progress, I guess, relative to the ultimate goal that you make in the last 3.5 months? Brian Niccol : Yes. So thanks, David. Well, first, I got to give a big kind of applause to our operators. We've really done a great job, I think, of staffing, scheduling and deploying and then really executing against our 4 pillars of great throughput. So the nice thing that happened is we saw, frankly, a step-up almost every month. And we continue to see progress as are now in the month of April. In fact, if you remember this, David, we were talking probably in 2023 about being in the low 20s and we want to get into the mid-20s. The good news is we're finally closing in on those mid-20s. And we're starting to see certain days push high 20s. So still lots of room for improvement. But I really must say that I think the focus, the staffing, the deployment, the scheduling and then also giving our operators the visibility with reporting has really, I think, driven terrific outcomes on this throughput effort. And we're really excited about where we can go from here. David Tarantino : And just maybe a quick follow-up on that. So the last year you made this type of progress on throughput that I can remember was all the way back in 2014, and it was a very big comp driver that year. And I just wonder, could this become a big comp driver as you look at the rest of this year and into the next few years? I mean is it possible that this is a big driver as we think about how the next several years plays out? Or is this more of a we're starting to get closer to where you want to be, and maybe it plays out this year, and you normalize versus that base? Brian Niccol : Yes. No, you're exactly right, David. So 2014 was kind of our high-water mark on throughput. And we believe we've got years of opportunity in this. Just from what we're seeing, we still have a lot of opportunity to execute against the 4 pillars to great throughput. So our teams are doing a much better job than we were just last month or even 6 months ago. But there's still so much upside in what our teams can do and perform. So this is a multiyear -- you're going to hear us talking about throughput for a long time. And I think you're going to be hearing us talk about how we're getting better as time goes by, assuming we're able to keep the staffing, assuming we're able to keep the deployment, assuming we're able to keep the teams focused on this. But rest assured, it is one of our key drivers of our strategy going forward. And our operators know it's critical. And the good news is when they have success with throughput, a lot of good things happen for the team. Customer satisfaction scores go up. Bonuses go up. All kinds of good things are happening in the restaurant. The food is better. The experience is better. It's just -- it's one of those things that cascades into everything being a lot better. David Tarantino : Great. Congrats on a great start to the year. Brian Niccol : Yes. Thanks, David. Operator : The next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank. Lauren Silberman : So on traffic, incredible numbers. You talked about this trend continuing into April and particularly impressive when considering what we're seeing in the overall industry. Can you give more color on just the cadence of trends you saw throughout the quarter and into April and color on what you're seeing with the consumer performance at the high-income versus low-income consumer? Operator : My apologies, it looks like we've lost connection with our speakers. Please hold while we reconnect.  [Technical Difficulty] Thank you very much for your patience. We have reconnected with our speakers. We currently have Lauren Silberman from Deutsche Bank asking a question. Lauren Silberman : So if I could just ask about just traffic. Incredible trends during the quarter, strength continuing into April, particularly impressive when considering what's going on in the overall industry. Can you give some more color on the cadence of trends you saw throughout the quarter and into April? And then talk about what you're seeing with the consumer, high-income versus low-income performance. Brian Niccol : Yes. Sure. So this is Brian. I'll get started, and Jack, feel free to chime in. The good news is, obviously, we had some weather in January, and then we had the timing of the Easter holiday in March and April. But consistently, what we saw was a step-up from that bad weather. And then really our transactions have been running kind of in this mid-single-digit range, which has been, I think, a real testament to the work that's been going on both in the restaurant around throughput and then obviously some of the marketing work that we've got going on both with barbacoa and Chicken al Pastor. So we continue to see that strength as we entered April. And when we look at where that strength is coming from because I think your question is about consumer/income cohorts, it's really broad based. So from the low-income consumer to the middle-income to the higher-income consumer, we're just seeing gains with all income cohorts. And when we ask the question, why is that, what we hear back from every group is it's a great value proposition. So the speed at which people can get these quality ingredients, customize the way they want for the price points that we provided is playing back -- is just -- create value in this environment. John Hartung : And then, Brian, the only thing to add was transactions were up almost 5.5% during the quarter, and that was offset by check increase by about 1.5%. That was driven by part check and then offset by a little mix -- a little negative mix mostly due to group size. Lauren Silberman : Very helpful. If I could just have a quick one on throughput. Do we expect the throughput efforts to compound over time as consumers recognize the improved operations? Is that what's happening as we move through the quarters? Brian Niccol : Yes. Yes, that's exactly right. I think we've talked about this in the past. When you know the line moves quickly, you're willing to get in line. And also what happens is the experience is just all that much better, right? The culinary moves faster, and then you get to your experience faster. So our teams run more efficiently. The food, I think, comes across even better prepared. And then you as a customer move through the line faster. So it is one of those things where kind of speed begets speed is the way to describe it. John Hartung : Yes. And Brian, I was just going to ask -- add the -- in terms of the in-store channel, it's the fastest-growing channel during the quarter, and that's coming from 2 areas. One, we've got our in-store customers. Those customers that tend to come in store are coming more often. And it makes sense that when the lines are moving, they're going to come more often. And we're actually also seeing a little bit of shift from some of the order-ahead. Those folks are shifting into the order -- into the in-store channel as well. Again, when the lines are moving well, when the restaurant is running well, people like to come in and select their meal along the front line. Lauren Silberman : Great. Congrats on the quarter. Brian Niccol : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Charles with TD Cowen. Andrew Charles : I wanted to ask though on transactions. Jack, hoping you can talk about apples-to-apples, the impact on traffic this has had. So if you go back to July 2022, when you guys introduced Project Square One, you talked about hundreds of basis points of transactions that are on the table from reclaiming peak same-store sales or peak transactions. So here we are, you're back to pre-COVID levels. Is there way you can help contextualize the last 1.5 years or so since July 2022 what you've seen from transaction growth, same-store transactions from Project Square One? John Hartung : Yes. Andrew, it's -- so it's hard to parse out the transactions and say how much is due to things like Chicken al Pastor, how much is due to things like barbacoa. Barbacoa, we think, drove some transactions as well and then throughput -- how much is driven by throughput specifically.  I think part of what's happening is they complement each other. And so when we're moving into our peak season right now, and these are our peak sales season, and we've got Chicken al Pastor, which has been -- it's off to a great start, and so you've got seasonally more people coming into the restaurant and more people want to come in and enjoy Chicken al Pastor. If you don't have throughput, the in-store channel is not going to be the fastest-growing channel or at least it's not going to grow as fast. So is throughput driving the transactions or is it enabling the transaction? So it's hard to sort through whether it's the driver or the enabler. But it really doesn't matter to us because when we've got great LTOs with great advertising and that we're executing great throughput, we know the transactions will flow. And similar to David Tarantino's comment from 2014, that's exactly what was happening, is throughput is an enabler or a driver of transaction growth for not just many quarters but many years. Andrew Charles : Got it. And then separately, Brian, a philosophical question for you. Just given the strength of the business you're seeing in recent years, which I think is really exemplified in the first quarter given the challenging industry backdrop, just curious how your philosophy on the second concept has perhaps changed. You no doubt have a full plate of exciting opportunities for the brand in the years ahead. But just given the success and the recipe for success that you've seen that you've implemented, does it lead you to believe that you could benefit from a second concept? Brian Niccol : Obviously, this comes up every once in a while, people bring it up. And the thing I would say is, right now, we're much more focused on just turning Chipotle into an iconic brand that I think it can be not just in the U.S. but outside the U.S. Obviously, if the opportunity presents itself, where it would make sense for us to do something outside of the brand, I never want to say never, but it's just not a focus area for us right now.  We've got so much opportunity in front of us just with what we can do with the brand Chipotle that internally, we're not working on it. But you never know. The external environment changes, and we'd be foolish to say we wouldn't be opportunistic. And luckily, we're operating from a position of strength right now. So I want to be as opportunistic as possible on brand Chipotle. And then if the external environment were to change and present other opportunities, maybe we would consider it, but it's not part of our growth strategy right now. Operator : The next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Sara Senatore : Just a quick housekeeping and then another question, please. So just I think, Jack, you mentioned slightly negative mix. Can you clarify what's pricing this quarter? I think it was just under 3%, like 2.8%, something like that. And then what does that mean for Q2 now that you've taken the price increase in California? So that's just the sort of modeling question. John Hartung : Yes. Sara, you're right. Pricing in the quarter was like 2.7%, 2.8%. The only change going into next quarter and the next couple of quarters is we've got the California pricing. That's somewhere around 100 basis points or a little bit less. So Q2 and Q3 will be somewhere in that 3.5% range, and then Q4 will fall off and be more in that 1.5% range because we'll compare against last year's pricing. Sara Senatore : Great. Very helpful. And then I wanted to ask about sort of the store mix, which is you're seeing a shift towards in-store. Does that have any -- I know you said group size is still falling a little bit, presumably from the lower delivery. But do you see any impact from shifting to in-store? I'm thinking more possibly positive from better attach for like beverages, for example. And I'm curious if -- as you look out ahead, if mix could possibly turn positive from a driver like that. John Hartung : Yes. It's a good question, Sara. We're actually seeing within the, call it, 1.5% of negative -- or it's a 1.5% positive with a mix impact of, call it, about 100 basis points or so. What's happening is the group size is more like declining by about 2%. We actually do have side -- additional side attachment. But we're seeing the side attachment grow in both digital and in in-restaurant, and we are seeing the side attachment increase faster in restaurants than the side. So there is a positive factor there.  It's less from drinks though. It's more with extra meats. It's chips. It's queso. So we're getting a better attachment in both channels, and it is getting better even in the in-store channel. Part of that, we think, frankly, is when we have the line fully staffed, we do think we do a better job of not only making the burrito but making sure when the burrito or the bowl is presented to our cashier that these extras and these sides are more properly run up. Drinks have been relatively steady. We're not seeing a big shift in drinks. Sara Senatore : Okay. Got it. So kind of the opposite of the check management that we're seeing elsewhere? John Hartung : Correct. Operator : The next question comes from Jon Tower with Citigroup. Jon Tower : Just a couple. First, maybe as we think about that path to $4 million AUVs that you've spoken about before, can you help us just maybe think about even your average customer frequency today and how that compares to the rest of maybe some of your competitive set out there for just your average customer? Brian Niccol : Yes. I don't know how to think about our frequency relative to some competitive opportunities out there. What I can tell you is the folks that are in our Rewards program, we see -- with their high engagement, we see higher spend and more frequency. And then also what we're seeing in the business, which I think is really nice to see as a result, I think the efforts both in better operational execution and I think our advertising around just the base business, this idea of real ingredients, real culinary, fast customization. We're just seeing the base business grow. So obviously, we love what Chicken al Pastor does for us as far as menu variety. Obviously, we love the fact that we're able to rehit barbacoa, which is within our existing business. But I think what's been nice about the cadence of marketing and news combined with, I think, great operational execution is we're just seeing the base business grow. So we're getting more new users. We're getting existing users to come more often. And it's a great recipe to grow your core business in all the various ways we've talked about, right, from marketing to digital to operations. Jon Tower : Great. Maybe just pivoting a little bit on you. Can you talk about the Canadian market and specifically about the potential you think for that over the long term? And then expanding, I think you had mentioned earlier the idea that Europe looks a lot like Canada 5 years ago. But do you feel like you can, given everything you've learned in Canada, implement a lot of what you've taken there and apply it to Europe such that the time line around getting growth in Europe will be a lot faster versus what you saw in Canada? Brian Niccol : Look, I mean, we're delighted with what's happened or what's occurred in Canada 5, 6 years ago. We were struggling to make the unit economics look very compelling. Now they're very compelling. It's right there with the U.S. And as a result, that business is closing in on 50 restaurants. And pretty soon, we'll have 100 restaurants up there. And then I think we'll be talking about having hundreds of restaurants in Canada, which is really exciting.  To answer your question on Europe, yes, look, I think our belief is we've learned a lot on what we've had to do in Canada to get that business to perform. We're taking that leadership there, giving her the opportunity to oversee our Europe business, take those lessons learned and apply it. And then at the same token, we're taking what we think are some of our best operators in the U.S., giving them the opportunity to grow by working in our European business.  So the time line, I don't know what the time line is going to be, but I am feeling optimistic that we've got the right operators, the right leadership. And then look, the proposition is compelling, right? Clean food, great culinary, done fast with high levels of customization that resonates. So I'm optimistic about where we go from here for all the reasons I just mentioned. Operator : The next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Dennis Geiger : Brian, I wanted to follow up on your comment there that the incremental traffic or visits are coming both from existing customers coming more as well as from new customers. I don't know if you have this granular level of detail, but I'm curious if you have a sense maybe from where. Maybe it's everywhere, but if it's QSR, if it's other fast casual. Any sense -- are you picking it up more at lunch, the incremental visits and customers more at dinner? Is there any other level of granularity to kind of help explain some of the success and maybe where it's coming from as it shifts to you folks? Brian Niccol : No, not really. I mean the good news for us is it's pretty broad based, right? It's coming across all income cohorts. It's coming across lunch and dinner and the afternoon. So it's not like there's one thing that I would identify as like this change in consumer behavior. I think the one big change for us is we're performing a lot better in giving people the experience that they actually want from Chipotle. I think you've heard us talk about this time and time again, exceptional food, exceptional people, exceptional throughput. And I think we're just getting better at each of those things. And the good news for us is we have an opportunity to be even better than we are today.  And then you layer in what I talked about earlier as it relates to marketing, both talking about the brand itself and then some of this menu news. It's just -- it's one of those things that builds on itself, right? Great digital programs, great marketing programs become much more effective when we're executing operations at a higher level. And I think that's what's happening. Dennis Geiger : That's great. And then just one -- just on the menu innovation follow-up. Just given the success you've seen as you bring back past favorites, as it relates to the go-forward, given the success that you've seen in recent years from that strategy, has that shifted at all how you think about menu innovation going forward as it relates to bringing back past favorites versus some newer items? Any shift there for you and for the team? Brian Niccol : No, no real shift. I mean I think we like this cadence of 1 or 2 items a year. The good news is we've got now a great proven group of menu news that we can provide. And the good news is we've got a really talented culinary team and a talented marketing team that continues to help us find, I think, new flavors that make sense that can be executed correctly at Chipotle.  So you're going to see us continue to hopefully mix in things that we know have worked in the past and things that will be new but have gone through our stage-gate process so that we have a high level of success or belief in success going forward. So we like the cadence we're in. We can operate really well with it, and it seems to be resonating with our customers. So we want to keep doing what's working. Dennis Geiger : Congratulations. Brian Niccol : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : I wanted to get an update on some of the near-term operational initiatives that you've talked about before, the clamshell, Autocado, Hyphen, and just kind of where we are in the stage-gate process. And if you can put that in the context of kind of an updated, I guess, funding of the Cultivate fund, what types of opportunities that you're looking for, for the next phase of opportunities to overall accelerate the Chipotle brand. Brian Niccol : Yes. Sure. So obviously, all this stuff is really exciting. The dual-sided grill, we've expanded to a few more restaurants, specifically our high-volume restaurants. We think that's not only a great unlock for consistency in the culinary of our proteins and meats, but it's also a nice unlock for high-volume restaurants because you can cook the chicken faster. It allows the teams then to start prep closer to when we want to serve customers, which is really exciting. So we're continuing to test and learn on that front. We've also made some nice progress on the energy usage associated with it, which was something that was a bit of a barrier. On Hyphen and Autocado, I'm happy to say we've got both of those units back in our Cultivate Center for a couple of prototypes in. And we are feeling really good about getting those into a restaurant probably in the back half of this year.  And then there's a lot of other things happening, too, both on like forecasting, deployment, tools to help our team members cut veggies more efficiently, more effectively. So there's a lot of good things happening behind the scenes. And I'm optimistic about what some of these things can do for our team members to give them a better experience, which then I know translates into better culinary and then ultimately better experiences for our customers. On the Cultivate Next fund, this continues to be a real, I think, highlight area for us because we're continuing to see great ideas. And these great ideas are all the way from different ways to fertilize, to weeding in the fields, to different ways to actually deliver food or oils. So the thing I know about this is it's perfectly in sync with our purpose of cultivating a better world. And we can use it to really move forward the entire system necessary to give people great culinary, great ingredients, great food, at affordable prices. So you're seeing us invest up and down the supply chain all the way to the point of customer experience. Operator : The next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : I guess on California, where you took the price increase, I know it's pretty recent. But could you give us an idea of where average ticket now sits in California and whether you've been seeing any resistance within that market as wages have ticked up and you've had to take that price increase? John Hartung : Yes, Sharon. So the average ticket in California is similar to the rest of the country. Until this increase, our menu prices in California were very similar to the averages throughout the country, even though the cost of doing business out in California tends to be higher. After the increase, we still have burritos that are going to be reasonably priced. The chicken burrito is going to be around $10. It's very early, as you mentioned. It's too early to tell. We're not seeing any kind of change in consumer behavior yet, but it's only been a matter of a few weeks so far. So we'll keep a close eye on it.  We still think in California compared to competitors, we're still a terrific value if you look at what others are charging because if you look at others in California before this increase and compare them to average measure prices throughout the country, they tend to be higher. They're passing on a higher cost of doing business. We've tried to keep our pricing very, very affordable in California. So we still think we offer a great value here. So we think we'll fare quite well. As a consumer absorbs and figures out how do they want to balance their budget, we think Chipotle will stay in the budget. Sharon Zackfia : Okay. Great. I wanted to ask another question, too, as it relates to Chipotlanes, which obviously have been great. But as you look at kind of the automation and the initiatives you're working on, do you think there's anything that you're looking at or that could come down the pike that would open up kind of the opportunity for a nondigital drive-through, just a regular drive-up and order drive-through? Or is there not something from a robotic assembly standpoint that could answer that for you? Brian Niccol : Yes. We don't envision that occurring. The thing that makes Chipotle pretty special is all the customization, and we would hate to screw up that experience. And that's why -- you might remember this. I remember when we first did this. Everybody was like, oh, people are going to be confused, how are they going to know how to order, so on and so forth. And it's turned out to be a really pleasant experience for both our team members and our customers because literally all they have to do is pick up their food. Everything is paid for. The order is accurate. It's on time and on you go. So we think there's other places for us to be more productive, where we're hunting on kind of using robotics and AI and finding other ways to do productivity. But you're not going to see that coming down the pike. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Brian Harbour : I had a question just on your comments about the Rewards program. Obviously, you continue to add people to that. But the effort to kind of drive engagement on a same-user basis, I know you've worked on personalization of offers and such. Have you seen that kind of showing? Have you seen pretty nice improvements in frequency? Or anything you can say just about what you've observed kind of from the same-user base of Rewards members? Brian Niccol : Yes. I think one of the things that's pretty interesting that over the last, I'd say, couple of months has really worked well for us is kind of between machine learning and AI. I'm not sure what the right label is here. But we figured out how to identify somebody that might go less frequent so that we can keep them in the mix. And that's proving to be pretty powerful. Still a very small cohort that we're learning on. But the good news is we're seeing nice progress with that cohort that I'm optimistic kind of in our stage-gate process, we'll take that learning and figure out how to apply it on a much bigger scale so that then you can feel it across the digital business.  But it's those types of things where I think the team is doing a nice job of commercializing the data in a very effective way that ultimately for the customer, it feels like more personalization, more relevance. Therefore, you keep the engagement up. And then obviously, when we keep the engagement up, we see the higher spend and the more frequency. Brian Harbour : Okay. Got it. There is a comment you made, Brian, just about forecasting and deployment in restaurants. So it's not just equipment. It's also kind of that piece of it, which I assume you're referring to kind of the software tools that you've put there. Is that -- what have you seen from that so far? Has that made a big difference, in your opinion, on throughput and kind of staffing? Could you say more about that? Brian Niccol : Yes, definitely. Look, I think one of the things that's happening is because we're getting better at forecasting, better at deploying, better at the scheduling, the job is becoming a better job, right? And one of the ways you see it is in our turnover numbers, right? Our turnover numbers are the lowest they've ever been. We've got some regions well below 100% turnover at the crew level, which I've never seen in my time in this industry. I think some of the lowest numbers I've ever seen, frankly, at Chipotle. And to be in that 100% range, I think, is a testament to us making the job a better experience for our team members. I say this all the time to our folks. I said this at our AMC. Our folks show up at work wanting to succeed. The more we can do to surround them so that they have a successful day, the better they feel about the job, the better they feel about the experience that they're giving. Nobody likes to show up and be out of chicken when a customer gets to that point. And so the more we can do to ensure they prep correctly, they're staffed correctly, they're deployed correctly, the better the experience is going to be. And I think we're starting to see that in the turnover numbers. We're starting to see that in, frankly, just the performance at throughput, right, the ultimate kind of metric to see like is the whole system really working. The whole system is working when we get great throughput. And I'm just -- I'm delighted to see it happen. I talked about this a little bit in my prepared remarks. You really see it all coming alive at our AMC because when I had the opportunity to talk to people in the hallways or on our way to breakouts, I think people are just energized, man. They're fired up about this idea of being successful in their role, being successful as a leader. And that translates into the team. Everybody likes to be part of the winning team. And I think that's what's happening in our restaurants. We've got leaders that know they're leading winning teams. So we're going to do more of that. Operator : The last question today comes from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Christopher O'Cull: I had a follow-up related to execution during peak periods. And in particular, Brian, you've talked about helping teams in the stores have better visibility to know how they're performing in their 15 minutes so they can course-correct, I think, in real time. Is this a fairly new system or a dashboard tool that managers have access to? And then maybe to help us understand the opportunity, I was just wondering if you could tell us what's the difference between the number of entrees during 15-minute peaks for like the top 20% and maybe the bottom 20% performers. Brian Niccol : Yes. So to answer your first question, it is a new tool that we rolled out in January that gave them real-time visibility, which has been hugely powerful. It's great because now when I visit restaurants and ask people, \"Hey, how are you doing?\" They can tell me what their best 15 has been so far. And a lot of them now are so well aware like, hey, I know we can do better than that. So like we might have did 25 in the last 15, but I think we're going to do 35 in the next 15, which is really exciting to hear them have that type of visibility and have kind of clarity so that as a team, they know what they're all working towards. What was your other question? John Hartung : It was the range on throughput. Brian Niccol : Oh, the range to the top and bottom? John Hartung : Yes. And I can take that one. We will see at the bottom -- and these tend to be lower-volume restaurants. You'll see restaurants that are doing in the mid-teens, call it. And then I don't think this is maybe the top 20%. But when we look at the top restaurants, which tells us what the potential is, Brian gave an example during the prepared remarks. In Boston, we've seen as high as 80. We've seen some even higher than that. But I would say the top-performing restaurants are consistently -- or at least on a peak day, it's not going to be in that 40, 50 range. So it's a very wide range. And we're still towards the lower end of that range with a lot of potential ahead of us. Christopher O'Cull: Great. Congratulations on a great start to the year. Brian Niccol : Yes. Thank you. John Hartung : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Brian Niccol : Okay. Thank you. And thanks, everybody, for the questions. Obviously, I appreciate the kind words of recognizing how we're off to a great start. Very proud of the momentum that the business has and really proud of what our operators are doing in our restaurants.  I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, but it was so much fun to be at our AMC with all of our restaurant general managers, apprentices, field leaders, team directors, regional vice presidents, talking about the business. Everybody was clearly aligned on what the task needs to be at hand, which is great culinary, developing great people, great culture, great teams, right, and then ultimately getting great throughput for our customers.  And I think you're seeing the power of focus, the power of alignment and the power, frankly, of Chipotle's culture and great people in these results in the last quarter. Optimistic about where we go from here. It's exciting to think about how we can double this business, going from 3,400, 3,500 restaurants to 7,000 restaurants, getting to 4 million average unit volumes and then continuing to make great progress on throughput and surrounding this brand, I think, with great digital, great marketing. It's really an exciting moment for the brand and the company.  And we're just getting started, which really makes this a lot of fun. So thanks for taking the time. It's great to see the business respond with transactions driving the comp. And we're going to stay focused on what we know works. So we'll talk to you guys in a couple of months. Thanks, everybody. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being record. I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Olsen, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead. Cindy Olsen : Hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today\u2019s call with prepared remarks from Brian Niccol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian Niccol : Thanks Cindy and good afternoon everyone. Before I begin discussing our results, I need to recognize and congratulate Jack Hartung on his nearly 25 years with Chipotle and roughly 80 earnings calls with all of you. I want to thank him for being a great friend, a terrific leader and a champion for our purpose and brand. I'll say a few more words about Jack and Adam before I hand it over to him. Now, turning to our results. The second quarter was outstanding as successful brand marketing, including the return of Chicken Al Pastor as a limited time offer drove strong demand to our restaurants. Additionally, our focus and training around throughput paid off as we were able to meet the stronger demand trends with terrific service and speed in -- driving in \u2013 driving over an 8% transaction comp in the quarter. For the quarter, sales grew 18% to reach nearly $3 billion, driven by an 11.1% comp. In-store sale grew by 24% over last year. Digital sales represented 35% of sales. Restaurant level margin was 28.9%, an increase of 140 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.34, representing 36% growth over last year, and we opened 53 new restaurants, including 46 Chipotlanes. Before I give an update on our five key strategies, I want to take a minute to address the portion concerns that have been brought up in social media. First, there was never a directive to provide less to our customers. Generous portion is a core brand equity of Chipotle. It always has been, and it always will be. With that said, getting the feedback caused us to relook at our execution across our entire system with the intention to always serve our guests delicious, fresh, custom burritos, and bulls with generous portions. To be more consistent across all 3,500 restaurants, we have focused in on those with outlier portion scores based on consumer surveys, and we are reemphasizing training and coaching around ensuring we are consistently making bowls and burritos correctly. We have also leaned in and reemphasized generous portions across all of our restaurants as it is a core brand equity of Chipotle. Our guests expect this now more than ever, and we are committed to making this investment to reinforce that Chipotle stands for a generous amount of delicious, fresh food at fair prices for every customer, visit. The good news is that we are already beginning to see our actions positively reflected in our consumer scores and our value proposition remains very strong. We believe our focus on operations, including throughput as well as terrific marketing and menu innovation, have strengthened the brand and our value proposition. And we will continue to listen to and treasure our guests to earn every transaction. I will turn to our five key strategies that help us to win today while we grow our future. These strategies include running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering an exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level, making the brand visible relevant and love to improve overall guest engagement, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth productivity at our restaurants, support centers and in our supply chain and expanding access convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings in North America and internationally. First, I will start with running successful restaurants. As I mentioned, the improvements we have seen in throughput positions us well to meet the strong demand we experienced in the second quarter, driven by what we call burrito season or our peak seasonality as well the success of Chicken al Pastor. We often are asked why throughput is such an important operational KPI for Chipotle. So I thought I would begin by expanding on this. It is the outcome of a strong operational engine that delivers a great experience for our teams and our guests. In order to deliver exceptional throughput, restaurants need to be fully staffed and properly deployed. Our crew needs to complete all food prep on time and they need to be well trained execute the four pillars. This results in a better overall experience for our crew, which leads to more stability and, therefore, more experienced teams that execute better every day. And for our guests, faster lines with hotter, fresher food. This type of guest experience strengthens our value proposition and drive incremental transactions. Over the last year, we have improved our tools and training to deliver exceptional throughput. This included rightsizing the cadence of digital orders during peak periods and enabling our restaurants to see in real time at the point of sale, the number of entrees in each 15-minute interval. This has received tremendous feedback from our restaurant teams. It has helped to accelerate momentum as it creates excitement and allows our teams to celebrate in a moment when they achieve their goal. And our GMs can coach in the moment when they fall short. In fact, one of our field leaders in New York have 5 five of his eight restaurants achieved their throughput goal in the second quarter, which compares to just one of his restaurants a year ago. While we are seeing progress, we still have a lot of opportunity to increase the percentage of restaurants executing the four pillars. Expo is a great example as it is the most impactful pillar. As a reminder, Expo is the crew member between Salsa and Kash, who helps expedite the bagging and payment process. restaurants within Expo in Expo in place are averaging five incremental entrees in their peak 15 minutes, yet we only see a little over half of our restaurants with place during peak periods. This is certainly better than where it was a couple of quarters ago, but it should be a lot higher. The good news is that I strongly believe we have the right leaders in training in place to keep the momentum going as we continue to gather the data on the execution of the four pillars and provide feedback and coaching on a weekly basis, I am confident throughput can go much higher. This brings me to world-class people leadership. As we mentioned last quarter, crew and GM turnover is at some of the best levels I've seen since I joined the company. And the stability is allowing us to develop and grow our people pipeline to achieve our goal of promoting over 90% from within. We have many inspiring stories at Chipotle of crew members who have grown with the company to become some of our top leaders. In fact, our recently promoted regional Vice President started as a crew member 25 years ago. She moved to the United States at 14 years old without knowing English. At 19, she started working at Chipotle and has moved her way up, including spending time in a language development role, supporting other employees at Chipotle to learn English as a second language. Her people-first mentality is what has made her so successful at hiring, developing and retaining many of our best leaders. And she has two sisters that have each been with Chipotle for over 15 years and our top-performing field leaders. With the addition of her role, we now have three of our 10 regional vice presidents who started as crew members and have made their way up to leading a region and managing over a $1 billion business. These stories really do inspire our entire organization, as the opportunity to develop and grow within Chipotle, along with our industry leading benefits and pay, enables us to attract and retain exceptional people. In fact, as we look to expand to 7,000 restaurants in North America, we will be adding an RVP nearly every year along with hundreds of restaurant leadership roles. Finally, our 50-to-1 stock split : One of the largest in New York stock Exchange history enables our employees' and others to purchase whole shares, at more affordable prices and gives us more flexibility to compensate our top performers in stock, all with the goal to have more employees participate in the financial success of our company. It really is an exciting time to be part of Chipotle. Now, turning to marketing, the Chipotle brand continues to gain momentum as we focus on exceptional operations and making the brand more visible, more relevant, and more loved. Chicken Al Pastor is a great example as it once again surpassed our expectations, reaching over a 20% incidence rate and more importantly, driving incremental transactions and spend. Similar to Carne Asada, we proved that when we bring back a limited time offer, we were able to make it more delicious with seamless execution. And while Chicken al Pastor will end later this summer, I am excited to share that we will be bringing back Smoke Brisket this fall for a limited time. Brisket was among the most requested in many items, as our guests love the combination of Smoked Beef, Charred on the grill and finish with the Brisket sauce made with smoky chili peppers. It took a huge cross-functional effort across supply chain, culinary finance and marketing to bring back this delicious LTO. Our marketing team also continues to find creative ways to generate excitement drive more engagement around our annual promotions. In the second quarter, we had a record-breaking National Burrito Day, where gamified promotion resulted in Chipotle's best sales and digital sales day ever. It also drove an influx of new and lapsed customers and was the best enrollment day of the year for our rewards program. I'm also thrilled to share that later this week, team Chipotle will be visible on the world stage as we leverage our real food for real athletes' platform for those competing in Paris. We highlighted the inspiring journeys of Anthony Edwards, Sophia Smith, Taylor Fritz, Sara Hughes and Jagger Eaton. Their go to Chipotle meals and Howard Greens have been a key component of their training regimens. We will also bring back our gold foil for burritos for a limited time in both North America and France to celebrate all the athletes competing. Shifting to technology and innovation, I want to provide an update on a few of our in-restaurant initiatives starting with the Dual-Sided grill. Over the last year, the Grill has been in 10 restaurants, and we have received consistent feedback that our teams and our guests love it. The grill can cook the chicken and steak in, under half the time it takes on the Plancha with consistent execution and the same sear and char. It also maintains better moisture resulting in juicier chicken and steak with less waste. And for our teams, it takes one of the most complex positions in our restaurants and significantly improves the learning curve. Finally, for high-volume restaurants, it opens up capacity and drives efficiency during morning prep, as chicken and steak can be closer to serving. We are in the process of rolling out the dual sided grill to an additional 74 high-volume restaurants this year, and we'll continue to evaluate the economics prior to rolling it out further across the organization. Additionally, our automated digital makeline in Autocado are making their way through final checks ahead of being pilot tested in their first restaurant. Our food safety and operation teams have worked closely with our technology teams to assure that the design takes into account things like cleaning, speed and accuracy as well as maintaining our high culinary standards. The next step will be to get each device into a restaurant to continue to learn and iterate part of our stage gate process. I'm excited about each of these initiatives, and I strongly believe we will see some impactful back-of-house changes in the years to come, that will help to improve consistency in our restaurants and drive a better overall experience for our teams and our guests. I\u2019m also proud Chipotle continues to be a learning organization. Using the stage gate process is our way to drive discipline around what ultimately gets rolled out. I'm confident this process will further strengthen Chipotle as a leader in technology and innovation. Now moving to our final strategy, which is to expand access and convenience. In North America, we remain on track to open 285 to 315 new restaurants this year, and our openings remain strong across all markets. While our time lines remain consistent to last quarter, our development team continues to see groundbreaks meaningfully higher compared to last year, which should help smooth the cadence of openings as we get into the back half of the year. I also wanted to share an update on our partnership with the Alshaya Group. Our first restaurant in Kuwait has been open for several months and continues to have strong performance. The good news is that the feedback from guests is that the culinary experience is right on par with North America, which is fantastic to hear. It also tells me that when we execute our culinary and delivering an exceptional experience for our guests, Chipotle's brand resonates across geographies. We look forward to opening our second restaurant in Kuwait as well as expanding into Dubai with the Alshaya Group later this year. To close, our crew members, GMs and field leadership delivered an excellent second quarter helped by our committed support centers that enable restaurants to better succeed. We are very fortunate to have a clear purpose and an organization that is full of talented people at all levels. It is exciting to see the progress we have made so far, and I am confident there is much more growth in front of us. Finally, I want to spend a few minutes reflecting on my time with Jack and his extraordinary 25 years at Chipotle. Jack is just as passionate about our brand and our purpose as he is about protecting our economic model. I know you all agree with me that he is one of the best CFOs in the business and has played an instrumental role in growing Chipotle from under 200 restaurants to over 3,500 restaurants, investing in our premium ingredients, and supply chain, protecting our exceptional value proposition and delivering industry-leading economics and returns. As Jack always says, these three characteristics are incredibly difficult to replicate, premium ingredients, affordable prices and attractive margins. Beyond that, he has developed an exceptional finance team, including Adam Rymer, who will become our next Chief Financial Officer. Over the last 15 years, Adam has reported directly or indirectly to and been mentored by Jack in preparation for this role. And importantly, he is just as passionate about our brand, our purpose and protecting our economic model. I'm highly confident he is the right leader to become our next CFO, and that it will be a smooth transition. So again, thank you, Jack, for your friendship, leadership and so many contributions to Chipotle. And with that, I'll turn it over to you. Jack Hartung : Thank you, Brian, for those kind words. I'm extremely fortunate to have had the privilege and honor to serve Chipotle, our employees our shareholders for all these years. While retiring was one of the hardest decisions, it was also one of the easiest I've ever had to make. It was hard because Chipotle is a special brand, a special company and it's full of special people. But it was also easy because I know Chipotle is in great hands with a family of smart, talented people who are committed to our purpose to cultivate a better world. It's also easy because I have a large and growing extended family, and I treasure the time I get to spend with every one of them, and now we'll have the chance to enjoy even more special experiences with them. I'm delighted that Adam Rymer will be our next CFO, and as Brian mentioned, Adam has worked with me for 15 years, and I can tell you he's a very talented leader who knows our brand and our business well, and I'm confident in his ability to help lead Chipotle to the next level. In addition, Jamie McConnell will be elevated to our Chief Accounting and Administrative Officer. And since joining Chipotle six years ago, Jamie has provided great leadership, built strong teams and is well prepared to serve in our new role. With that said, I'll turn now to our quarterly results. Sales in the second quarter grew 18.2% year-over-year to reach about $3 billion as comp sales grew 11.1%, driven by 8.7% transaction growth. Restaurant-level margin of 28.9% increased about 140 basis points compared to last year. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $0.34, representing 36% year-over-year growth. The second quarter had unusual expenses related to unrealized loss on investment and an increase in legal reserves, which negatively impacted our earnings per share by $0.01, leading to GAAP per share of $0.33. Sales comps were highest in April, driven by the Easter shift, a strong reaction to the return of Chicken al Pastor and several successful activations, including National Burrito day. Comps settled back to around 6% in June, and continue to be driven by positive transactions. July has been more difficult to read so far due to the fourth holiday, weather disruptions in Texas and the impact from a recent technology outage, but we believe the underlying trend remains similar to June. We are maintaining our full year comp guidance of mid- to high single-digit. And as a reminder, we will roll off about 3 points of pricing in early Q4 as we lap our menu price increase from last year. Before I go through the individual P&L line items, I want to give an overview of what to anticipate. We expect our margins will be under pressure for the next couple of quarters. Most, if not all of this pressure is seasonal, temporary, or it's an investment that we can offset through efficiencies, and we believe our industry-leading margin structure is still intact. I'll now go through each of the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 29.4% in line with last year Benefit of last year's menu price increase was offset by inflation in avocados, increased oil usage and higher incidence of beef as a result of the continued success of Braised Beef Barbacoa marketing initiative. For Q3, we expect our cost of sales to be just below 31%. About one-third of the step-up is due to the higher protein costs as we roll out Chicken al Pastor and then launched Smoke Brisket later in the quarter. About one-third is due to an uptick in dairy and avocado prices and the final one-third are about 40 to 60 basis points is an investment we are making as we focus on outlier restaurants to ensure correct and generous portion. We expect this investment will ease from these levels somewhat. We also believe that we can offset the remaining investment with efficiencies and innovation over time. While avocado prices are higher than the very favorable levels we have seen over the past several quarters, this is in line with our expectations from earlier this year. Additionally, we are less impacted by the recent volatility in the Mexican avocado market, as our supply chain team has done a fantastic job of diversifying our exposure, and in the third quarter, the majority of our avocados come from Peru. Outside of avocados and the protein mix shift, we anticipate underlying cost of sales inflation will be in the low single-digits range for the remainder of the year. Labor costs for the quarter were 24.1%, a decrease of about 20 basis points from last year, as the benefit from sales leverage more than offset wage inflation. For Q3, we expect our labor costs to be in the low 25% range due to seasonally lower sales, with wage inflation to remain at about 6%. And as a reminder, about half of the wage inflation is due to the nearly 20% step-up in wages in California as a result of the increase in minimum wage for restaurant companies like ours that took effect in April. Other operating costs for the quarter were 12.9%, a decrease of about 100 basis points from last year. The decrease was primarily driven by sales leverage. Marketing and promo costs were 2.1% of sales in Q2. And in Q3, we expect marketing costs to remain in the low 2% range with the full year to be in the high 2% range. In Q3, other operating costs are expected to be in the high 13% range, due to seasonally lower sales and higher seasonal expenses like utilities and maintenance and repair. Based on these expectations provided, we anticipate restaurant level margin to be around 25% in Q3. As I mentioned earlier, some of the pressure is seasonal, like the shift from Chicken al Pastor to Brisket. Some is temporary like the higher prices in avocados and dairy, which if they persist, we can address with menu prices overtime. And finally, we're confident that the investment we're making to ensure we are delivering correct and generous portions can be offset by efficiencies and innovation overtime. G&A for the quarter was $175 million on a GAAP basis or about $171 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding $4 million increase in legal reserves. G&A also includes $122 million in underlying G&A, $43 million related to non-cash stock compensation and $6 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes and equity vesting and exercises. We expect our underlying G&A to be around $128 million in Q3 and step-up each quarter as we make investments in people to support ongoing growth. Anticipated stock comp will be around $40 million in Q3, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual results. We also expect to recognize around $6 million related to higher bonus accruals and employer taxes associated with shares that vest during the quarter, bringing our anticipated total DNA in Q3 to around $175 million. Depreciation for the quarter was $84 million, or 2.8% of sales, and we expect depreciation to step up slightly each quarter, as we continue to open more restaurants. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 25% for GAAP as well as for non-GAAP. Our effective tax rate benefited from option exercises and equity vesting above the grant values. And for fiscal 2024, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items. On June 26, we successfully completed our 50-to-1 stock split : One of the largest in New York Stock Exchange history. We believe this will make our stock more accessible to our employees as well as a broader range of investors. Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt. During the quarter, we repurchased $151 million of our stock at an average price of $63.52. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $650 million remaining under our share authorization program. We opened 53 new restaurants in the second quarter, of which 46 at Chipotle. We continue to anticipate opening between 285 to 315 new restaurants in 2024 with over 80% having at Chipotle, and we remain on track to move towards the high-end of the 8% to 10% range by 2025, assuming time line conditions do not worsen. To close, I also want to thank our employees for all their hard work in driving our strong results and for continuing to build and grow Chipotle. I also want to reflect how our historic 50-for-1 stock split. When Chipotle went public at $22 per share -- I was very optimistic that we have a special brand with a tremendous growth opportunity. I'm not sure I could have ever imagined then that we would split the shares at just over $3,200 per share, but I did envision that we would reach over 3,000 restaurants, as we have today in the U.S. And today, I know we have a special brand with industry-leading economics and returns. I'm also just as optimistic about our growth opportunity to reach 7,000 restaurants in North America and to expand internationally. And we further our purpose of cultivating a better world we'll continue to drive extraordinary value for our guests, our employees and our shareholders. It is truly and exciting time to be part of this purpose-driven company with seemingly limitless opportunity. And with that I\u2019ll open lines for your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : Hi. Good afternoon. First, Jack, congratulations on an amazing career at Chipotle. And you're going to be missed, and we look forward to working with Adam going forward. Jack Hartung : Thanks David. David Tarantino : So, my question is about the sales trends you called out, I think you said the comps moderated into the kind of 6% ballpark in June, and you think that underlying trend is carried over into July. While that's very good relative to what we're seeing from a lot of brands, it is slower than what you were running previously. So, I just wanted to get your thoughts on why you think you saw that slowdown -- whether it's macro or something inside the business that may have caused that? Brian Niccol : Why don't I start and then Jack can fill in. The -- look, first of all, David, I would tell you the quarter was really spectacular. And when we look at brand metrics, they've never been stronger. So, value, food scores all the key metrics to make sure that the brand is in a good spot really continue to improve throughout the quarter. And then from an operating standpoint, I don't know if you've been to our restaurants recently, but I think the teams are doing a terrific job on continuing to deliver quick culinary grade throughput. And then, obviously, we mentioned in our earlier comments, we've doubled down on making sure we're also providing great portions, which is, I think, a key equity for this business as well. One of the things we've seen, which is consistent with what we saw last year, is this kind of seasonal move with kind of the summer change of behaviors. And so obviously, we're trying to understand what that looks like because it appears to be new trends since coming out of COVID. So, that's one piece of the puzzle. And then obviously, we're trying to understand if there are any macro things going on as well. But the one thing we know for sure is the feedback on the business from our customers has been great value, great culinary and improving speed. And those are the things we can control, and those are the things we're going to forward. Jack, I don't know if you want to add anything. Jack Hartung : No, I mean, just to add some more text to like seasonality things like July 4 used to be a weekend and now it looks like it's two weekends. So, it looks like the combination of there's a holiday and then work from home is more acceptable. Now it just seems like the holidays, it used to be three or four days or so. It seems like they're stretching out a little bit. We even saw for the first time ever on Juneteenth, we saw a little softness there as well. So, we wonder if that's also kind of a work-from-home environment as well. So the last couple of summers have been very hard to predict. And so we think that's definitely a big part of what we're seeing. David Tarantino : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Sara Senatore : Thank you. First of all, congratulations to both Jack and Adam. I've enjoyed working with both of you, but the question I have first is just a quick follow-up. If you could just maybe talk a little bit about the composition of the price mix and how you're thinking about that going forward, given some of the reinvestments that you are making? And then also wanted to get a sense of store growth and how that is progressing. Just I know there have been endemic problems across the industry, but the goal was to get the growth rate higher and perhaps into that 10% range next year. So, any updates there? Thanks. Jack Hartung : Yes, I'll start with the components of the comps, Sara. Transactions were up 8.7% during the quarter. We also had a menu price increase effectively was 3.3%. That was 3% that we took, effectively a 3% that we took last year, and then we had the 1% effective that we took for the FAST Act as well. And we did have a negative mix, and the negative mix was based on group size. The negative mix was 1%. Group size was down about 2%, but that was offset by we did have some add-ons, mostly in chips, queso, and extra meat as well. What we're seeing as we moved into June, we're still seeing transactions be the main driver. So, transactions were in the 3%, 3.5% during the month of June. And then on openings, I mean, we're still on track, Sara. We're not seeing the timelines really change at all. We did see some modest improvements so far this year, but the pipeline is very robust, and we feel good about the openings for this year. If that continues, just based on the inventory building alone, and if timelines don't worsen, we think we can get close to, if not all the way to that 10% in the next year. Sara Senatore : Got it. Thank you. And just pricing for the rest of the year? Jack Hartung : So, we have the 3% from last year that runs out in the middle of October. We'll continue to have California. Right now, we have no plans for further pricing. I mean, we'll look at how the rest of the next few months unfold. We'd love to get through the rest of the year based on what's going on, and again, we don't know how much is seasonality, whether there's something bigger going on. But it'd be great to not have to take any price for the rest of this year. Sara Senatore : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thanks very much, and Jack and Adam, congratulations to you both. Just wanted to ask Jack a little bit more on the margin commentary that you made, specifically as it relates to some of that pressure over the coming quarters. If you could dive in a little more to some of the moving pieces there, and maybe some of the efficiency offsets that you spoke to? Thank you. Jack Hartung : Yes. So, there's three main buckets. We've got inflation. Inflation generally has been relatively benign. We have two items we called out, avocado and dairy. Both of those ingredients we do expect either near the end of the year or into early next year. We think those will normalize. Avocados, as you guys know, has been really a benefit. We've had great avocado prices for the last several quarters. And so even the current avocado prices we're seeing right now are more in the normal range, but we think that those will ease through the end of the year or into next year, so both of those we feel good about. We do have pricing power, so we'll watch that very closely, and at some point in the future we'll be able to offset that. The other item that we talked about, Brian mentioned, we decided that that this brand equity called Generous Portions is something we don't want to take for granted. We don't want to take something that's been a positive for all these years and then have it turned out to be a negative because of some of the social media comment. So, we've made this investment, we'll continue to make the investment. We already have a number of initiatives underway. Some of them are operational. Some of those are supply chain efficiencies. We won't go into details of what those are, but we do think over the next couple of quarters that we'll be able to see some of efficiencies and I think that's really in terms of where our margins are and what we think-- Dennis Geiger : Just to move from Chicken Al Pastor. Jack Hartung : Yes. I mean, that's clearly temporary. Dennis Geiger : Yes. Jack Hartung : I mean, you have the mix shift. Clearly that's going to be in LTO, once we move from brisket into the next LTO, especially if it's a chicken. Not only will that reverse, but it'll turn into a positive for us. Dennis Geiger : Make sense. Thanks and congratulations. Operator : The next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please go ahead. Peter Saleh : Great. Thanks. I did want to ask about labor, if I could. I think, Brian, I think you mentioned a little over half of the units with an expeditor during peak hours. What's the holdup in terms of expanding the expeditor to more units, because it feels like that's a key driver of throughput? Is labor just really tight? Is there a lot of turnover? Just any thoughts around that would be helpful. Thank you. Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So, look, the good news is we've made progress to get the 50%. The other piece of good news is, we've got experienced in the past. We've been able to get to that number closer to 70%-plus. So, I'm confident with our operational leadership that's going on in the field right now, and here's a key piece of us think that gives us the ability to improve from where we are. We have really great staffing levels right now with turnover at some of the best levels it's been to-date. And so the fact that we're getting these teams to be, I would say, more cohesive, more centered on the culture of great throughput, combined with great culinary, I'm confident that these teams will continue to improve. The other thing, too, you guys might have seen is we talked about this, giving our teams the visibility through reporting has really enabled them to enhance their performance. And I think just repetition using the tools that we have, and then just making sure that we don't have any real disruption to what the organization needs to be focused on. I think we've done a nice job of keeping the teams focused. If you look at our leadership hierarchy, I think you talked to anybody in the operational leadership hierarchy. They all know we want great deployment. We want great culinary. We want great throughput. We want great culture. And like you, I wish it would go faster. I'm sure the good news is that we're making progress. And that's what I continue to keep an eye on. And I continue to make that we're staying consistent with our message. And we're supporting the teams with tools to set them up for success. Operator : The next question comes from Christine Cho with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Christine Cho : Thank you so much. Congratulations Jack and Adam and congrats on a great quarter. I just wanted to get -- to pick your brain on the overall industry trying to win traffic share with discounts and promotions. And I think you mentioned that to pull a value proposition is still very strong. But do you see any shift within the consumers that you can highlight? And specifically, I think a question for Brian. I think the last instance when we had this pretty fierce price competition, you were kind of on the other side of the fence. So, any key lessons you would take away from that experience back then? And how that applies to your plans going forward in navigating through this environment? Thank you. Brian Niccol : Yes. So, look, there's a lot there. But I'll start with -- I think I've said this over and over again. The thing that we need to make sure we do really well is great culinary, great burritos and bulls and treasure every single guest that comes into our restaurants, whether it's in-line or online. And when we do that, we see our value scores our brand become more loved. And one of the things that I keep an eye on closely is, are we gaining market share? And what's great to see is we're gaining market share every month, okay? So as we stay focused on executing Chipotle's core business, we see the results not only in the comp and transactions that we're delivering, but also the market share gains that we're making. And I've said this before Chipotle is not built on this idea of promotional footballing prices, okay? Chipotle is built on this idea of great culinary, exactly how you want it and with great speed. And look, we\u2019ve had a simple idea. Great food done fast. We keep executing against that simple idea. I think we'll continue to get market share. And I think our value scores will continue to go up and our team will continue to be successful. And -- obviously, we've got to let other people play how they want to play. We're going to play our offense throughout process. Operator : The next question comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess just following up on that. I think in the prior few quarters, you had talked about kind of outperforming amongst lower-income consumers. And I apologize if you mentioned that, it's a really choppy connection on my end. But are you still seeing that kind of strength across income cohorts? And on the Brisket, is that something we should expect, Jack, to impact the fourth quarter as well? Thanks. Brian Niccol : So, I'll answer your first question. The good news is we are seeing transaction growth from every income cohort, which I think speaks to the strength of our brand and value proposition. And then as we continue to march forward, our goal is to continue to give people the bowls and burritos that they want at the speed that really delights them. So, hopefully, that continues to resonate with every income cohort. To-date, it has -- and from what we see in our consumer research, it will continue to delight every income cohort. On your Brisket question, I'll let Jack jump in on that. Jack Hartung : Yes, Sharon, what I can tell you is there will be an impact, but there's other things going on as well. So, our food costs -- we expect our food cost to be similar in Q4 as Q3. So, not another up. Sharon Zackfia : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you. The question was on the automated digital make line. Just in terms of what you've seen in your cultivate center and your culinary center, how scalable is this machine? In other words, if you do decide and like what you see in the stage-gate process, how fast could this potentially be nationally? Does your equipment supplier have the capacity to kind of get up and running for the entire system is kind of the first question? And then secondly, related to that, if we are talking about consistency and speed as being two things that you want to do really well, it does seem like an automated make line would be perfect for that, not just on the digital make line, but even putting it into the front counter as well, whether kiosk ordering or app ordering or whatever that case may be. Would that be considered as part of an early stage gate process as well once you establish it on the back make line? Thank you. Jack Hartung : Yes, and thanks for the question. Obviously, we're really excited about Python and the automated digital make line. We will have that in a restaurant probably here at the end of August, early September, somewhere around there, which will be really exciting to see. Look, obviously we want to stay after consistency and speed. Those are two equities of the brand that are really important. The good news is we've got a bunch of different initiatives in the stage gate process. So, look, I never like to have all my eggs in one basket, right? And what I'm really delighted about is we've got things that make us more efficient with prep, whether it's avocado, a veggie slicer, a dual sided grill, looking at modifications to our rice cooker, our fryer equipment. So, there's a lot of things going on back at house to make us more effective culinary-wise, prep-wise, which then sets us up to be successful consistently on the front line and the digital make line. I've talked about these things also where we're also experimenting with AI and vision to ensure that our teams get the support. I'm actually reading a great book right now, it's called Co-Intelligence, it talks about how you use AI as a partner. And that's really what, you've heard us talk about this, is co-biotics, right? I think now this is, I like this term co-intelligence, to help our teams be more effective with forecasting, executing every single bowl correctly, bringing things up exactly correctly. So, look, I'm really excited about all the things we have in the pipeline. Obviously, we've spent a lot of time talking about hyping because it's probably the most visible, it looks pretty darn cool too. But I just want to make sure it's important we talk about, we've got a lot of things from an innovation standpoint that really understand the operating model to make us more efficient, better culinary every single time, consistent every single time, and frankly, makes the job easier for our team members to be successful, which then results in, I think, great outcomes for our customers. So, a bit more answer to your question, but I think it's important to just highlight hyping's a great tool, but there's a lot of tools we're working on that I think are going to make us better in the future. John Ivankoe : That's great. Jack, congratulations. Jack Hartung : Thanks John. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Charles with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles : Great. Thank you. And just like everyone else, congrats to both Jack and Adam. Jack, what a ride it's been. Jack, curious just with the guidance, why keep the mid-single-digit part just given the blowout from 2Q as well as the fact that it sounds like July spotty, but around that 6% trend. That mid-single-digit piece suggests a pretty wide range of outcomes for the back half of the year and implies some deceleration potentially coming. So, can you just talk more about the guidance philosophy? Jack Hartung : Yes, I mean, there's two things going on. One is, like we said, since the pandemic, the summer months have been more difficult to predict. Like the first year when you'd have the normal going back to school and, or leaving school and then going back to school, that was very, very different. Last year, vacations really were pulled forward. This year, vacations were pulled forward again, and it looks like they've even stepped up again. So, there's difficulty in predicting the seasonality. The other thing keep mind is we do have 300 basis points of pricing rolling off. So, now what we hope to do is hopefully in a couple of quarters, we're talking about how the guidance ended up being perhaps on the conservative side. But right now, with everything that's going on, whether it's seasonality or something that's more of a bigger approach or a bigger impact on the consumer. We think this is the right guidance level. And our intent is giving you a little bit more granularity in terms of what the months are looking like to give you kind of idea an idea of what we're seeing right now. And I think with Brisket coming up, we're very optimistic that was a big demand the first time. We actually just couldn't even keep it in stock it. We ran out of it so fast. We're optimistic, but we also want to be cautious in this environment. Andrew Charles : That's helpful. And in past years, before the inflation issue, we saw that there was typically about a 2% price increase, 2.5% price increase taken in December. What's the likelihood we see that again for next year? I know you're seeing some temporary margin headwinds. But as we think about pricing levels for next year, I mean what's the likelihood we see something coming in December? Jack Hartung : Well, that's a long time away. I assume you're thinking December 2025. That's a long ways away. In this environment, we love the idea of being able to get through the rest of this year without a price increase. Where we would feel better in terms of the timing of a price increase, is in an environment where the economy is robust and healthy. The consumer is feeling very, very healthy, and they're spending and the restaurant industry in general is going well. And transactions are accelerating, not decelerating. That's a great environment when you use inflation to take a modest increase our price increases have gone well, but we would not want to take that for granted. So I think it would be really data dependent like what's going on in inflation. But as importantly, what's going on with the consumer, what's going on with transaction trends. Andrew Charles : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Lauren Silberman : Thanks a lot. I wanted to ask on the LTO strategy. You have one in spring, one in fall. It just seems like you generally comped the LTO comp for lack of a better phrase pretty consistently. What enables you to keep growing LTOs year-over-year incidence rates growing each year? And do you tend to see like during the periods of LTOs that comps actually accelerate even though it's off a higher base? Brian Niccol : Yes. So, look, the good news is we have a nice mix with our menu news of items that we've done in the past as well as completely new menu items. And I think what we've demonstrated is when we go back to something like a Chicken al Pastor or Carne Asada, we seem to be able to talk about it in a much more exciting way maybe than we did the original time because we learned some things on it. We execute better, because we know how to train on it. The teams are familiar with the execution. So, that's been really nice to see. The one thing I want to remind everybody on all these things, though, is one of the ways make all these initiatives much more effective, great operational execution. If we have terrific throughput, terrific deployment, and we execute culinary really well, the menu innovation gets amplified, because we give our guests a great experience. So, it does a great job of bringing in incremental customers, incremental transactions. But if we have soft operations, these efforts won't be nearly as effective. So, I really think it's a combination of stronger operations than maybe the last time when we executed this program combined with, I think, a more informed marketing program than we did at the prior time. So, that's one of the things I love about this organization. We're committed to learning. We're committed to always figure out how we can be better. And I think that's what you see coming out of Chipotle time and time again. Lauren Silberman : Great. Thanks. If I could just do a quick follow-up on the 3Q guide. I understand a lot of noise, but can we -- is it safe to assume that the 25% restaurant level margin guide implies about a 6% underlying comp for the quarter? Jack Hartung : That's a fair assumption. Yes, you're in the ballpark. Lauren Silberman : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Jon Tower with Citi. Please go ahead. Jon Tower : Great. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats, Jack and Adam. Maybe just a quick follow-up and then a question. First, you had mentioned earlier the generous portion stuff that you're going to be doing in the short-term. Are you doing anything to message that to the consumer maybe something beyond what Brian you've already done on social media? And then I guess my question is more along the lines of -- there's obviously been a fairly significant price increase in California because of the wage rate hikes. Any sort or change in consumer behavior in that market that you're seeing at your stores or perhaps more broadly across the industry that you could speak to? Brian Niccol : So, look, your first question, part of the reason why we went and looked across the system was when we got the feedback on the portion sizes. We've always felt the key equity of Chipotle is these generous portion sizes. So, we wanted to make sure we're executing consistently across the system. And we've probably found about 10% or more of restaurants that we really view as outliers that needed to be retrained re-coached to be executing against what we believe are the right standards. At the same time, we collectively said, look, we do not go back one inch on our -- that equity of generous portion sizes. So, we communicate to the entire system. And look, I'm already seeing it in social media, people commenting on the burritos, the bowls that they're getting. And I think that is the best source of marketing is the word of mouth as people have these experiences with Chipotle. But the thing I want to emphasize is for 90% of our restaurants, they're doing business as usual. So, I don't want it to be lost on the fact that this really was something where we doubled down as a system, but we really needed to kind of train up roughly 10% of the system. So, I think it's going to continue to be a key equity of ours. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's an equity we care about. So, we'll invest in it, and we'll figure out how to make sure we consistently do it every time. Jack Hartung : Yes. And then -- and then on California, so I'll make a comment or two. So yes, what we've seen is really across the entire state, we've seen a step down in the industry we've seen individual data points within the individual restaurants. And we've seen reports that there really has been a pullback in spending we've seen it as well. We've also seen that when we've seen individual restaurants. There's not a correlation between the step back in the spending versus the major price increase that was taken. And so it looks like there's just kind of a macro impact of less spending in the restaurant. We saw the same thing. Unfortunately, we raised prices by 100 basis points. We normally don't see much resistance. We still resistant to the point where we didn't get the 100 basis points at all. So, saw a pullback that equal the effect of menu price increase that we took. And it looks like that's about equal to what the pullback in the industry is. Jon Tower : Got it. Thanks for taking the questions. Jack Hartung : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Brian Harbour : Thanks. Yes. Good afternoon and Jack and Adam, congratulations as well. The Barbacoa kind of marketing initiative, could you just comment on that? Was it kind of a pretty material driver? Did people respond as you expected? Are there kind of other opportunities to do that sort of thing? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, that was really effective. I think the marketing team did a great job of informing people of a great product that we have on our menu all the time. And as a result, we saw incidents go up and I think it's going to be something we'll revisit in the future. The good news is we got another hidden gem, I think, with Carnitas that we'll evaluate as well. But yes, you'll probably see us do that again because it worked really well for us. Brian Harbour : Okay, great. And Brian, your comments on automation but also some of the other kind of initiatives that you mentioned. How fast do you think some of those can show up? Is this the sort of thing where we start to see it in a year or two? Or are some of these longer-term? Do we see it in the form of kind of continued margin upside? Or like how should we kind of assess some of those as outsiders? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, I think, like you would expect with any good portfolio of ideas, we have short-term, medium-term, and longer-term, right? And some of those things are much closer in versus something like a hyphen is a little bit further out. And the thing that's great is we're validating all of it through the stage gate. This is one thing I love about the stage gate process is it doesn't slow things down. It just ensures we don't have any unintended consequences. So, that as we roll things out, we're informed with what we're executing. But yes, some of those things can happen on much faster timelines and some of the other things take a little bit longer. So it's a real, it's a really nice blend of, I would say, near-term, mid-term, and long-term. Operator : The next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Danilo Gargiulo : Thank you. Brian, last time we discussed, you were talking about throughput that was in the mid-20s. Where do you stand today? And can you maybe help us understand the major catalyst of throughput acceleration from here on? Brian Niccol : Yes, sure. So, obviously, we saw our biggest improvement in throughput during the month of April, which was great to see. And we continue to see great throughput execution from folks. The thing that's going to push the throughput forward even further is ultimately the deployment being done correctly, right? So if we get that expo number to a higher percentage, not surprisingly, that expo position is the biggest impact on throughput gains. And so that's why you hear us talking about that position is kind of like the key metric of, are we deployed correctly to execute great throughput during peak? So, I'm optimistic that we're going to move that 50% number up, and I'm optimistic that we'll be able to move from the mid-20s to the high-20s in the not too distant future. Danilo Gargiulo : Great. And can you please provide an update on the restaurant-level margins and demand that you're seeing in European markets? I mean, you're making some bold investments over there, changing leadership as well. So, when do you think it's going to be realistic to expect an acceleration in units in Europe as well? Brian Niccol : Yes, look, I'm really excited about the progress that our team has made over in Europe, in really short order. They've taken a lot of the tools in the U.S. We put them into place in Europe. I think we're managing food better. We're managing the supply chain better, managing deployment better. The culinary, I think, has really improved. So not surprising, you're seeing -- we're seeing nice improvements both in top line and bottom-line. So, I'm optimistic that we're going to be proving those as investable markets to kind of go even faster down the road, similar to what happened in Canada. So, the team has made nice progress. I'm sure they'll be busy in Paris with Olympics coming up, but I'm really, really delighted with Brian have done in kind of short order. Operator : And our last question will come from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Please go ahead. Chris O'Cull: Thanks and congratulations Jack and Adam. I just wanted to ask, Brian, do you see any signs that the increases in value promotions by the QSR chains have had any impact on the company's results? Brian Niccol : We really haven't. And I kind of point to the fact that we're gaining market share according to the data we get back. And the brand metrics continue to strengthen, and one of those key strength components is our value proposition. So, when I kind of connect all the dots of market share gains, strength in the brands, strengthen our operational execution, it appears some of these promotions are not having an impact on our business as of this moment. So, again, the thing we have to do is play our offense. And our offense, as I mentioned earlier, is great culinary, great teams, great throughput and that results in great Burritos and Bowls for our customers. So we're going to stay after it. And if the environment gets tougher, the good news for us is if the prior macro issues or recessions that we face, Chipotle is one of the one of the last ones impacted. And we were of the first ones out slowdown. So, it gives me confidence that we've got the right focus, the right operating model. And I think it's going to continue to resonate with customers. Chris O'Cull: That's helpful. And just as a follow-up. You talked a lot about product innovation, obviously, that has been very successful. And one of the factors, I think, Jack, you mentioned benefiting April sales was the marketing activation event. And I'm just wondering, can you help us understand how impactful these events can be and whether this is something the company could consider using more frequently if the consumer spending environment were to become more challenging? Brian Niccol : Yes. Look, it's a great question. And this is really, I think, the power of our combination of our digital marketing/consumer database, combined with what I think are some really clever marketing moments, right, like National Burrito Day, National Avocado Day. Obviously, we have the ability to turn on block mode. We have the ability to do other things that I think are very insight-based that we know resonate with the Chipotle customer. And I think that's one thing that's great about having such a big Canada base on our customers and then doing, I think, a really effective job using digital marketing or traditional marketing tools to communicate these unique opportunities with our customers. So, you'll continue to see us use it. And I think it's a huge advantage that we have, the strength of this loyalty program combined with a really talented marketing team. Chris O'Cull: Great. Thanks, and congratulations guys. Brian Niccol : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Niccol for any closing remarks. Brian Niccol : All right. Thank you. And thanks, everybody, for all the questions. Again, I do want to recognize Mr. Jack Hartung on having the privilege to work with Jack as well as, I think Chipotle and everybody involved with Chipotle has a huge thank you from Mr. Hartung. So thank you again, Jack. Jack Hartung : Thank you. Brian Niccol : And obviously, we're excited for Adam to step into the CFO role and then obviously, Jamie McConnell stepping up into her Chief Accounting role. So terrific leaders under, again, Jack's leadership that are going to get the opportunity to make even bigger contributions to this great brand. So congratulations, everybody. And then on the business, obviously, it was an outstanding quarter. I couldn't be prouder of the results the organization and what we accomplished. We get 8% transaction growth in any environment is pretty special. And I think it's a testament, great operations, great marketing, great digital. I mean we just -- we've got a lot of things going the right way. And as a result, the brand metrics have never been better. The value proposition is super strong. And whatever is in store for us. I'm sure we'll have our ups and downs. I always go back to having a strong brand with a strong organization sets you up for success. And I'm confident that we are building from a position of strength. And I look forward to finishing the year strong. Obviously, we've got a couple of more quarters to go. But I just want to reemphasize what a great quarter. What a great team and really proud of where we are and where we're headed. So thank you, everybody. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions]. Please note today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Olsen, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead. Cindy Olsen : Hello, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on our Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our actual results could differ materially from those projections in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Scott Boatwright, Interim Chief Executive Officer; and Jack Hartung, President and Chief Strategy Officer and Adam Rymer, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire Executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. Scott Boatwright : Thanks Cindy and hello everyone. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I know I speak on behalf of everyone at Chipotle when I say that we are grateful for Brian's leadership and for the transformation he led. Over the past several years, we built a strong team with a great culture and have developed compelling and successful strategies together. With that said, after leading our operations for the last seven years, I'm excited and honored for the opportunity to lead Chipotle as our Interim CEO. To start, there are three things I want to make very clear today. The first is that I'm extremely passionate about our brand and purpose. We are truly a special company that cares about the culinary heritage that Chipotle was founded upon. And our purpose of cultivating a better world resonates with our teams at all levels of our organization, as well as with the guests we serve in our restaurants each and every day. I'm also passionate about our people, and I strongly believe we have the best in the industry, both in our restaurants and at our support centers. Since joining Chipotle in 2017, I've had the privilege and responsibility of leading our restaurant teams as we have grown from under 2,300 restaurants to over 3,600 restaurants today, employing over 125,000 people. I can tell you firsthand how hard our teams work to provide our fresh, delicious, and customizable culinary experience at accessible prices to millions of people every day. These exceptional people are the backbone of our great brand. And the third is that our strategy is not changing. I have worked alongside our talented executive team to craft and evolve our successful strategy, and we will continue to execute against it. This includes our long-term targets of expanding to 7,000 restaurants in North America, increasing our AUVs to over 4 million, and expanding our restaurant-level margins and growing internationally. Now, before I dive into our five strategies, I want to run through our third quarter results. We had another outstanding quarter with positive transaction growth every month. We saw momentum build throughout the quarter as the impact from summer seasonality normalized and as we successfully launched Smoked Brisket, which is off to a fantastic start. For the quarter, sales grew 13% to reach $2.8 billion, driven by a 6% comp with over 3% transaction comp growth. In-restaurant sales grew by 80% over last year. Digital sales represented 34% of sales. Restaurant level margin was 25.5%, a decrease of 80 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.27, representing 17% growth over last year. And we opened 86 new restaurants, including 73 Chipotlane. The momentum of the business has continued into the fourth quarter with accelerating transaction trends, and we are maintaining our full year guidance of mid to high single-digit comps. Now let me provide an update on our five key strategies that have helped us win today and will grow our future. These strategies include learning successful restaurants with a people-accountable culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants, support centers, and in our supply chain, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining diverse talent at every level, making the brand visible, relevant, and loved to acquire new guests and improve overall guest engagement, and expanding access and convenience by accelerating new restaurant openings in North America and internationally. Let's start with running successful restaurants and our progress on throughput. We have mentioned this in the past, but it's important to say it again. Throughput is a core focus for Chipotle because it is the outcome of a strong operational engine that delivers a great experience for our guests and teams. And execution in our restaurant is improving as we continue to build our throughput muscle. Last quarter, we began concentrating our efforts on the expo position as it is a critical pillar of throughput. As a reminder, this is the crew member between salsa and cash who helps expedite the order assembly and payment process. Restaurants with an expo in place are averaging five incremental entrees in their peak 15 minutes. We are often asked why it's so challenging to execute this key pillar of throughput. Well the crew member responsible for the expo position may be doing other tasks like prep which prevents them from being properly deployed. In late August, we made a decision to have the manager on duty deployed to the expo position during peaks. This has helped to improve the percentage of restaurants with an expo in place to over 60% compared to just over 50% last quarter. It has also helped to drive accountability, improve communication with the guests and ensure we are properly ringing up each order. While we are making great progress on executing the four pillars of throughput, we still have work to do. Of the restaurants that do not have the four pillars in place, we are finding that often our crew members are still prepping food during peak periods. The fact is, preparing our delicious food is a lot of work and requires strong culinary skills. Our teams are beginning prep at 6 or 7 a.m. in the morning to be able to deliver our food on time when we open. This includes slicing and dicing produce, hand-mashing avocados to make our delicious guacamole, frying on chips every day, and grilling items like the heat of veggies and adobo chicken on the plancha. In addition to coaching and training around throughput, we are also exploring ways to make the prep process easier on our teams while ensuring we are maintaining or improving upon our high culinary standards. This brings me to technology and innovation. We now have several initiatives in stage gate that can help to improve the prep and cooking process and drive a better experience for our teams. Two, that I'm particularly excited about are the dual-sided plancha and the produce slicer. As we mentioned last quarter, we are in the process of rolling out the dual-sided plancha to an incremental 74 restaurants, which will be complete by the end of next month. And as part of the stage gate process, we are now evaluating and implementing the dual-sided plancha into new restaurant openings, as well as retrofitting existing restaurants, and we'll have more to share on this early next year. Additionally, over the last year, we have been testing a produce slicer. In our restaurants, slicing and dicing vegetables like jalapenos and bell peppers is one of the most time-consuming and repetitive tasks. It would be an understatement to say our teams are excited about this new tool. In fact, at our all-major conference in March, nearly 5,000 managers and above-restaurant leaders gave it a standing ovation. The new produce slicer drives improved efficiency, which will allow our teams to complete the prep process on time in every restaurant, resulting in better deployment at peak and better throughput. And it also improves our culinary by delivering consistent cut sizes. I'm excited to share that we are beginning to roll out the new produce slicer in all restaurants, which should be complete by next summer. Beyond these two initiatives are augmented make line by Hyphen and Autocado, which cuts, cores, and scoops avocados were installed into their first restaurants for pilot testing during the quarter. These are both highly customized technologies that could provide big unlocks for us in the future. We have already received a lot of learnings on both innovations from our crew and our guests that will be used for future iterations. As you can see, we have a number of initiatives underway, and I envision significant back-of-the-house changes in the near future that will drive efficiencies and improve the consistency of our culinary in our restaurants. This will enable our teams to focus on and execute the four pillars of throughput better than we ever have and deliver an exceptional experience for our guests in restaurants every day. Let's shift to world-class people leadership. In addition to innovation that helps to better enable the preparation of our delicious food, we are also rolling out a new technology platform across all restaurants that will make the hiring process simpler, faster, and more automated. The new AI hiring platform automates the communication and scheduling between applicants and our general managers, reducing the amount of time it takes to hire an employee for an in-restaurant position by as much as 75%. The automation of this administrative task will allow our GMs to spend more time coaching and developing their teams and providing excellent hospitality for our guests. And it also gives us a competitive advantage against the other restaurant chains in the high-volume hiring market because we can hire talent faster. As I mentioned earlier, I'm passionate about our people and building a strong culture that recruits, retains, and grows the very best. And I'm thrilled to share that Chipotle was ranked first among 400 of the largest publicly traded companies in the American Opportunity Index of best places for high school graduates to start a career. The rankings were based on how well a company hires entry-level employees, promotes from within, and prepares them for opportunities when they leave. One of the very best benefits we offer our teams is our career advancement opportunity. We have so many stories of crew members who have started at Chipotle and grown within the organization, resulting in life-changing careers, including several to the position of Regional Vice President, overseeing hundreds of restaurants, and a billion dollar plus business. In fact, our team director out of the Chicago region has one of these inspiring journeys. She came to the US at the age of seven with her parents and brother as refugees. And at the age of 18, she started working at Chipotle as a crew member for her first job out of high school. She has advanced within Chipotle to become a top performing team director and now is responsible for 61 restaurants or almost $200 million in sales each year. She clearly demonstrates and understands that developing and growing future leaders is what makes Chipotle a special company. My favorite part about her journey is that through her financial success at Chipotle, she was able to help her mom retire, which she views as her biggest accomplishment. I could not be prouder to be part of an organization that prioritizes our people and their growth. And the exciting part is that as we look to grow to 7,000 restaurants in North America and expand internationally, we will be adding hundreds of new restaurant leadership roles each year, and we will continue to pursue our goal of promoting over 90% from within. The future is very bright at Chipotle. Now turning to marketing, I have to take a moment to acknowledge our marketing team for their outstanding work over the years and making Chipotle more visible, more relevant, and more loved. Our brand continues to lead and gain momentum in many categories like quality of ingredients, quality of food for the money, and healthy and nutritious. This is a result of a strong marketing strategy and brand campaigns like Behind the Foil, which showcases our Chipotle teams preparing our fresh, delicious food. The campaign is certainly resonating well, and we will continue to evolve it and find new ways to put a spotlight on what differentiates Chipotle, which is our food, our people, our purpose, and our values. Turning to menu innovation, our limited time offers continue to surpass our expectations. Our guests have been craving the return of Smoked Brisket for three years and it's off to a very strong start driving incremental transactions and spend. As we have mentioned in the past given the limited supply of responsibly raised beef it was a huge cross-muscle effort to bring back this fan favorite and we anticipate it will last through the fourth quarter. We also been testing Chipotle Honey Chicken which is our adobo chicken seasoned with savory Mexican spices and finished with a touch of pure honey. Similar to Chicken Al Pastor it is simple to execute in our restaurants and absolutely delicious. This has been one of our most successful tests to date both in early century testing as well as in the broader two market test we are currently running in Nashville and Sacramento. I'm delighted to share that Chipotle Honey Chicken has made its way through the stage gate process and is ready to be rolled out in the future. Finally coming up this week will be our annual boom reader promotion. This year our marketing team found another creative way to lead culture as we collaborated with spirit Halloween and launched a new collection of Chipotle costumes inspired by popular memes on our social channels which is generated some of our highest social engagement this year. Now moving on to our final strategy which is to expand access and convenience both in North America and internationally. In North America, our development team made great progress smoothing the cadence of openings with 185 new restaurant openings year-to-date which compares to 149 at this same time last year. We remain on track to open between 285 and 315 new restaurants this year which will mark another record for us. As we look at 2025, we anticipate opening 315 and 345 new restaurants with at least 80% including at Chipotlane. In Canada, our new restaurant openings continue to be outstanding and in the third quarter we entered another new market with our first restaurant in Edmonton which broke an opening day record for North America. We will surpass 50 restaurants in Canada next month which is a huge milestone. Our unit level economics and returns remain on par with the US and we will continue to accelerate growth in Canada in 2025. Turning to Europe, under the new leadership team we are beginning to see promising results. We have better aligned our culinary menu to the North American standards and we are in the process of fully unlocking the functionalities of our operational tools to better manage labor and food costs. Additionally, similar to our successful strategy in Canada, we are rolling out local and digital marketing initiatives which are building brand awareness and bringing more guests into our restaurants. The recent performance gives us confidence that we can begin to build our restaurant pipeline for the future. And I'm optimistic that Europe will be a sizable growth opportunity for Chipotle over the coming years. Finally, I'm excited to share that our first restaurant in Dubai opened earlier this month. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful and located along the beachside boulevard of Jumeirah Beach. This is the third restaurant we have opened this year with our partner Alshaya Group. All three restaurants are exceeding our expectations and Chipotle is one of the top performing brands in AlShaya's portfolio. This is further strengthening our confidence that Chipotle is responsibly sourced, classically cooked, real ingredients, resonates across geographies. We are targeting to open a second restaurant in Dubai early next year and plan to accelerate growth with Alshaya Group in 2025. In closing, I want to thank our restaurant and support center teams for another great quarter driven by strong transaction growth. I always say that at Chipotle, we are either directly serving our guests or serving someone who is serving our guests. And it's important that as a team we continue to focus on exceptional food, exceptional people, and exceptional throughput. This will drive great execution in our restaurants that will enable us to continue down our very long runway for growth as we expand to 7,000 restaurants in North America and grow internationally. And as we make our way down this path, I strongly believe Chipotle will become a purpose driven, global lifestyle brand. With that, I'll turn it over to Jack. Jack Hartung : Thank you, Scott. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I hand it over to Adam to go through the third quarter financial results, I want to make a few comments about the management transition. While Brian\u2019s departure was not expected, our focus on succession planning at all levels of the organization allowed for this to be a seamless transition with Scott assuming the role as our Interim CEO. We're all very supportive of Scott as his leadership at the company is unparalleled, having led our restaurant teams over the last seven years. And Adam and Jamie were already well prepared to take on their new roles earlier than anticipated so that I could step into my new role as President and Chief Strategy Officer. Also I want to emphasize that the culture and morale at Chipotle has never been stronger. We have so many passionate leaders running our restaurants and at our sports centers that are all connected by our purpose of cultivating a better world. There's positive energy and a real sense of responsibility to keep the momentum going and to continue to execute against our very successful strategy. Finally, I'm committed to my new role and plan to stay on indefinitely to ensure a smooth transition. As you can imagine, having spent 22 years at Chipotle, I love this company. I'm passionate about our purpose and I strongly believe we have a very long growth runway ahead of us as we expand Chipotle in North America and around the world. With that, I'll now turn it over to Adam, our new Chief Financial Officer to go through the results. Adam, congratulations and over to you. Adam Rymer : Thank you, Jack. I'm excited to take on the role of Chief Financial Officer for this great company and I'm happy to be with all of you on my first conference call. With that said, I will turn to our quarterly results. Sales in the third quarter grew 13% year-over-year to reach about $2.8 billion as comp sales grew 6%, driven by over 3% transaction growth. Restaurant level margin of 25.5% decreased about 80 basis points compared to last year. Earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $0.27, representing 17% year-over-year growth. The third quarter benefited from equity awards forfeited by our former CEO and a gain on an investment. These were partially offset by the impairment of a corporate asset and equity awards granted for retention of key executives. Collectively, these positively impacted our earnings per share by $0.01, leading to GAAP earnings per share of $0.28. As Scott mentioned, comps accelerated throughout the quarter, with transaction trends strongest in September as the impact from summer seasonality normalized and we rolled out Smoked Brisket. Looking to Q4 and taking into consideration that the strong transaction trends have continued so far in October, as well as the tougher comparison against Carne asada, we anticipate our transaction comps to modestly accelerate from Q3. As a reminder, we roll off about three points of pricing at mid-October, as the impact of pricing in the fourth quarter will be just over 1% due to the price increase, we took in our California restaurants in April. For the full year, we continue to expect our overall comp to be in the mid to high single digit range. I will now go through the key P&L line items beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 30.6%, an increase of about 90 basis points from last year. The benefit of last year's menu price increase was more than offset by inflation across several items, most notably avocados and dairy, as well as higher usage as we focused on ensuring consistent and generous portions, and the mixed impact from our premium Smoked Brisket LTO. For Q4, we anticipate our cost of sales to be just about 31%, as we have a full quarter of our Smoked Brisket LTO. As we mentioned last quarter, we believe we can offset the 60 basis point portion investment through efficiencies and innovation over the next several quarters. This includes efficiencies we have identified within our supply chain, as well as several in-restaurant initiatives, including the produce slicers that Scott mentioned earlier. While we anticipate some of the benefit to begin in Q4, we don't anticipate a full offset until the second half of 2025. Labor costs for the quarter were 24.9%, about flat to last year, as the benefit from sales leverage offset wage inflation. For Q4, we expect our labor cost to be in the low 25% range due to seasonally lower sales, with wage inflation to remain in the mid-single digit range. As a reminder, about half of the wage inflation is due to the nearly 20% step up in wages in California, from the increase in minimum wage for restaurant companies like ours that took effect in April. Other operating costs for the quarter were 13.8%, a decrease of about 20 basis points from last year. The decrease was primarily driven by sales leverage and a lower delivery mix, partially offset by higher marketing and promo costs. Marketing and promo costs were 2.1% of sales in Q3, and in Q4, we expect marketing costs to step up to the low 3% range. In Q4, other operating costs are expected to be in the low 14% range, as we anticipate higher marketing costs to be partially offset by lower seasonal expenses, like utilities and maintenance and repair. G&A for the quarter was $127 million on a GAAP basis or $149 million on a non-GAAP basis excluding a net $22 million benefit from equity awards forfeited by our former CEO, partially offset by the expense for awards granted for retention of key executives. G&A also includes $126 million in underlying G&A, $25 million related to non-cash stock compensation and a $2 million benefit from a bonus adjustment. Non-cash stock compensation and bonus expense benefited in the quarter from our CEO's departure as well as performance-based adjustments. We expect our underlying G&A to step up to around $130 million in Q4 as we invest in people to support our growth. We anticipate stock comp will be around $28 million in Q4, although this amount could move up or down based on our actual performance. We also expect to recognize around $4 million related to higher bonus accruals and employer taxes associated with shares that best during the quarter and $1 million for costs associated with our field leadership conference in early 2025, bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q4 to around $163 million. Depreciation for the quarter was $84 million or 3% of sales. In Q4, we expect depreciation to step up slightly as we open more restaurants. Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 22.9% for GAAP and 23.8% for non-GAAP. Our effective tax rate benefited from a reduction in nondeductible expenses related to our CEO's departure. For fiscal 2024, we estimate our underlying tax rate will now be in the 24% to 26% range, although it may vary based on discrete items. Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments with no debt. During the quarter, we repurchased $488 million of our stock at an average price of $54.55. In the third quarter, our Board of Directors approved an incremental $900 million in share repurchase authorization. And at the end of the quarter, we had nearly $1.1 billion remaining. To close, I am grateful for Jack's mentorship over the last 15 years and honored to be a part of our leadership team, serving our 125,000 employees in our restaurants and support centers. We will continue to protect the special brand and our unique economic model that allows us to spend more on our real ingredients, yet remain one of the best values in the industry, while also maintaining industry-leading margins. This is a huge competitive advantage and will continue to require a relentless focus on driving an exceptional experience for our restaurant teams and our guests each and every day. And with that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Andrew Charles of TD Cowan. Andrew Charles : Great. Thank you. First off, Adam, Jack, as well as Scott, congrats on your new roles. Last call, you guys were contemplating a price increase in 4Q. I was curious if this strengthened traffic in recent months, along with missing widget labor cost pressures, to help solidify your decision on this. Scott Boatwright : Yes, this is Scott. I'll jump in here. Thanks for the question. We're keeping a really close eye on the consumer, as you can imagine. Also a close eye on this very competitive market that we're in today, given the macros and what's going on with value wars and QSR and fast casual. But also note that we are seeing some modest inflation. I'll let Adam speak to that in the business today. So nothing planned today, but that's not to say we wouldn't look at a pricing action at some point in the future. Adam Rymer : Yes, and to go a little bit further into inflation. So yes, like you said, Andrew, we're kind of seeing low single digit inflation on cost of sales. That's after you peel back a few layers. So one of that's going to be the investment that we made in portions, so roughly that 60 basis points that we mentioned on the call. We believe we can offset that through efficiencies within our supply chain as well as within the back of house of our restaurants. Probably a full offset by the end of next year, so that's not included. Neither is the impact of Brisket, kind of that premium item and what that's doing to cost of sales right now, as well as the avocado comparison. So if you remember about a year ago, avocados were abnormally low. And so once you peel back those layers, you're seeing about a low single digit inflation on cost of sales and then a similar amount on labor. We mentioned mid-single digit on labor, but that includes the FAST Act. We've already taken prices back in April of this year to offset that roughly 20% increase in wages in California. And so the remaining underlying inflation on labor is kind of in that low single digit range. Andrew Charles : Okay, very helpful. And then, Jack or Adam, you guys previously talked about aspirations to ramp to 10% net restaurant growth in 2025. While the guidance for 315 to 345 openings is a strong number, it was a bit light of the aspirations you guys previously laid out. So I was wondering if you could talk through what is factored into the development guidance for \u201825. Scott Boatwright : Hey, this is Scott. I'll jump in here again. I'll let Adam come in behind. I'll tell you we will see year-over-year incremental new restaurant growth in 2025. The percentage will move closer to 10% than we've been in years past. We feel really comfortable about the number today to successfully open that many restaurants with high-quality leaders that we know we can execute and deliver with excellence. We feel really comfortable in the 8% to 10% range. Can we move closer to 10%? Perhaps. Timelines remain pretty consistent at 21 months. And we have a really robust pipeline. We have a lot of confidence in our development team and operations team to deliver great results in the years to come. Operator : And our next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. David Tarantino : Hi, good afternoon. My question's on new unit performance. At least the way we calculate it this quarter, it looked a little lower than it has been in past quarters. So I was wondering if you could explain what you're seeing there and whether there's something unusual in the numbers affecting the calculations of that. Adam Rymer : Yes, I'll start, and it's got definitely jump in. So nothing unusual in this quarter to really call out. We're still seeing productivity kind of in that low 80% range. And so we're still really excited about how our new units are performing. Scott Boatwright : Yes, and the year two ROI is still holding pretty steadily. And we feel really good about the performance of this class of restaurants. David Tarantino : Great, thank you. And then I guess my other question was about the path to get back to the high 20s restaurant margin. I think you've talked about that being something that you would have at this level of average unit volume. So I guess I know you mentioned some efficiency gains or productivity gains you're expecting but I guess as you think forward is there anything you can share with respect to the path to get there in the next few years. Scott Boatwright : David, I'll start again flip it over to Adam, but I think in general we have a lot of confidence in our ability to get back to high 20s. We think the algorithm still holds at $4 million and 30%. There are several initiatives that are in the pipeline today whether it's supply chain initiatives or efficiencies and or technologies like equipment technologies will help us be more efficient at the restaurant level. Adam, is there anything else you would add to that? Adam Rymer : No, I would just say that within the margin algorithm, that 40% flow through on incremental transactions still very much in line. And I know in Q3, it was about an 80 basis point decline year-over-year. But you have to take into account a few different things. One, the portion investment, which again, will offset that 60 basis points through efficiencies. The avocado comparison is another 50 basis points or so. And then there's an add promo timing that added another 20 basis points. So if you take those into consideration, we would have gone from kind of a minus 80 basis points to a positive 50, which would be more in line with the transactions that we drove. So a few unique items in the quarter. Operator : Our next question today comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Sara Senatore : Thank you. I guess a clarification on the comps and then a question on the throughput. So you mentioned that the comparisons, Carne asada comparisons are difficult, but I thought Carne asada was on the menu for all of the fourth quarter of last year. So just trying to understand if you're saying that you would expect traffic trends, which accelerated nicely into October, to somehow be a flow through the rest of the quarter. And whether or not, again, that any of this is seasonality, similar to what we saw in the second quarter where maybe April was very strong, but then some other kind of variability. So I wanted to make sure I was understanding the commentary on the traffic outlook for 4Q and then just a question about throughput. Scott Boatwright : Yes, Sarah, we are seeing acceleration in the business and that's even in the light of what we believe to have been a very successful Carne asada promotion, which we're rolling over at present. As well as, if you recall, we have 3% pricing that is rolling off, rolled off a couple of weeks ago. And so we feel great about the trends and I think it's a combination of an exceptional product offering, great marketing around what makes our brand unique and special as well as operational execution. I'll tell you, Sarah, our ops teams are delivering on a level I have not seen before in my 30-year history. I couldn't be more proud of them. I think all of those things together are driving the performance that we're seeing in the business today. Adam Rymer : Yes, and then I can expand a little bit on throughput. So we saw great progress in the quarter. Like Scott mentioned, expo execution went from like 50% of our restaurants to 60% of our restaurants. So that was a nice step up. And then we saw an increase in Max 15 of about 1.2 entrees in our 15-minute period. And so we believe that, again, the fueling of not only the positive 3.3% transaction, but also that execution that Scott talked about just amazing in our restaurants to help drive that result. Sara Senatore : Right, thank you. That's great color and just on the throughput just one quick question. Is that how you think about the some of the technology of equipment you're rolling out? I mean I know you talked about efficiencies and it seems like it's that'll largely be reinvested into the portion sizing, but would you expect to see a step change in throughput as well or is that again more incremental? Scott Boatwright : I do, Sara, absolutely. One of the challenges that we have in our restaurants is in the mornings our teams are so involved in cutting, slicing, dicing, chopping, and really preparing all the wonderful ingredients to be used throughout the day that oftentimes they fall behind for a host of reasons whether that's a call out or a new team member joining the team that is less talented with a knife. Those challenges are formidable and that oftentimes causes us to not be deployed effectively at peak and not able to drive great throughput. The technologies we're talking about will help enable our teams to deliver great culinary, but also get the process done in time to be deployed effectively and really drive great throughput of the business. Operator : And our next question today comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. David Palmer : Thanks. Good evening. Scott, I actually heard you on CNBC just now, just a half hour ago or so, and you were talking about some of the technology the AI enabled customized marketing that you would imagine happening and some of the bespoke type suggestions or whatnot. I'm trying to imagine what you could have been talking about there. Maybe you can maybe bring that to life for us about maybe what iterations of enhanced digital experiences and what that could mean ultimately to comps. And just to follow up on that throughput question that Sara was asking about, you mentioned something like a 1.2 improvement in entrees per 15 minutes, and we saw that you had driven, looks like your labor hours might have been roughly flat versus the traffic up 3%. Is that the type of relationship that happens from that? I mean, you talked about five more entrees per 15 minutes being the opportunity. Does that mean that you can kind of do this for another, is there a relationship there that we should think about as we model between those two things? Or maybe I'm overthinking that. Thanks. Scott Boatwright : Yes, thanks David. On to the CRM and CDP, I'm sorry, CDP loyalty and personalization I spoke of earlier. And that way, Curt Garner and his team and talked through some of the early stages of what would an AI model look like to really drive greater efficiency with our loyalty members. And we're early innings and we're still experimenting with some really, really unique ideas. He has an extraordinarily talented team that continues to figure out ways to iterate and drive performance in that channel. And so it's really early days, but we think the AI model's sitting on top that's really searching out whether you're a lapsed user, an at-risk user, or an active user within the program. How do we serve up a bespoke experience, a truly bespoke experience, beyond some of the traditional format pitches that you typically get in a loyalty program, but something that's really tailored for the user, not just a checkout for ads, but also a bespoke experience. When you enter the experience, you'll see something tailored for you as an individual based on your needs, your usages over the past or your history. So we think it's a really cool play on how do we continue to drive incremental value within that platform. Adam Rymer : Yes, and then David, I can comment on the labor comments. I mean, outside of normal leverage, as we drive additional transactions, whether that be through throughput or marketing initiatives or really all of the above, labor hours, there's no kind of relationship, I think, other than the leverage that you're talking about. So if I'm understanding that question correctly. David Palmer : Yes, no, and we can, I'll ask about it more offline, but thank you. Scott Boatwright : David, I will add, one of the challenges we face, again, is getting all the work done in the AM and being deployed correctly. So it's the same amount of labor in the building, but someone's taking care of pot companions at the district and someone else is wrapping up prep on onions or peppers or bell peppers or jalapenos and not being deployed. So if we can get all that work done, put away in the right way, in every restaurant consistently every day, we can deploy all those individuals to the guest experience, which is where we'll drive the most value. Operator : And our next question comes from Christine Zhao with Goldman Sachs. Christine Zhao : Thank you. Congrats, Scott, Jack, and Adam. I was wondering if you can share any internal metrics or measures on the impact and returns of these portion size investments. So do you think these investments have been sufficient in protecting the core brand equity? And what do you need to see to kind of move on gradually? I know you mentioned that you won't expect to fully cycle until the second half, but how you see the returns on the investment so far. Thank you. Scott Boatwright : Yes, it's really hard to quantify. Here's what I will tell you is, if you think about one of the core equities of this rolling brand for the last 30 years, it's all been grounded and this idea of high quality, fresh ingredients prepared for classic culinary techniques in variety and abundance and a speed in which you can't get anywhere else, at an extraordinary price point. And so we know that portioning is a core equity of hours in the organization, and we are committed to ensuring that we give the right portion to every guest that walks into the building. We've seen strong improvement, even through our social channels and people about, it's a reverse of what we saw earlier in the year. Around people posting big burritos, big bowls, and really excited about portioning their getting a Chipotle brand. We also see that show up in our brand tracker and other third party sources where value for the money, food for the money, and quality for the money exceed most of our peers in the category. So also internal consumer metrics that we measured through our digital channel and then restaurant experience show portioning positive scores are up 500 points over the spring. So, we know we're making great progress. We know we're delivering value for the consumer, especially in this really tight environment. And we'll continue to lean into that. Operator : And our next question is from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Brian Harbour : Yes, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe just first one. Adam, do you have any kind of thoughts on inflation next year or so far? Do you think low single digit for food and wages can kind of continue? Adam Rymer : Yes, from what we see at this point, we believe that that will continue. Labor has been kind of in that level outside of the FAST Act for quite some time now. So we have no reason to believe that'll change. And then our first initial looks at cost of sales in the next year are still going to be more of the same. But we'll update you guys if that changes in upcoming calls. Brian Harbour : Okay, thanks. Scott, maybe just on some of the new equipment and automation, how fast do you think some of that can be deployed? And I guess just kind of like philosophically, is this something where it's really -- it\u2019s mainly about kind of creating a better experience for employees? Is it something that you think kind of drives better margins over time? Or on the other hand, do you sort of, if it creates efficiencies, do you share that with the customer in the form of kind of lower pricing versus some of your competition over time? How do you kind of manage that over the longer term? Scott Boatwright : Yes, Brian, I'll tell you, we have a number of initiatives in our stage gate process today. Some short range, some mid-range, some long range. A couple of pieces that are in the short range at the stage gate that have moved their way through. The dual-sided plancha which will drive great efficiency and unlock increased capacity, I should say, in the kitchen, and also drive efficiencies as it relates to the labor model. The produce slicer, we feel really good about it, have already talked about that. We also have, we're testing a new dual backfire that will be more efficient as we cook chips daily in season chips in our restaurants. So all of these things will be items that will help the team member experience, drive efficiency, remove some of the mundane repetitive tasks in the restaurant, which will always ladder to a better guest experience. And some of them will have a margin improvement baked into the program. So we feel really good about the long-range items around avocado and Hyphen. Recall these are companies that we've invested in that were building, co-building really bespoke pieces of technology that we know will help us down the road somewhere, but we continue to refine and iterate on how those show up in the restaurant. And so you'll see those items, I think it's important to know, go into restaurants, we'll test and learn, bring it out of the restaurant, refine the piece of equipment, put it back in. But we feel really good about what the value they can bring long term for the organization. Hopefully that answers your question, Brian. Operator : And our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you, two, if I may. The first question is on your investment in Brassica, in the Mediterranean and the Columbus area. Should we read anything in Chipotle, maybe extending itself a little bit more in terms of being a platform company? I mean, was that a one-off type of transaction, or could we expect a series of interesting businesses like that, that could eventually fit within the Food with Integrity broader theme? Scott Boatwright : That was an investment we made from our Chipotle Next fund, and we felt really good about it. So we were, we've been looking around the industry for concepts, emerging concepts that are aligned with our food ethos and how we think food should be eaten that were aligned to our business model and practices that we could co-invest with. Now, keep in mind, this is a passive investment and a minority investment and will not be a distraction on the Chipotle organization. And so we see them as they think about growth down the road. We'll give them some guidance and counsel on development and how they grow, but it won't be the distraction of this organization, and it could be a growth platform somewhere 10, 15 years down the road that adds a layer of growth for the business. John Ivankoe : Okay. Sounds good. Thank you. And secondly, we spent a good amount of time today talking about prep, prep labor, complexity, and to some extent the repetitiveness around it, stores that need to be staffed at 6 or 7 in the morning. I've asked a question before, and sometimes I don't think I've asked it correctly. Is there an opportunity over time to maybe have certain prep stores that are densely clustered within a market that can maybe take care of some prep work for stores that are in their immediate surroundings. I'm not asking for a central kitchen per se, as we would normally define those terms on an industry basis, but maybe one store that takes care of prep for five or 10 stores around it that could make it easier to run all stores within a specific trade area. Is that something that you're considering over time? Scott Boatwright : Hey, it's a great question, and it's something we have looked at in the past. Now, it comes with its own set of complexities and inherent risks, and largely the opportunity is how do we create that experience? We can be consistent with regard to how we prep, but then distributing and keeping that food safe during the distribution process from the central location out to, call it, a spoken hub. It\u2019s just challenging. And when we looked at it a few years back, it was cost prohibitive as well. And so right now, we feel like the working model we have is the best way to Chipotle to deliver our unique experience, but that's not to say we couldn't look at something different down the road. Operator : And our next question comes from Lauren Silberman at Deutsche Bank. Lauren Silberman : Great. Thanks so much. I just wanted to ask about the consumer, some of the behavior you're seeing across different cohorts, the low, middle income, high income consumer, any differences that you're seeing across regions at all? Scott Boatwright : Yes. I'll start, and I'll flip it over to Adam here. We're still seeing strength across all income cohorts, even in this competitive environment, which gives us the belief that we are still delivering extraordinary value for the consumer. You can get all the core equities that I talked about earlier, and the chicken burrito on average is still under $10, which we believe is still a 15% to 30% discount compared to our peer group. And so we'll continue to lead into that as we move forward. Again, all income cohorts, even low income, are showing positive signs of strength. Adam Rymer : Yes. And I would just add, across the board, too, in terms of our regions, I mean, really all performing very, very well. We called out California on the last call, of course, after the FAST Act price increase there. We did see some weakness overall in our sales in California after the FAST Act, but we sell that across the entire industry, so it seemed to be more of a macro based, or really just a reaction to the inflation in restaurants in California. So that has kind of continued on into Q3, but outside of that, it's really been pretty broad based on our strength. Lauren Silberman : Great. Very helpful. And then just a follow up on the 4Q guide, you talked about traffic modestly accelerating, have price rolling off. Are you assuming traffic decelerates as we move through the quarter and just a level set? Are you thinking 4.5% to 5% in terms of the comp guide for the quarter? Thank you. Adam Rymer : Yes, and so like I said earlier, September was kind of a mid-7% comp of which trans were kind of in that low 4% range. That trans comp has continued into October. And at this point our assumption is that will continue into Q4. And then in the prepared comments I talked about how the price impact would be just above 1%. And there'll be a slight mixed drag. So I believe check will be somewhere around 1%. So I think you're thinking about it the right way if you get kind of into that mid-5% range. Operator : And our next question today comes from Chris O\u2019Cull with Stifel. Chris O\u2019Cull: Thank you. First, Scott, I wanted to clarify the level of improvement in the number of entrees per 15 minutes that you believe is ultimately possible after implementing the throughput and issues that are planned for the next six to nine months or so. Scott Boatwright : Yes, I think it's possible for us to get back to where we were in the heyday of Chipotle in the low 30s, and today we're trending around the mid-20s. So you have to include digital in that number. The digital entrees are coming through the digital channel as well, but if you think about just the true business, the in-restaurant experience, that is, we think there's still pretty significant upsides. Chris O\u2019Cull: Okay, and then just one other question. I was hoping you could provide a bit more color on the performance of the Smoked Brisket. In particular, has the repeat usage been as high this time as it was the last time it was promoted? Adam Rymer : Yes, so I'll start, and then, Scott, you can jump in. And so Brisket is performing really well, especially compared to Carne asada. It's kind of in that mid-teens incident in terms of a percent of entrees. It's driving spend. It's driving additional transactions, comping really well over Carne asada. And then in terms of repeat usage, I mean, I know it's driving amazing new customers to the brand, as well as getting people in and increasing their frequency. And then what's beauty, the beauty of all of these LTOs is they come in, they try Brisket, and then we see on the second or third businesses, sometimes they go back to Brisket, sometimes they go to chicken, steak, or other items. So really seeing some great trends there. Scott Boatwright : Yes, it's not often that you find an LTO that you can put in the marketplace that's going to drive check, transactions, and margin. This is one of them. And so we're super excited about the product. We love how it's performing. Operator : And our next question today comes from Brian Bittner in Oppenheimer. Brian Bittner : Hey, thank you. And congratulations to everybody on their new roles. As it relates to margins, specifically the COGS margin line, you saw the deleverage this quarter of about 90 basis points, and obviously that was expected. But can you bridge that deleverage broken down between the actual portion investments that you deployed versus underlying dynamics, like food cost inflation for us, so we can understand bridge little bit better. And I totally understand that a price action doesn't seem necessarily on the table for 4Q, but how do you want us all thinking about the potential base case for pricing as we go into 2025? Because I think that is going to be a debate on investors' minds moving forward. Adam Rymer : Yes. So like I talked about earlier, so within cost of sales, that portion investment of about 60 basis points, that's fully in that cost of sales number. And then the avocado comparison of being about another 50 basis points or so of just it being abnormally low in the prior year is also in there as well. And so once you peel back those two layers and then the fact that Brisket, which like Scott talked about, it drives margin overall. However, it does increase our cost of sales, I think roughly 40 or 50 basis points in a quarter. And so that's another layer that's basically temporary hit to cost of sales. However, because of the price point of Brisket, you leverage on labor and other operating and things like that. And so once you peel back the layers, look at the underlying inflation of cost of sales, labor, and other operating expense, that menu price impact that we would need to offset that and maintain our margins would be probably somewhere in that like 2% to 3% range. Operator : And our next question today comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Sharon Zackfia : Hi, good afternoon. It sounds like things are on a really good path to Alshaya so far. And I'm curious just given what seems to be a good start there, are you thinking about other kind of shortlisted regions that you'd like to find licensees to operate Chipotle? And are you fully committed to continuing to own your locations in France, Germany, and the UK? Scott Boatwright : Yes, thank you. Here's what I'll tell you is we're really pleased with our partnership with Alshaya. And I said on the call, we're one of the best performing brands in Alshaya's portfolio. We plan pretty aggressive growth with Alshaya over the next few years. We will strategically look at other like partners around the globe that we could potentially partner with to expand, whether that's Latin America or APAC or otherwise, those opportunities, I am sure emerge over the coming months. And we'll look at those very closely on what the market entry would look like for us, how we think about those partnerships. We will continue to own our presence in Western Europe as well as North America. We think that's the greatest way to drive value for our brand and for our shareholders. Sharon Zackfia : Thanks for that. And then there's a question on Hyphen. I know it's early days and you've only have it, I think, in one location. But is that helping keeping kind of the aces in their places, having that tool in the restaurant? Scott Boatwright : It is. More importantly, it will allow us to unlock demand in that channel. And so we think, we don't think. We know that the table with one individual, the output is far greater than one or two individuals on the table. And so the goal here is 60% of our entrees are either bowls or salads. And so the table is taking care of all of that lifting, heavy lifting, if you will. And then the operator at the table can focus on burritos and tacos. We think it's a pretty magnificent lift in overall demand. And we're driving improved performance, whether it's plating or accuracy for the consumer. Operator : And our final question today will come from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Danilo Gargiulo : Thank you. And once again, congrats everybody, for your new and expanded roles. Scott, clearly your message has been that of continuity with the strategy at Chipotle. So if your appointment was to become permanent, what would you like to be known for and which opportunities for acceleration of the current strategy do you see more likely for Chipotle? I mean, it sounds like you're more open to international growth as a natural evolution, but maybe there is more areas that you are going deeper on. Thank you. Scott Boatwright : Yes, terrific question. It is my endeavor to keep our organization, this leadership team, and all the 125,000 folks in our field organization clearly focused on our five strategic priorities that have served our brand for the last many years. Sure, there'll be some iteration or modification in the years to come, but we feel very confident those five key strategies will continue to drive extraordinary performance for this organization. It'll also, two other things I think I'd like to point out is I'd like to continue to move our organization to a more connected organization to the consumer through our restaurant teams. And so, I think that's an important note, right. I mean, everyone in the organization, I said this in the prepared remarks, is either serving a Chipotle guest or serving someone who is. And when you have that kind of power and focus in an organization, extraordinary things can happen. And the last thing I'd leave you with is this brand has had extraordinary success here in North America. We have our sites clearly aligned on 7,000 restaurants, but I also want to give an eye towards how do we continue to push Chipotle to be more of an iconic global brand? And so, that's what you'll see probably in the coming years and coming months. And that's probably it. Danilo Gargiulo : Okay, great. And if I may, just double-clicking on the international expansion, given your continued successes in Europe, if you were to borrow from your experience in Canada, how many quarters of the way do you think we are from Chipotle growing units in Europe? And what is still pending before the performance in Europe can really close the full gap versus Canada or Europe? Thank you. Scott Boatwright : Yes, so if you look back at what happened historically when we worked on the turnaround in Canada, it started about six years ago, and of course appointing a new leader in Canada and Anat Davidzon was critical and really the fulcrum to leverage the business in a more full way, whether it's supply chain efficiencies, operational efficiencies or marketing, demand driven marketing. She's done an amazing job in that country getting margins to US, comparable to US margins and we're growing at 25 to 35% in country today. The reason we put Anat in Western Europe is to probably, not probably, to look for a similar outcome and she's already making incredible progress aligning the co-native US standards, getting operational efficiencies and processes in place around cost of labor, cost of food. And so we feel really good about the progress. To put a time to it, I couldn't really give you a timetable. Here's what I'm telling you is we know we could have hundreds of restaurants in the markets in which we operate today and potentially thousands in Western Europe over time. So that's what I leave you with. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to the company for the closing remarks. Scott Boatwright : Thank you. And I just want to say thank you to everyone for joining the call today. And I want to ensure I really believe that I'm incredibly proud of this entire Chipotle family for driving another, what I believe to be, incredible quarter around transaction trends and accelerating momentum. Our culture, brand, and value proposition have never been stronger and we have a lot of exciting initiatives in the pipeline that will continue to grow and strengthen our great company and our brand for many years to come. We look forward to speaking to all of you in our fourth quarter earnings call in February. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. And have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Olsen, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead. Cindy Olsen : Hello, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 earnings call. By now, you should have access to our earnings press release. If not, it may be found on the Investor Relations website at ir.chipotle.com. I will begin by reminding you that certain statements and projections made in this presentation about our future business and financial results constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current business and market expectations, and our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see the risk factors contained in our annual report on Form 10-K and in our Form 10-Qs for a discussion of risks that may cause our actual results to vary from these forward-looking statements. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found via the link included on the presentation page within the Investor Relations section of our website. We will start today's call with prepared remarks from Scott Boatwright, Chief Executive Officer, and Adam Rymer, Chief Financial Officer, after which we will take your questions. Our entire executive leadership team is available during the Q&A session. And with that, I will turn the call over to Scott. Scott Boatwright : Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. I speak on behalf of everyone at Chipotle when I say that we are deeply saddened by the devastation caused by the recent wildfires in Southern California. The safety of our restaurant teams and guests is a top priority. And fortunately, I'm pleased to report that our team members are safe and the impact of our business has been minimal. In response to this tragedy, Chipotle has provided thousands of burritos to firefighters and first responders, committed $1 million in free meals to those impacted, as well as made donations through our Cultivate Foundation to charitable organizations, aiding in the relief efforts. We also featured the American Red Cross in our app to provide our guests a way to donate by rounding up their change. I want to thank our employees and our guests for helping to support the recovery efforts in the affected communities. Now turning to our business update, Chipotle had another outstanding year, delivering strong transaction-driven comps each quarter, expanding margins, opening over 300 restaurants, gaining momentum in key industry-leading brand metrics, making progress on many back-of-house initiatives, and building our footprint internationally. For the fiscal year 2024, sales grew about 15% to reach $11.3 billion, driven by a 7.4% comp, including over 5% transaction growth. Digital sales of $3.9 billion represented 35% of sales. AUVs increased to $3.2 million. Restaurant-level margin was 26.7%, an increase of 50 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $1.12, representing 24% growth over last year. And we opened a record 304 new restaurants, including 257 Chipotle lanes. Our fourth quarter results were also impressive, especially considering that we are lapping the very successful Carne asada limited-time offer from last year. Additionally, we experienced some volatility around the December holidays, which we believe was impacted by the calendar shifts this year. Despite this, we were able to grow transactions by 4% in the quarter, driven by continued improvement in throughput, as well as the successful rollout of Brisket as a limited-time offer. For the fourth quarter, sales grew over 13% to reach $2.8 billion, driven by a 5.4% comp. Digital sales were 34% of sales. Restaurant-level margin was 24.8%, a decline of 60 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.25, representing 19% growth over last year. And we opened 119 restaurants, including 95 Chipotle lanes. Considering our underlying trends, as well as our incremental throughput opportunity and strong marketing plan, we believe we can continue to drive positive transaction comps in 2025 and anticipate annual comps to be in the low- to mid-single-digit range. Adam will provide more details on this in just a few minutes. Now, before I dive into an update on our strategies, I want to take a minute to share a key takeaway from our leadership summit we held in November. An important theme we are prioritizing is to be guest-obsessed. I want to make sure that as we continue to scale Chipotle, everything we do is in service of our guests or those who serve our guests. This will require an understanding and a focus on how each role in the organization matters up to making the experience in our restaurants better every day. A guest-obsessed mindset is crucial to ensuring that we continue to deliver against our five key strategies that help us win today while we grow the future. And these strategies include running successful restaurants with a people accountable culture that provides great food with integrity while delivering exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences, amplifying technology and innovation to drive growth and productivity at our restaurants, support centers, and in our supply chain, making the brand visible, relevant, and loved to acquire new guests and improve overall guest engagement, sustaining world-class people leadership by developing and retaining top talent at every level, and expanding access and convenience by accelerating our restaurant openings in North America and internationally. I will start with our operations and our focus on throughput. One key driver of running successful restaurants is an experienced general manager who understands the importance of throughput and can train and develop the crew to execute the four pillars consistently every day. The good news is our GM turnover continued to improve in 2024 and is among the lowest levels in the company's history. More stability among our GMs results in more stability in our restaurants, and stability coupled with consistent training and reps has been a big driver of the progress we have seen. In 2024, throughput improved by about two entrees in the peak 15-minute period, and we achieved our near-term goal to reach the mid-20s. Our support centers and restaurant leadership teams continue to find ways to improve our ability to execute the four pillars. For example, our weekly throughput reviews conducted across our restaurant support centers help to keep us top of mind and give our restaurant leaders information to provide coaching and feedback to drive improvement as well as celebrate excellence. We also made the decision last quarter to have the manager on duty responsible for the expo position, and this helped to improve the percentage of restaurants with an expo in place to over 60%. While I'm thrilled to see the progress we are making, we still have work to do and throughput remains one of our biggest priorities and opportunities in 2025. One of the important unlocks this year will be our focus on modernizing the back of house to improve the team member experience and the speed and simplicity of prep while maintaining our high culinary standards. This will ensure more restaurants complete prep on time, which will enable better execution of the four pillars during peak periods, and this brings me to amplifying technology. We have several innovative tools that we are testing to improve the prep process. As we mentioned last quarter, we are currently in the middle of rolling out the produce slicers to all restaurants and expect the rollout to be complete by this summer. Fresh chopped produce in our restaurants each day is key to maintaining our high culinary standards. But it's also one of the most time-consuming tasks. The slicer improves the experience for our team members by reducing the time to chop produce and improve the culinary by ensuring consistent cut sizes. As we have mentioned in the past, some of the efficiencies from the produce slicer will help offset the investment we made last year, ensuring generous portion sizes. Over the last several months, we also began a new initiative in a patch of restaurants to better understand the synergistic benefits of installing the produce slicer, the dual-sided plancha, the three-pan rice cooker, and the dual-vat fryer in the same restaurant. As a reminder, the dual-sided plancha cooks the chicken and steak in under half the time it takes on the traditional plancha with the same sear and char and better consistency and juiciness. The new rice cooker eliminates the large rice pots and cooks the rice in the pans that you see on the line, which creates more consistent quality and streamlines the rice cooking process. And the dual-vat fryer doubles the capacity for frying our chips, resulting in better quality and reducing the time it takes while ensuring consistent availability. Based on the initial results, we have decided to roll out all four pieces of equipment to new restaurant openings beginning later this year. And as we gain more data and insights into this initiative, we will determine if and how we roll out more broadly to existing restaurants. This is a great example of how we're beginning to look at our tools and processes and conventions holistically rather than as bolt-on additions. The end goal is to improve the experience for our teams by making tasks easier to execute, more efficient, faster, and more consistent while maintaining our high culinary standards. We are also pursuing long-term innovations through our stage gate process, including avocado, our device that cuts cores and scoops avocados, and our augmented digital make line, both of which are being evaluated on a test basis. While it is early in our learnings on these opportunities, we are making progress and remain optimistic about each of these innovative tools. When we improve the experience for our restaurant teams, it ladders to a better guest experience. Exceptional in-restaurant and digital experiences coupled with our powerful marketing strategy to make the brand more visible, more relevant, and more loved, builds the brand momentum and results in year after year of transaction growth. Our marketing strategy in 2024 was nothing short of exceptional with a strong brand campaign and two very successful limited-time offers, including Chicken Al Pastor and Brisket, both of which surpassed our expectations and drove incremental transactions and spend. This helped to further strengthen our brand as we ended the year leading and gaining momentum in important categories like high-quality ingredients, value for the money, healthy and nutritious, good amount of food for the money, and brand I love. And we have a strong plan for 2025 to keep the momentum going. We started off the year by putting a spotlight on our lifestyle goals and to encourage and reward healthy habits among our guests in North America and Europe, and our second partnership with Strava, the app for active people with over 135 million users in more than 190 countries. With health and wellness top of mind for our guests, this is a great way to show how the Chipotle ingredients can be customized to fit and fuel any dietary restrictions or lifestyle routines. Additionally, I think it's no secret that our Chipotle Honey Chicken Pilot was a success. It was our best performing limited-time offer, both in early sensory testing as well as the broader to market tests, and you'll see it in our restaurants in the near future. We will also continue to reinforce our brand story of high-quality, responsibly sourced ingredients made fresh every day through our behind-the-foil advertising campaign. This campaign, which features our real teams preparing our delicious food, has certainly resonated with our guests who are not just buying our brand, but buying into our brand and our purpose to cultivate a better world. Speaking of our teams, last year was another tremendous year of opportunities and growth with over 23,000 people promoted, of which over 85% of all restaurant management roles were internal promotions. We also promoted three regional Vice Presidents who started as crew members, and now five of our 11 Regional Vice Presidents started as crew and worked their way up to the highest level of operations, managing a region of the country with sales over $1 billion. Collectively, these five RVPs have over 100 years of experience at Chipotle. To be promoted to an RVP, not only did they need to run a successful sub-region, but they also needed to show the ability to develop and grow future leaders, and these five have developed and promoted over 30 Team Directors, nearly 100 Field Leaders, and hundreds of General Managers. These are life-changing careers for the RVPs, as well as the leaders they are developing along the way. I think this is a testament to our leadership development capabilities as an organization, which I couldn't be prouder of. At the end of the day, our business wins when we lean into the growth and development of all Chipotle team members. Finally, moving to expanding access. 2024 was another outstanding year with 304 new restaurant openings, including 257 Chipotle lanes, making it a second year in a row of record openings. We continue to anticipate between 315 and 345 new openings in 2025, with at least 80% including a Chipotle lane. I'm excited to share that we recently surpassed our 1,000th Chipotle lane, and now this drive-through format makes up over 25% of our restaurants. On average, the Chipotle lane takes less than 30 seconds to complete the order pickup process. The added convenience has been incremental, as Chipotle lanes continue to generate better revenues, margins, and returns than non-Chipotle lanes opened at the same time. It can also be seen in the mix of business as Chipotle lanes have a larger pickup mix, mostly offset by a lower delivery mix. Shifting to outside the U.S., we now have 85 international restaurants. Including 55 in Canada, 27 in Europe, and three in the Middle East. As we mentioned last quarter, we're proving that Chipotle resonates across geographies, and we will accelerate growth in Canada and the Middle East in 2025. We will also continue to make progress on proving out the economic model in Europe and begin to build a pipeline for growth. To conclude, 2024 was another year of milestones, including growing transactions over 5% and surpassing $3.2 million in AUV. Reaching 1,000 Chipotle lanes, opening our first restaurants in the Middle East, and making tremendous progress in Europe. I want to thank our 130,000 employees for your hard work last year. The amount of talent and passion we have is more than most businesses could ever hope for. I don't take that for granted, and I'm proud to be a part of this great organization that prioritizes our people and their growth. And we continue to have so much growth in front of us as we aim to reach 7,000 restaurants in North America, grow our AUVs beyond $4 million, expand margins, and make progress toward becoming a global iconic brand. This will require exceptional people, exceptional food, and exceptional throughput, and a commitment to being guest-obsessed. I'm confident that we have the right team to achieve these ambitious goals, and that the best is yet to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Adam. Adam Rymer : Thanks, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Sales in the fourth quarter grew over 13% year-over-year to reach $2.8 billion, as comp sales grew 5.4%, driven by 4% transaction growth. Our comp included a negative 20 basis point true-up related to our loyalty program. As a reminder, in Q4 of each year, we reevaluate the estimated breakage for loyalty points that will expire, and this year we decreased our estimate due to higher member engagement. Restaurant-level margin of 24.8% declined about 60 basis points compared to last year. Earnings per share was $0.24 cents on a GAAP basis and $0.25 on a non-GAAP basis, adjusted for unusual items, representing 19% year-over-year growth. During the quarter, transaction comps were positive in all months, driven by the launch of Brisket and continued improvement in throughput. As Scott mentioned, we experienced softer trends around the holidays in late December, which we believe was due to Christmas and New Year's falling in the middle of each week. Comps have been volatile so far in 2025, with weather having a larger impact on our sales than what we experienced last year. While we believe underlying transaction trends are healthy and we have a strong plan for the year, we do compare against progressively tougher comps in the first half of the year, and therefore are guiding to a low- to mid-single-digit comp for the full year. There are also a couple of factors to keep in mind when you think about the full year. In the second quarter, we will be rolling off about 90 basis points of pricing in April when we lap the pricing we took last year in California to offset the step-up in wages. And Easter will fall back into the second quarter this year, which will negatively impact Q2 comps by about 100 basis points, with no net benefit in the first quarter because of leap day in the prior year. I will now go through the key P&L line items, beginning with cost of sales. Cost of sales in the quarter were 30.4%, an increase of about 70 basis points from last year. The benefit of our menu price increase was more than offset by higher usage, as we focused on ensuring consistent and generous portions, as well as the mix impact from our premium smoked brisket LTO and inflation across several items, most notably avocados and dairy. Relative to our guidance, avocados were favorable, as the year-over-year step-up was less than we anticipated. For Q1, we expect our cost of sales to be in the high 29% range, as pricing leverage and the benefit from brisket ramping down will be partially offset by higher costs across several items, most notably avocados and chicken. Our guidance does not include the impact of the new tariffs on items imported from Mexico, Canada, and China. We source about 2% of our sales from Mexico, which includes avocados, tomatoes, limes, and peppers, and less than 0.5% of our sales from Canada and China. If the recently announced tariffs go into full effect, it would have an ongoing impact of about 60 basis points on our cost of sales. Also, we remain confident that we can offset the 60-basis point portion investment we made in 2024. Recently, we have started to see the impact ease slightly, as we expected, and we will offset the remainder through efficiencies we have identified within our supply chain, as well as several in-restaurant initiatives, including the produce slicers. While we expect to realize some of the benefit in the first half of the year, we don't anticipate a full offset until the second half of 2025. Finally, underlying cost of sales inflation is expected to be in the low single-digit range for the first quarter and for the full year, which excludes the normalization of avocado prices, the mixed impact from LTOs, the portion investment, and any impact from tariffs. Labor costs for the quarter were 25.2%, an increase of about 20 basis points from last year, as the benefit from sales leverage was offset by wage inflation. For Q1, we expect our labor costs to be in the high 24% range, with wage inflation in the mid single-digit range. We anticipate wage inflation will step down to the low single-digit range in Q2 and for the remainder of the year, when we lap the nearly 20% step-up in wages in California that went into effect in April of last year. Other operating costs for the quarter were 14.5%, a decrease of about 20 basis points from last year. The decrease was driven by sales leverage and a lower delivery mix, partially offset by a true-up in insurance reserves. Marketing and promo costs were 3% of sales in Q4, a decrease of about 10 basis points from last year. In Q1, we expect marketing costs to be in the low 3% range, with the full year to come in the mid 2% range. In Q1, other operating costs are expected to be in the low 14% range. G&A for the quarter was $191 million on a GAAP basis or $175 million on a non-GAAP basis, excluding about $12 million related to equity awards granted for retention of key executives and a $4 million increase in legal reserves. G&A also included $133 million in underlying G&A, $32 million related to non-cash stock compensation, $8 million related to higher bonus accruals and payroll taxes on equity vesting and exercises, and $2 million related to our upcoming field leadership conference, which is scheduled in Q1 for this year. We expect our underlying G&A to be around $135 million in Q1, and we'll step up each quarter as we make investments in people and technology to support ongoing growth. We anticipate first quarter G&A will also include around $33 million in stock-based compensation, although this amount could move up or down based off our actual performance and is subject to the final 2025 grants, which are issued in Q1, around $8 million related to employer taxes associated with shares that vest during the quarter, and $3 million for costs associated with our biannual field leadership conference in March, bringing our anticipated total G&A in Q1 to around $179 million. Depreciation for the quarter was $84 million, or 2.9% of sales. For 2025, we expect it to remain around 3% of sales. Our effective tax rate for Q4 was 24.4% for GAAP and 24.6% for non-GAAP, and benefited from a reduction in non-deductible expenses. For 2025, we estimate our underlying effective tax rate will be in the 25% to 27% range, though it may vary based on discrete items. Our balance sheet remained strong, and we ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in cash, restricted cash and investments, and no debt. During the fourth quarter, we purchased $331 million of our stock at an average price of $59.83. For the full year, we purchased nearly $1 billion at an average price of $57.21 and going forward, we will continue to opportunistically purchase our stock. During the quarter, the Board authorized an additional $300 million to our share purchase authorization, and at the end of the quarter, we have just over $1 billion remaining. To close, I want to thank our 130,000 employees for all your hard work and dedication in delivering an exceptional experience for our guests each and every day. This powers our strong economic model that we continue to protect and grow and allows us to invest back into Chipotle by growing our footprint and furthering our purpose of cultivating a better world. We have a strong plan for 2025, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you in the coming quarters. And with that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's first question comes from Sara Senatore with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Sara Senatore : Just a quick housekeeping and then a question about the food line. So just on the housekeeping, you talked about positive transactions in 2025, so I think you mentioned 90 basis points of price rolling off. If you don't take any additional price, what does that look like for the full year? I think you would still have some. And then the question about food costs is better than we expected, given all the headwinds you highlighted in terms of inflation and portion investments. I guess to the extent that it was better than you thought, what was the impact? Was it the pricing? Was it benefits from supply chain earlier than you expected? And have you contemplated tariffs as you think about it going forward? Thanks. Adam Rymer : Thanks, Sara. So on your first question, we believe pricing will be somewhere around 2% in 2025, and so that assumes no additional price. Because if you think about it, we just took about 2% in December. That will carry through December of this year. And then we roll off the roughly 1% national impact from the Fast Act pricing in April. So that comes to be around 2% for the full year. And then on your second question, you're right. We came in a little bit better than we guided in Q4 on cost of sales, and that was mostly because the step-up in avocado prices was a little bit less than we anticipated. It's still happening. It just is more of a timing issue. Scott Boatwright : Sorry, this is Scott. Sara, did you have a question around tariffs? Sara Senatore : Yes, just anything. I know it's obviously in flux, but to the extent that avocados have been a swing factor, if you wouldn't mind touching on that. Thank you. Scott Boatwright : Yes. I'll take this one if you don't mind, Sara. So our supply chain team has done a remarkable job over the last couple of years with vendor diversification and moving some country of origins out of Mexico proper. Today we source from both Colombia, Peru, as well as the Dominican Republic. Only about 50% of our avocado supply today is coming out of Mexico. And I think we said earlier in the prepared remarks, it's about a 60 basis points impact if it is something that sustains for the year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead. David Tarantino : My question is on the comps guidance for the year. I think, Adam, you mentioned a few issues related to the first half. I was just hoping that maybe you could elaborate on how you're thinking the comp trajectory could play out as the year goes on. And I have a follow-up. Adam Rymer : Thanks, David. I'll start talking about really January. So if you look at January from a transactions comp standpoint, we ran about a negative 2, and that included a pretty sizable impact from weather as well as the calendar shift, which kind of had, people going back to work and to school a little bit later with the New Year's Day falling in the middle of the week, and then a very small impact from the wildfires in L.A. All of that was about a 400 basis point impact on our comps in January. And so the underlying trend there is closer to about a plus 2. And so if you push that plus 2 forward for the rest of Q1, we believe that Q1 will come somewhere around flattish on comps. And the reason for that is really when you're looking at February, we're going to be comping over a really successful braised beef barbacoa campaign that we did last year. And that one, the amazing thing about that is we really saw a nice uplift not only in transactions but also in mix that caused a really nice lift in check, a lot of that sustained. And so we don't believe it will hit quite the same way this year because of how much of it sustained. So that's going to be a bit of a tougher comp as well as the second iteration of Chicken Al Pastor hitting in March. It was really pent up demand from the first time that it was in restaurants. And so when that going up as much as it did, that's going to be a really tough, tough comp going into March. And then Easter is also kind of a delay. And so Easter, being a few weeks later is going to cause a little bit of a loss in sales in the sense of Easter tends to really spring our burrito season or beginning of kind of that spring step-ups that we see. So the fact that that's happening several weeks later makes us believe that all of those things will lead to kind of a flat transaction comp in the first quarter. And then when you go into the second quarter, really strong comps from the year before. So I think that'll be kind of a low point for us in terms of the comparison for the full year. And then we'll step up in Q3 and Q4 from there to get to that low to mid-single digit guide that we have for the full year. Scott Boatwright : I just want to say, David, I apologize. I think Adam said that, the comp would be flat for the quarter. He meant that transactions [indiscernible]. I want to make sure we cleared that up. David Tarantino : Yes. Thanks for that clarification. I guess, are you assuming a big lift from, you mentioned honey chicken would be coming pretty soon. Is that embedded in your guidance? Are you assuming something similar out of honey chicken, as you thought it Chicken Al Pastor? I guess, how should we think about potentially the upcoming launch of that, that you signaled? Scott Boatwright : Yes. Hi, David, Scott here. That is not included in the guidance that Adam just gave you. And we typically launch our LTOs around mid to late March. We do intend to launch a product around that timeframe. And we're excited about the marketing calendar for the year. I think Chris and team have done a really nice job of setting up the year to drive positive transactions. And we're excited about the LTO we're going to launch in the spring. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Palmer at Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : As a follow-up on that commentary about the LTO with honey chicken, lapping chicken al pastor, to some degree, I feel like we all focus on these LTOs as the big driver for comps. It's obviously easy for us to focus on these innovations. But when you think about real comp drivers for the year, I'm wondering what other things you're really thinking about that will give you momentum as you go through the year. You mentioned throughput. Do you think that will be as much of a lift this year or maybe even bigger than last year? And maybe you're contemplating certain things that you can do seasonally, maybe personalized marketing initiatives or anything beyond these LTOs that you might be thinking about in terms of a sales driver. Thank you. Scott Boatwright : Yes, David, you've heard us talk about this idea of having a flywheel really generating outsized performance and the flywheel being inclusive of great operations, great marketing, and a great digital strategy. I'll start with operations. I'll tell you, our ops teams have never been on better footing as they stand today with regard to staffing, app model, the best retention numbers we have experienced in my years with the brand. Culture is really strong in the organization today. And we're set up for what could be an extraordinary year around this idea of improving this guest experience, the total guest experience. We spent a lot of time over the past many years really getting to the heart of extraordinary culinary. Speed down the line has been a key focus. There's more work to do there, David. And I think the unlock for step change improvement there is grounded in this idea of what I'm talking about as modernization of the back of house at Chipotle, which drives efficiency, allows us to be better prepared for the peak period at lunch and dinner, and also allows us to continue to scale this great brand as we endeavor to go to 7,000 restaurants in North America alone. That said, operationally, I feel like we've never been on better footing. I will continue to lean into, obviously, the throughput strategies we've deployed in the past and a couple of new ideas we have for this year. As it relates to the marketing calendar, as I said earlier, Chris and team have come forward with a marketing plan that is really extraordinary and probably the best plan we've seen in the branches I've been here as well. We have incremental spend, as you know, year-over-year. We have more linear TV this year than last. The LTOs this year are going to be really strong. We have some new things we're going to test and learn on as it relates to summer months. More on that at a later date. And then with regard to digital, the team is really working on this idea of leaning into the AI assistant to help with customer journeys. I'll give you an example of what that looks like. It's a new pre-defection journey. When the model detects that a customer's behavior is changing in a particular way that would signal a propensity for churn, we will take them on a new journey with personalized extras and offers to encourage them to reengage. And so I think those things are going to drive meaningful difference within the digital channel. And so that total flywheel gives me a lot of confidence this year that we'll have positive transactions and continue to move the business forward. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Lauren Sullivan with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Lauren Silberman : I wanted to follow up on the traffic commentary. Underlying traffic in January up to, it's a [de-sell] [ph] from what you've been seeing in recent quarters, as you assess the underlying business and understand there's a lot of noise, any more color on what you're seeing from the consumer, any shifts that you're seeing across cohorts, just trying to understand how we go from, I guess, what underlying is plus two, but we're at a down two to back up to positive as we move through the year. Thank you. Adam Rymer : Yes, no, nothing really to report from an income cohort standpoint. I mean, they're all contributing to the comp very nicely, and we saw this throughout Q4, and that really hasn't changed going into January. So nothing to report on that side. And I would just say, as we turn the year and we look at what we're comping over last year, I mean, keep in mind that we're comping over a roughly, what, 5.3% trans comp from the year before. And so I think that's probably what you're seeing with some of that step down in terms of the absolute comp. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please go ahead. Dennis Geiger : Great. Thanks, guys. Another one on the comp outlook, if I could, sort of bigger picture, cutting through some of the weather noise, the comparisons. Do you guys generally look at the business a little bit longer term as sort of mid-single digit from a same-store sales algorithm perspective, pick your price to understand the positive traffic? Is that still the right way to think about the business longer term or kind of underlying trajectory? Thank you. Scott Boatwright : Yes, I'll start, and I'll flip it over to Adam. Yes, absolutely. Mid-single digits is right where we should be as an organization. We'll continue to put forward strategies that will keep us on that pace in the years to come. I think we've demonstrated over the past many years that we can continue to push forward long-standing, durable earnings and have done a remarkable job with it over the past many years. This year, unfortunately, is off to a rough start, and some of that stuff is largely out of our control. But we have, what we believe to be a great plan for the year, and guiding the low to mid makes more sense to us, based on where we sit today. Hence the guidance. But, Adam, anything you would add to that? Adam Rymer : No, that's perfect. Thanks, Scott. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Christine Zhao with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Christine Zhao : So, Adam, you still seem to be pretty cautious about taking additional pricing this year. I just want to understand whether this is a reflection of consumer price sensitivity rising or competitive pressure on value, or do you think there would still be a runway for incremental pricing if it becomes necessary throughout the year? And, secondly, just also if you had any thoughts on the mixed component this year. Thank you. Adam Rymer : Sure. So when it comes to pricing, we are comfortable with the level of pricing we're running right now for the inflation that we're seeing in the business. Because, as you know, we like to utilize price only to offset inflation, and we want to grow our margins through incremental transactions. And so if there were something that came up throughout the year that would be a permanent hit to the business in the form of inflation, we would consider taking price. But at this point, we feel we're well covered based off of what we're projecting. And then your question about mix. So the mixed drag in Q4 was about 70 basis points. Keep in mind 20 basis points of that is related to the loyalty adjustment that we took, which was a multi-period adjustment. So it's really, outside of that, the underlying mixed drag was about 50 basis points. And when you're looking at that a little bit closer, it's still driven by a decline in group size. And a big component of that decline in group size that we saw in Q4 really happened in those last couple of weeks of December, as it relates to that calendar shift. And then we're continuing it. And there was also a benefit. So when you think about the offset or sorry, the offset to that group size decline, benefits really came from brisket being a premium priced item, especially compared to Carne asada in the year before. And then I'm happy to report we're continuing to see strength in size. And this is coming from queso. This is coming from extra meat and chips. You probably remember us talking about this for several quarters in a row now. And so that did not change in the fourth quarter. And so those are the main components of that mix. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John Ivankoe : The question is on the labor market for you, and obviously the entire industry. As we went through the end of '24 and into early '25, wage rates have actually been fairly cooperative, maybe outside of California, but fairly cooperative. And turnover levels across the industry have been fairly low relative to historic averages. So can you comment, I guess, so why you think that may have happened, at this point in the economy and are you looking for any kind of signs of change? Maybe there's some certain pockets of change of either strengthening or weakening, in the labor market and various points of the country that maybe you're paying attention to that could potentially be a forward indicator. Thank you. Scott Boatwright : It's a great question. And one, it's hard to answer as you think about why, why all of a sudden retention across the industry has improved. I think ours is probably improved at a quicker rate than many others in the industry. And I attribute that largely to our, what I believe to be best in class wages, best in class benefits, and a great culture. And so, as I said earlier, we're at all time highs on staffing as a brand today, as we sit here, we've never been stronger and retention has never been lower. I attribute that success to our operations leadership out in the field, really doing a remarkable job, creating the right experiences, the right environment that people feel heard, and that they are able to continue to develop and grow and hit their long-term career goals for. As it relates to our peer group, I really can't speak to what's happening there. Is there a canary in the coal mine? I haven't seen one. I think we still continue to see strength in the brand, even in the face of extraordinary value wars and value wars, meaning value as a price point with some of the big QSR players, we continue to take share consistently throughout the year, throughout 2024. We continue to see that trend move forward as well. I think that's built on the fact that we create extraordinary value and keep, we're still a 30% discount on average to our peer group, and the consumer still sees value at Chipotle as benefit over price. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Charles at TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Andrew Charles : Two questions for me. Scott, in light of the external environment that's presenting some challenges to start the year, can you talk about the decision to keep March at the time to launch this upcoming chicken promotion when it possibly could have been accelerated to help make up for some of the shortfall the external environment caused to start the year? Scott Boatwright : Yes. We considered that, absolutely thought about it, you know, toward the end of last year. Can you pull that up? Can you make it, pull it forward? To be quite frank, there were two things that went into the decision. Number one is we had a lot of confidence in Braised Beef Barbacoa, even the second time through, we think will be a meaningful launch in February. We really want to target that March timeframe as it relates to linear TV specifically, because we know that our reach and frequency is much stronger in that March, April timeframe. And so it's kind of, it's fishing when the fish are biting, if you will, and putting all of our marbles in one hat. Hopefully that's helpful. Andrew Charles : Okay. Yep. That's great clarity. Thanks. And then my second question was around, I think in the past you talked about the addition of the expedited position, helps drive around five incremental transactions during that peak 15-minute window. So I'm curious, what is the gaining factor to getting that staffing of that position from 60% to closer to a 100%? Scott Boatwright : Yes. Believe me, it's something we continue to lean into every single day. I think there are restaurants today that are challenged with getting all the prep items done prior to peak getting breaks deployed so that we are set and ready for peak rush. Oftentimes what we find when we don't have the expo in position, there are people that are out of position, either on breaks at the dish sink, washing the enormous amount of wares we use on a given day or still involved in prep activity. We fervently believe that the back of house innovation, the equipment that we are leaning into through our stage gate process will help us drive greater efficiency at the AM morning prep cycle. That'll allow us to hit those targets more consistently as an organization and create a step change and improvement in throughput. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Danilo Gargiulo : I actually have two questions on potential future unlocks. The first one is if you're looking at international markets, I mean with nearly one year of new leadership team in the U.K., what are now the restaurant level margins in their region and how have they improved over time? And maybe, Scott, what other initiatives are you expecting to close the gap on margins versus the U.S.? Scott Boatwright : Hi Dino. Thanks for the question. I'll tell you they've improved measurably so much so that we have decided to go ahead and start looking at site development in specific areas of Western Europe to begin to build the pipeline to grow again. And so we have a lot of confidence in the team. We have confidence in the progress. They continue to make month-over-month progress. And we know that we have, we can drive or create a viable business in the Western Europe markets we operate in today with hundreds of restaurants and potentially thousands of restaurants in other markets, adjacent markets that we can bring in. Danilo Gargiulo : Thank you. And then, another source of opportunity for you is probably the Chipotle lane. And you mentioned that you're still seeing a lot of success in this Chipotle lane, generating higher sales, higher margins. What is your aspirational opportunity to maybe retrofit the stores with more Chipotle lanes given that they've been a success? Scott Boatwright : Yes. So we take a hard look at those, Dino. So the legacy restaurants, we take a hard look at which ones where it makes sense to convert, where we can do it and still see a nice return on the investment. And we will make those strategic decisions throughout the year on which ones we do convert. It's just a hard decision. You've got to understand, how much lease term do I have? Do I have space on the lot? Will the traffic flow work? Will permitting allow it? Obviously so many variables that go into that decision. But where we can, Dino, we will make the investment because we know there's a return. Operator : And our next question comes from Jon Tower at Citi. Please go ahead. Jon Tower : Hopefully you can hear me okay. Scott Boatwright : Yes. Jon Tower : Great. Awesome. Maybe first on unit growth, you've got another year here in '24 where you hit the effectively smack dab in the middle of your guidance range. And I'm just curious if you can offer any insights to what might prevent you from getting to that higher end of the range in fiscal '25. Are you still dealing with local government, permitting issues as kind of a governor there? Scott Boatwright : Jon, some of it's permitting. We're going to hit somewhere in the 9% to 9.5% range this year. And we'll continue to drive the team as it relates to performance for SARs development. Those are the site acceptance requests for new restaurants, obviously 21 months out. And so we feel like the pipeline for '25 was really strong. We'll continue to grow that pipeline and ensure that we have a really successful '26 and hopefully get closer to that 10% mark. But as I said on the last earnings call, we feel really comfortable and confident that we can grow this business in that 8% to 10% range and continue to drive what we believe to be best in class return on investment. Jon Tower : Okay. Maybe switching gears to the marketing front. This will be another year or '24 was another year where your marketing spend as a percentage sales is, is roughly in that 2.5% range. I think you're speaking to a similar level in '25. And when looking back, historically you guys had been in that 3% range and I'm just curious. I know the dollars have grown, but why kind of take that percentage down rather than keep it there and maybe hit different mediums or use it in a different manner? Adam Rymer : Yes. I mean, what you're seeing with that, and we guided for the full year, somewhere in that mid 2% range, what you're seeing there is we're asking for some leverage over the last several years, especially during COVID when we took some outsized price increases to offset inflation and labor and some of the other areas. And so we didn't feel like that should be passed all the way down on the marketing side. And so that's why we're showing a little bit of leverage compared to that historically. However, it is still like, did a very big step up year-over-year, something around 8%, 8.5%. But it's something that we can continue to pull that lever. So if there's good areas that we can invest in, that we think we can get a good return, we'll absolutely pull that lever when those opportunities come up. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Harbour with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Brian Harbour : Yes, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. How would you sort of contextualize the performance of brisket this time relative to, the past iteration of that and other LTOs. And was there anything different just about timing? Like, for example, was it sort of a stronger start, and did it trail off at the end or was it pretty strong throughout? Adam Rymer : Yes. I'll start and then Scott, feel free to add it. And so we felt like, brisket, this was the first time they'd been back in quite some time because as you know, it's a very difficult item to procure. And especially for us to last several months in the amount of restaurants that we have and things like that. And we were very, very excited about the performance. It hit really high in terms of transactions, as well as those that are switching, from all, all across proteins, not just, steak and barbacoa, but also chicken as well. And so it performed really, really well at the onset and then continued through the end of the year and into January. So we're happy with the fact that a lot of our existing customers switched over to brisket. It drove a lot of new customers to the brand. And that it sustained really nicely. And so we're really happy with the results of brisket as well as the hype because like, as you know, it took a couple of years to get it back into our restaurants. And I think that built up some of that hype. Scott Boatwright : Yes. I would tell you it's an extraordinary product and hopefully the folks on the call have tried it many times throughout the promotional window. I know I probably ate it once a week throughout the entire season. The teams in the restaurant did a really remarkable job delivering that experience with excellence this time around and the consumers voted with their wallets and the incidents remained strong throughout the entire promotion. It's something we would probably do annually, maybe even permanently if you could find adequate supply, but unfortunately that's not the case. So hopefully we can bring it back as a future LTO as an arrow in the quiver in the years to come, but we'll see. Brian Harbour : Okay, great. Thanks. Just on the equipment discussion. So the produce slicer, I guess my question there was, once you roll that out, does that actually change? I knew you could redeploy some of that labor, but does it actually sort of like change labor hours needed? If people can, I don't know, show up an hour later, for example. And then, Scott, you talked about sort of that new suite of equipment that you're, you're testing, but if you were to sort of put that in more existing locations or try to roll that out faster, is there, you know, any obstacle to doing so besides just kind of securing supply of equipment? Scott Boatwright : Yes. So the produce slicer will save labor. We plan to redeploy some of that labor and capture part of the labor. How much we have is, is undecided at present. The other piece of equipment are also pieces of equipment that will drive efficiency in the restaurant, better team member experience, better culinary, but it'll also allow us to redeploy or take labor as margin as well. One of those examples is the dual vat fryer. Dual vat fryer, obviously, allows us to cook chips and less than half the time it takes today, freeing up that individual to do other tasks in the restaurant to better prepare for throughput. The dual sided plancha, we've talked about quite a bit over the years. We think it's a better product coming off the plancha, reduces the complexity of one of the most complex jobs at Chipotle today, which is the grill operation. And the rice cooker is far more efficient for the team members, gets them away from those big pans of rice that are just hard to work with and hard to mix and makes that easy, that process much more efficient. Those four pieces of equipment will go into all new restaurant openings at the back end of this year, and will be a part of the new restaurant opening package. We are looking to retrofit a handful of restaurants today. We're calling the high efficiency equipment package. We'll walk that through stage gate and if successful, we're seeing the returns we were looking for. Then we'll do, we'll work through how we retrofit the existing fleet of restaurants today. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Sharon Zackfia with William Blair. Please go ahead. Sharon Zackfia : I guess there are a lot of moving parts and restaurant level margin this year. And I just wanted to maybe touch on your thoughts on full year restaurant level margin and your ability to spend that. It feels like it might be a tale of two halves where down in the first half, maybe up in the back half. I'm wondering if that's correct. And then secondarily, in terms of the opportunities to mitigate those portion investments, is there any opportunity to accelerate the harvesting of those efficiencies? Thanks. Adam Rymer : Yes. Hi, Sharon. So you're right in the sense of, I think it is kind of a first half second half type of story. And a lot of that has to do with the portion investment and the fact that we believe that we can offset that investment in the second half of the year. And so that'll cause a little bit of pressure on the first half and then a little bit of relief in the second half. But in general, as you're looking at it from, you know, 10,000 feet, our goal this year is to drive positive transactions and flow that through to where we would see incremental restaurant level margin. So it's really highly dependent on our ability to drive transactions and our ability to flow that through. But that's the ultimate goal. And then in terms of your second question, I believe it was the offset on the portion investment. Is that correct? And the details around that? Sharon Zackfia : Yes. Thanks. Adam Rymer : Yes. And so with that portion investment, you'll notice in the prepared comments, I talked about how a little bit of that 60 basis points is starting to come back, especially through some of our teams and outlier management. That's going to be basis points, at most, maybe 10 basis points. So that'll leave about 50 basis points left in that investment. And we believe that the produce slicers that Scott just talked about will offset a little less than call it half of that. And then you'll get the rest of it a little more than half some from some efficiencies that we've already identified within the supply chain that we're going to start to chip away at here in Q1 and in Q2. And so we'll slowly start to offset that investment. But until those produce slicers come in, you won't see that full offset until the second half of next year. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Co. Please go ahead. Brian Bittner : All my questions have been answered. So I'll just zoom out for you, Scott. you were named permanent CEO in November. And I know on the last call you talked a lot about how the strategy isn't changing. And I think that makes a lot of sense. But now that you're taking on the permanent role of CEO, are there any differences between you and Brian and how you look at the business that's maybe worth pointing out on this call? Or perhaps maybe there's opportunities where you see you could lean in more. I mean, I think it's anticipated that everything stays the same for the most part, but just wanted to give you the opportunity to suggest any differences. Scott Boatwright : I really appreciate that. I don't know there are a ton of differences. Here's what I would tell you is there are three core things that we have the organization focused on for the year. And I talked about this differently in the last earnings call when I talked about a more connected organization. And what I endeavor to do in this leadership endeavors to do is be more connected to the guest and around this idea of guest obsession. And if you're in a support center role, your guests are the folks out in the field that are doing the work in our restaurants every day. And I need us to obsess over those individuals. At the restaurant level, we have to do a better job of creating a better experience consistently for all guests that come into our restaurants, whether that's clean dining rooms, smiles down the line or better guest recovery. We have opportunity there. We're really strong with culinary today. We're really strong with speed down the line. We have best in class team members in every single restaurant. We can do a better job of creating a really unique experience as it relates to guest obsession. That's number one. Number two, I keep talking about this, it's a critical one, is modernization of the back of house. And I own that one because I've been reluctant for many, many years as a Chief Operating Officer to make any wholesale changes to how we deliver the experience. And it's taken me a long time to get comfortable with equipment innovations that will come into the back of house and modify, if you will, the knife and cutting board process that we have today. I've gotten comfortable because we still need the knife and cutting boards and we create a better consistent cut size, which ladders to a better consistent recipe and taste profile. So if we can generate that experience and be more efficient and have better culinary, I am all in. So we are bought into this idea of modernization of back of house. And the last thing is around this idea of growth. And growth, not only in organic growth, new restaurant growth, growth around the globe, if you will, as we move into other countries like the Middle East. We're taking a look at a couple of other partnerships as we speak today around the world. But growth with people and growth in from our restaurants all the way up to this executive team. How do we think about development? How do we continue to lean in on growth for individuals that have career aspirations? We want people to start here, stay here, and know they'll hit their career goals and life journeys right here at Chipotle. So those are the three things that I continue to pound the drum on. This team is a line behind. But it's still grounded in the five key strategies that remain unchanged. Operator : Thank you. And our final question today comes from Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Zach Fadem : So wanted to follow up on the restaurant level margins. As we've been looking at about 20% incremental flow through in the second half of the year, it seems like we should expect similar in the first half of the year. But as the portion investment eases, maybe you have some equipment productivity, a return to, I guess, reaccelerating comps. Is the high 30% to low 40% incremental margins still the right way to think about this business? Or are there any other puts and takes we should keep in mind? Adam Rymer : No, that 40% flow through is still very much intact. And you're right on the pieces as to why the second half of the year, it's been closer to call it 20% because of the portion investment. And then as we start to chip away at that in the first half of this year, like you said, as well as start to drive transaction comps, we'll climb back to that, I believe for the second half of the year. So you've got the pieces spot on. Zach Fadem : Perfect. And then, Scott, you just mentioned, the potential to explore additional partnerships around the world. So I guess first question is, I presume the relationship with Alshaya is going well and second, in any additional color on regions that you might be interested in down the road. Scott Boatwright : I's our belief that Chipotle works in all geographies around the globe. We think we have an extraordinary product. And it's hard to argue that rice, beans and chicken doesn't work around the globe. So we have a lot of confidence in our strategy. The partnership with Alshaya, I'll talk about first is going really, really well. And so we have three restaurants open, two in Kuwait, one in Dubai. We have one additional restaurant in Dubai opening very soon. We're happy. Mohammed Alshaya is really happy with the relationship, and we'll continue to expand pretty aggressively with the Alshaya Group here in 2025. As we think about other partnerships around the globe, I'm sure you can probably think about or come up with the countries we're thinking about, whether it's Southeast Asia or Latin America. And we will probably go with like-minded partners, big robust organizations with a lot of track record of success with American brands within their geography and folks that we know that will have as much passion around what we do as the people in this building. So hopefully that gives you some additional color. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Scott Boatwright for the closing remarks. Scott Boatwright : Well, thank you all for listening in today. I was really proud of how the year landed. I'm really proud of this organization and what this team has accomplished, whether you're in our support centers, doing the good work, supporting our restaurant teams of 130,000 people out in our restaurants today that show up every day with a lot of passion around this idea of cultivating a better world. I couldn't be prouder of where we sit. I couldn't be more excited about the year ahead of us. Thank you all. Thank you all for listening in today and we'll talk soon. Operator : Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",
