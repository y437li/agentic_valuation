Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bill Currens. Please go ahead. Bill Currens - Vice President, Investor Relations : Thank you, Kay. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Duke Energy\u2019s first quarter 2014 earnings review and business update. Today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the Safe Harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today\u2019s materials. Please note that the appendix to today\u2019s presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures to help you analyze the company\u2019s performance. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, President and CEO along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks on the topics outlined on Slide 3, we will take your questions. Other members of the executive management team will be available during this portion of the call. Now, I will turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Bill and good morning everyone. Duke Energy\u2019s value proposition, as outlined on Slide 4, has remained consistent over time. We strive for excellence in our day-to-day operations and to deliver affordable and reliable services to our customers while leveraging our competitive advantages, including the additional capabilities we gained from the merger with Progress Energy in 2012. This focus gives us opportunities to deliver attractive returns to our investors through long-term earnings per share growth as well as the dividends. Our financial objectives have remained consistent over time and we have a strong track record of delivering on our commitments. I am very pleased with our overall strong first quarter. We reported first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.17 supported by revised customer rates and strong weather normalized retail customer load growth. These results leave us on track to achieve our previously announced 2014 guidance range of $4.45 to $4.60. We responded well operationally to challenging winter weather conditions and the Dan River ash discharge. I want to thank our dedicated team of employees who worked for these challenging conditions with great discipline and resolve. Before I turn the call over to Steve for more detail on the quarter, I would like to provide some business updates, review the status of our strategic initiatives in our commercial businesses, and discuss our progress on our growth investment opportunities. Turning to Slide 5, let me start with Dan River. By now, you have heard a great deal about the accidental discharge of coal ash that resulted from a pipe break under an ash basin in early February. We have taken responsibility and have moved aggressively on a number of fronts. I will talk about Dan River, the immediate actions we have taken and the longer term strategy we are putting in place. At Dan River, we moved quickly to stop the discharge at the site and have been working on remediation of the river. Our company, not our customers, will pay for the pipe break and associated cleanup. These costs were approximately $15 million in the first quarter. Drinking water has remained safe throughout this incident and ongoing water sampling by environmental experts shows that the Dan River has returned to normal water quality conditions. Decisions regarding our remediation work will continue to be informed by federal and state environmental agencies. Our overall goal is to ensure the long-term health of the river and its ecosystems. We also continue to cooperate with ongoing investigations, resulting from the Dan River accident and defend the company in pending litigations. What happened at Dan River has led to a broader conversation about coal ash management in North Carolina, which calls for some context. Duke Energy has disposed of coal ash in line with prevailing standards and industry norms since the 1920s when the company began generating power from coal. Coal ash management is an industry issue. There are currently a total of 676 ash basins across the nation. Duke manages 69 of these, 33 of which are in North Carolina. Establishing practices to safely and cost effectively close our ash basins has always been a priority for Duke. However, the Dan River incident has accelerated a reevaluation of our ash management strategies as outlined on Slide 6. We are currently performing an engineering review of each of our ash basins in order to implement both near-term and longer term actions addressing the ongoing management and retirement for each of our coal ash basins. Near-term actions for North Carolina basins were outlined in the plan we submitted in March to the North Carolina Governor and NCDENR. This site specific plan involves basin retirement at four sites : Dan River, Riverbend, Sutton and Asheville. The plant also addresses actions to convert to dry ash handling at our remaining active sites, the two units at Asheville and Cliffside Unit 5. The North Carolina legislature has said it intends to introduce ash basin legislation in the upcoming short session in North Carolina, which begins May 14. In preparation, the legislature through the Environmental Review Commission has conducted hearings with the expressed purpose of understanding more about the complex topic of ash basin management. At a recent hearing in which we participated, we shared a broad range of cost estimates, which included a range of site specific closure strategies for each basin, including cap in place, beneficial reuse, and movement to aligned landfills. We also discussed strategies for our active coal sites, including dry fly and bottom ash handling. By year end, we expect to complete our comprehensive longer term strategies for all of our 69 ash basins across all jurisdictions. We have a $5 billion to $6 billion overall environmental CapEx plan over the next 10 years, including estimated costs for pending air, water and waste regulations. Our waste assumptions, including coal ash, represent about 50% of this range. Our plans, including costs, will continue to be updated and refined as options are chosen and engineering plans are completed. These planning and cost estimates could be impacted by final regulations from the EPA, which are expected in December. We will work constructively with all key stakeholders on this important issue, including cost recovery. Our coal facilities have prudently served our customers with affordable and reliable power for decades. Cost recovery is currently determined by the state Utilities Commission. We are striving for prudent, environmentally sound and cost effective solutions. We will keep you updated on our progress in the months ahead. During the first quarter\u2019s extreme weather, our teams rose to the challenge and quickly restored service to our customers affected by two significant winter storms. As highlighted on Slide 7, a devastating ice storm in February crippled the Southeast, resulting in over 900,000 customer outages in our Carolina\u2019s territories. In March, we confronted the third largest ice storm ever to hit our North Carolina service territory causing over 800,000 customer outages. Our employees and contractors faced treacherous conditions caused by downed trees and power lines, but were diligent and safely restored service. These efforts resulted in about $80 million in storm restoration costs during the quarter. Our efforts with the February storm were recognized by the Executive Director of South Carolina\u2019s Office of Regulatory Staff. He declared that this storm was the most significant weather event in the state since Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and added when adversity strikes, we can count on Duke to serve the public and earn our admiration and respect. Again, I would like to extend my appreciation to our Duke Energy teams for meeting these extraordinary challenges and helping to provide customers with the level of service they have come to expect from us. The severe winter also demonstrated the value of our post-merger diversified generation fleet, in particular, in the Carolinas. In January, we set an all-time peak demand at Duke Energy Carolinas and a new winter peak demand at Duke Energy Progress. Our Midwest utilities in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky also set new winter peaks during the quarter. This weather coupled with fuel price volatility highlighted our joint dispatch capabilities for our Carolina customers. As shown on Slide 8, in the first quarter, we generated about $85 million in fuel and joint dispatch savings from our customers, that\u2019s the best quarter since the merger closed in mid-2012. Through the end of March, we had produced $275 million in cumulative savings towards the $687 million of guaranteed savings over the first five years after the merger. We are on track to meet this commitment, having achieved or locked-in about 80% of the total guaranteed fuel and joint dispatch savings for the renegotiated contracts. As you may remember, one of the conditions of the Progress merger required us to execute eight transmission expansion projects to mitigate FERC market power concerns. These projects were committed to be placed in service over time by July 1, 2015. To date, six of the eight projects have been placed in service. The remaining two projects are expected to be in service later this month placing us ahead of schedule and under budget for this important merger commitment. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 9 and our Edwardsport plant in Indiana, which began commercial operation last June. We estimated that Edwardsport would build up to its long-term level of availability over 15 months. Edwardsport is the large complex project and it has taken time to work out technical issues. Since the in-service date we have been monitoring our success by progressing through GE\u2019s new product introduction protocol, conducting detailed performance testing and optimization procedures, and obtaining valuable operating experience with the new facility. As discussed during our last earnings call, the extreme winter challenged Edwardsport\u2019s performance in the first two months of this year. We took advantage of this downtime by accelerating a scheduled spring maintenance outage into February. Performance significantly improved in March and April. All major technology systems have been validated and we continue to focus on final performance testing and optimization. We are on track to be within the total revised project estimate of $3.5 billion. The right side of Slide 9 outlines the upcoming regulatory calendar associated with the semi-annual IGCC riders and quarterly fuel adjustment clauses. In early April, the IURC issued its order approving our most recent quarterly fuel adjustment clause. In this order, the commission also approved a request by interveners to create a sub-docket to examine negative generation of the site in the fall of last year. A pre-hearing conference was held on April 23 and we are waiting on a procedural schedule. We will continue to provide updates on these important proceedings. Next on Slide 10, I will update you on our process to exit the merchant generation business, which we announced in February. As you will recall the businesses we are exiting includes 6,100 megawatts of coal and gas capacity serving the PJM wholesale markets as well as our competitive retail business Duke Energy Retail. Given the price volatility in this market, these Midwest generation assets are not a strategic fit for Duke. We have completed the required transfer of these assets outside of the utility. The marketing process has begun and we expect first round bids to be submitted this quarter. Our expectation is that final bids, approvals, and the closing process will likely extend into the first quarter of 2015. We expect the redeployment of proceeds to be accretive to our adjusted earnings per share. As a result of our planned exit from this business, we have recognized a pretax impairment loss of approximately $1.4 billion in the first quarter. Steve will discuss the accounting implications in a moment. Next let\u2019s turn to our international business as shown on Slide 11. International includes 4,600 megawatts of generation in Latin America, about half of which is hydro generation in Brazil. This business represents between 10% and 15% of Duke Energy\u2019s earnings mix and has historically been a very good performer. I will start with an update on reservoir levels and rain conditions in Brazil. Reservoir levels were at about 39% at the end of April versus 62% last year at this time. Thermal generation units are being used to preserve reservoir levels and meet customer demand. In anticipation of low reservoir levels and high electric demand, we strategically reduced our targeted 2014 contracted percentage for our hydro generation. This strategy has supported our strong results to-date by providing greater opportunities to sell power into attractive spot markets. We will continue to monitor conditions. We will keep you informed as the year progresses. Second, as announced earlier this year, we are conducting a strategic review of the international business. We are evaluating growth opportunities including potential tax effective strategies for domestic use of offshore cash. We have an internal timeline to complete this review by late 2014 or early 2015. And we will keep you informed on this process. Let me also comment briefly on our growth investment opportunities. We are continuing to actively pursue a number of projects that will support our 4% to 6% earnings per share growth rate, including new generation, infrastructure projects and environmental and regulatory compliance. For the period from 2014 through 2018, we are targeting $16 billion to $20 billion of growth investments as outlined on Slide 12. We are making excellent progress on all fronts and I will mention a few of these initiatives. First in April, the South Carolina Public Service Commission issued a certificate enabling us to move forward with a new 750 megawatt combined cycle natural gas plant at our existing W.S. Lee site in South Carolina. We expect the plant could enter commercial service by late 2017. Second, we had a very strong response to our request for proposals for regulated solar projects in North Carolina, including both PPA and ownership options. We announced in April that we have received proposals amounting to nearly three times our goal of up to 300 megawatts of new solar capacity. Achieving this goal would almost double our available solar capacity In North Carolina. We are very encouraged by this response and expect to select the winning projects and complete negotiations in the fourth quarter. The selected project should be online by the end of 2015. Third, we continue to negotiate with the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency regarding our potential to purchase their minority ownership interest in certain Duke Energy Progress plants. If we are able to finalize the purchase agreement as well as the terms of a wholesale power contract, potential next steps would include approvals by FERC, the Department of Justice, the NRC for transfer of nuclear licenses and the Carolinas Commission. We are also continuing to move forward with plans for new natural gas generation in Florida. We are evaluating bids for combined cycle base load generation to be in service in 2018. These bids have been submitted through our RFP process including our self-build option for 1,640 megawatts. The company has a need for additional generating resources in the 2016 to 2018 timeframe. We are analyzing whether to meet these needs with new peaking units, plan to operate, purchase power agreements, plant acquisitions or a combination of these resources. We expect to make filings with the Florida Commission in the coming weeks outlining the most cost effective options for our Florida customers. And finally in April, Duke Energy and Piedmont Natural Gas jointly issued a solicitation for proposals to build and operate a major interstate gas pipeline in North Carolina. This will help to meet the growing demand for natural gas in the Carolinas, now served by a single major interstate pipeline. Duke Energy and Piedmont Natural Gas would consider a wide range of ownership options in support of the selected proposal. We expect to choose the winning bidder by the end of this year. This slide also includes other investment opportunities that we are pursuing. Taken together, this diverse portfolio of investments supports our commitment to customers and our ability to grow and achieve our financial objective. Now, I will turn the call over to Steve to discuss our financial performance for the quarter. Steve Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Lynn. Today I will focus on three primary areas. First, I will discuss the key drivers to our first quarter results and update you on the status of our earnings guidance range for 2014. I will also review the first quarter and full year accounting implications related to the exit of our Midwest generation fleet. Second, I will discuss our volume trends and the economic conditions within our service territories. Finally, I will close with our progress towards achieving our overall financial objectives. First quarter 2014 adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.17. These results as shown on Slide 13 exceeded 2013\u2019s first quarter results of $1.02 per share. Our quarterly adjusted results were supported by revised customer rates and strong growth in weather normal retail customer demand. The impact of favorable weather was largely offset by increased storm restoration costs. As Lynn mentioned in her prepared remarks, we have affirmed our 2014 earnings guidance range of $4.45 to $4.60 per share. On a reported basis, the company experienced a quarterly net loss of $0.14 per share compared to $0.89 of per share earnings last year. Reported earnings this quarter were impacted by a pre-tax impairment charge of $1.4 billion or a loss of $1.23 per share associated with the exit of the Midwest generation business. This impairment was based upon a fair value estimate for these assets and it has been treated as a special item. Our fair value assumptions will be refined if necessary as we move through the sales process. A reconciliation of our reported results to our adjusted results is included in the supplemental materials. Adjusted earnings at our regulated utilities business increased by $0.11 per share primarily due to revised customer rates and strong weather normalized retail customer load growth. Increased pricing and riders led to higher earnings of $0.12 compared to last year primarily driven by our 2013 rate cases in the Carolinas and Ohio. The impact of this quarter\u2019s unusually cold weather led to higher adjusted earnings per share of $0.08 compared to last year and $0.09 when compared to normal weather conditions. The Carolinas have the second highest number of heating degree days of any first quarter over the last 20 years, while the Midwest achieved its highest level over that same time period. Growth in retail customer demand led to higher earnings per share of $0.06 during the quarter. I will provide more color on our customer load growth trends in a moment. Our wholesale business added $0.03 per share in the quarter. This growth was supported by increased contractual commitments, colder weather and volume growth compared to last year. These positive drivers were partially offset by around $0.07 per share of higher depreciation expense driven by prior year cost of removal amortization in Florida and additional depreciation in 2014 for new plants and service. O&M costs were around $0.05 per share higher during the quarter. Quarterly O&M was impacted by the additional storm restoration costs that Lynn highlighted of around $0.07 per share. Excluding these storm costs, O&M was slightly lower as a result of our ongoing cost management efforts and a $0.02 nuclear outage cost levelization benefit in the Carolinas. Interest expense was higher by around $0.03 per share primarily due to lower post in service debt returns on projects now reflected in customer rates. Next, I will address international\u2019s results, which were $0.04 per share higher than the prior year quarter. These results were impacted by higher earnings in Latin America of $0.06 mostly in Brazil. Our reduced contracting strategy, that Lynn discussed, resulted in more sales volumes into the spot market at higher prices. These favorable results were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, a $0.02 drag compared to last year. Next, moving to commercial power, adjusted results for this segment were flat during the quarter. However, there were some offsetting drivers. Results from our renewables business were $0.01 per share higher than last year driven by increased wind production and lower development cost. We expect this business to generate around $50 million in net income this year. Next, let me discuss Midwest generation. Results for the Midwest gas generation units were around $0.01 higher driven by higher realized power prices. These results were substantially offset by lower earnings from the Midwest coal fleet of around $0.01 per share due to outages experienced during the extreme cold weather. As a result of these outages, we were required to purchase high-priced power to meet our hedged commitments. Duke Energy Retail also had unfavorable earnings in the quarter of $0.01. Our retail business hedges its contracted volumes assuming normal weather. When demand surged in January, Duke Energy Retail was forced to buy high-priced power in the market to meet this increased demand. Finally, let me spend a moment discussing some important accounting changes that will occur with our Midwest generation fleet. Since we have started a process to exit this business, the plants are classified as assets held for sale in our financial statements as of March 31. As a result of this classification, for the remainder of the year, there will be no further depreciation expense recognized on the plants. And since the assets have been reduced to their estimated fair market value, any future maintenance capital expenditures will likely be expensed as incurred. We expect these two changes to largely offset each other. We will continue to recognize any earnings from these plants in the company\u2019s adjusted diluted earnings per share until a sales transaction is closed. Slide 14 highlights our retail customer volume trends for the quarter and the economic conditions within our service territories. Quarterly weather normal retail customer load was 2.6% higher than 2013 along with a 1.6% higher trend over the last 12 months. This was the third consecutive quarter we have experienced strong retail load growth. We are very encouraged and are seeing more signs of sustained economic improvement throughout our service territories. The economic recovery has expanded as credit has loosened, household income has increased, and overall unemployment rates have declined. In fact, over the past year, the unemployment rate in the Carolinas and Indiana has declined by around 2% well in excess of the national average decline of around 0.8%. These trends have resulted in higher consumer confidence, which has led to higher electricity consumption by our customers. Duke\u2019s service territories remain attractive for business expansion. During the quarter, our commercial and industrial customers announced significant capital investments for new facilities with the expansion of existing one. These investments are expected to add over 3,000 jobs across our regulated territories. Next, let me highlight some of the trends we are seeing in each of our customer classes. First, our residential customers, where we had quarter-over-quarter growth of 2.9% we experienced higher usage per customer of around 2% as it compared to negative usage customer trends at this time last year. Some of the first quarter growth in usage per customer can be explained by the extreme weather across our service territories when customers were forced to stay at home and use more power than normal. However, improved economic data leads us to believe this strength is more sustainable rather than a one-time event. We also continue to experience growth in the average number of customers across our service territories. Since the first quarter of 2013, we have added approximately 70,000 new electric customers, an average increase of around 1%. We haven\u2019t seen this level of new customer percentage growth since 2008. Next, our commercial class experienced growth of 3.6% in the first quarter, primarily supported by strong activity in the Carolinas and Florida. Employment rates and real income levels have continued to improve leading to growth in retail sales for this segment. Office vacancy rates were also favorable throughout our service territories. In the first quarter of 2014, we also experienced significant growth in demand from datacenters in the Duke Energy Carolinas service territory. Higher sales were also seen in the hospitality, healthcare, education and professional business services sectors when compared to last year. And finally, the industrial sector continues to experience steady improvement. Industrial production remains above expectations due to strong demand for manufactured, durable, and non-durable goods. We are seeing continued strength in the automotive, construction, and metal sub-sectors. Industrial demand in the first quarter was tempered by factory shutdowns and delays in the delivery of raw materials due to the impact of the winter weather. We are optimistic about the sustainability of the economic recovery across our service territories and encouraged by the growth we have experienced over the last three quarters as well as over a rolling 12-month basis. We will continue to monitor these trends and provide updates throughout the year. I will close with our financial objectives for 2014 in the longer term as outlined on Slide 15. I am very pleased with our financial performance through the first quarter of 2014. Based upon our results to-date and assuming normal weather for the remainder of the year, we are evaluating opportunities to accelerate some O&M expenses from future periods into 2014. We will update you on our plans later in the year. The balance sheet remains strong. We recently conducted annual meetings with the rating agencies. These discussions were constructive and our ratings outlook is stable at all three agencies. Our strong balance sheet allows us the flexibility to invest in our business and grow our dividend without the need for new equity issuances through 2016. We are focused on growing the dividend, which is central to our investor value proposition. We expect to achieve our long-term payout ratio of 65% to 70% in 2014 allowing greater flexibility and future dividend growth. Finally, we continue to make progress on our dividend growth initiatives \u2013 on our growth initiatives and cost savings projects. We remain well positioned to grow longer term earnings within our targeted range of 4% to 6%. We continue to execute on our overall financial objectives. Now, I will turn it back over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Thanks Steve. I am proud of how our team responded to the operational challenges of the first quarter, while remaining focused on our mission to provide customers with safe, reliable and cost effective service. We also made great progress on our 2014 and longer-term financial objectives and have taken important steps on our strategic initiatives to build a stronger future. We will continue to execute on our mission to deliver exceptional results to benefit our customers, communities and investors. Now let\u2019s open up the lines for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And we will go first to Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse : Hey, good morning guys. Lynn Good : Good morning Dan. Steve Young : Good morning. Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse : Just following up on maybe Steve\u2019s kind of closing comments about your load growth and what you are seeing, first quarter represented yet another quarter of better than planned load in trailing 12 months is pretty supportive of a higher growth rate than what you talked about. When are you guys going to decide that maybe growth is at a higher level and what bearing will that have on \u2013 how you are prioritizing the growth CapEx you have laid out in the slides today? Lynn Good : Dan, I will take a stab at it and Steve I am sure will have something to add to it. We are optimistic about what we are seeing with three quarters. I think when we look at a really weather impacted quarter, however, the science to pull weather out isn\u2019t perfect, and so we would love to see another quarter of strength before we formally revise estimates. So that\u2019s how we are looking at it, but we feel like we have seen some strength here that gives us some optimism about the future. In terms of prioritization of investments, we continue to focus on deploying about 85% to 90% of our capital into our regulated businesses. We are also continuing to focus on building our commercial renewables business. And so you I would think about those initiatives progressing and the timing will really be dictated in many ways by regulatory approvals and as these opportunities develop. So that\u2019s where I would leave it on the prioritization. Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse : And then I guess on your commercial ops with the impairment this quarter, can you just give us an update A, on where that process sits, where you expect \u2013 when do you expect something to be announced or formalized. And then with your AEP and FirstEnergy both talking about the idea of long-term contracting or some sort of re-regulation in Ohio, is that going to prospectively change your timing for moving forward with the sale? Lynn Good : Dan, we are continuing to progress with the sale process. We are targeting first round bids here in this quarter, so second quarter and then we would expect the process to continue. And we will update as we go and meet milestones on that process. In parallel, we are of course monitoring what\u2019s going on in Ohio. AEP in particular has put forward an ESP that has a non-bypassable charge intended to provide customers with some stability around what could be market volatility. I think they have introduced the OVAC asset and potentially others. So we will continue to monitor that. I think Ohio has begun to recognize that extreme weather conditions such as the Polar Vortex may be creating reliability concerns for the state. So we will monitor how that conversation progresses. Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse : So, could that change your decision to sell if it looks like there was an alternative to contracts in Ohio or to some sort of other structure? Lynn Good : Dan, we are not thinking about it that way at this point. We are moving through the sale process. We think that makes the \u2013 fits with our strategic objectives to reduce that volatility in those assets, but we will update you as that process progresses and as we have more to say about how it\u2019s progressing. Dan Eggers - Credit Suisse : Okay. Thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith, UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS: Thank you. Good morning. Steve Young : Good morning. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS: So perhaps the follow-up, a little bit on the last question. Shifting over to Indiana, could you perhaps give us a little bit of an update as far as you see recovery of both O&M and purchase power, and how do you the latest sub-docket working out as far as Edwardsport goes? Lynn Good : So, actually in the slide deck, Julien, there are a couple of Slides, 9 and 25 that lay out the sub-dockets that are pending in Indiana. So, a sub-docket has been opened on fuel recovery really focused on the latter part of 2013 and the issue raised by interveners on negative generation. We do not yet have a procedural schedule on that and we will need to just progress that and update as it occurs. Our focus in Indiana is really on continuing to ramp up and complete our performance testing, optimizing the asset and moving through this important transition. I am pleased that generation has improved in March and April, and the team is very focused on continuing to deliver strong results out of the asset. So I think we will have to move through the regulatory process in the weeks and months to come, and as we have items to update, we will certainly do that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS: Perhaps to clarify rather, is it that both purchase power and O&M is at risk, or is it one versus the other; just if you could perhaps elaborate a little bit on that? Lynn Good : Julien, there are two types of riders, right. So it\u2019s a fuel is the one I just spoke about where the commission has opened a sub-docket on fuel and focusing specifically on this negative generation in the fourth quarter. That proceeding is specific to fuel. There are also ongoing filings in the IGCC riders, which addresses return and address O&M recovery. And so I believe the commission has approved through IGC 11, we have 12 that we are waiting for approval on and we are filing 13. And so those would be the dockets in which interveners could challenge costs and O&M and so on. And I think that\u2019s something we will have to monitor over time. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS:  Great. And then following up on the results in the quarter here in Brazil, especially given the hedging, how is this meeting your plan that you articulated earlier this year, how are you feeling about that. And ultimately, how do you think about the energy rationing as it stands today and the prospects for that and how would that impact you or what have you? Lynn Good : So the Brazilian operation is off to a strong start for the first quarter, Julien. And we actually benefited from the hedging strategy because we had the opportunity to sell generation into a high priced spot market. As we continue to look at the balance of the year, we are watching this very closely. We like the fact that we have a little bit more flexibility in our contracting position which gives us some protection if the regulator or government were to move into a rationing or voluntary rationing situation, but we do not have any further information on that at this point. I think given the political environment in Brazil, the World Cup, the elections, I think that\u2019s going to be reviewed very closely by the government and by the regulator. So we are watching it everyday. We are watching rainfall. We are looking at dispatch. We are looking at spot prices. And of course, also looking ahead to 2015 and how that could impact our contracting strategy for 2015. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS: Great. And the last detail, have you delineated O&M versus capital costs for coal ash in Carolina and elsewhere? Lynn Good : We have not \u2013 what we have put forward are ranges of costs around closure, around investment to dry handling and the installation of certain of these capital costs will drive O&M, but we have not provided specific ranges on the O&M at this point. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS: Great. Thank you. Lynn Good : Thanks Julien. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research : Yes. Hi good morning. Lynn Good : Hi Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research : So just a few questions on the coal ash issues, the independent engineering report that you are doing, that\u2019s going to be done by the end of May, are you going to have to make that public right then to us or how is that going to get released? Lynn Good : Steve we are moving through the third party engineering in a sequential way kind of working through all of the basins and to the extent, there are items identified that we should address from a maintenance standpoint. We are addressing those. And what we have committed to do is provide periodic updates on our short-term and longer term actions when we reach specific milestones. We are also updating the regulators on these milestones. So, I haven\u2019t \u2013 we haven\u2019t made a specific commitment on what we will do around May 31, but you can expect us to make updates on the progress on our short-term plans as the year progresses. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research : Okay. And then just on the legislative session, you said there is a short session, just what are the proposals that you are expecting to hear and how long is this session? Lynn Good : It should wrap up in early July, Steve, so May 15 to early July. Steve Young : That\u2019s correct. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research : Okay. Lynn Good : And I think proposals will develop as the session gets started. I have referenced in my comments that there has been a lot of work by the legislative body on education trying to understand the complex topic. So, I think as the session starts, we will have more information on specifics. I think you are aware we have put forward a plan that lays out specific actions around certain plants. We have also laid out a plan to accelerate investment in dry fly ash handling also moving forward with dewatering certain of the retired ponds. So we are moving forward on those actions and would expect those to be considered, although we can\u2019t speak fully to how the legislature will address the issue broadly, but certainly that plan would be considered I think as part of the go-forward strategy. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research : Okay. Just last question, where do you stand overall on your coal piles maybe you can just give some color there? And are you having to take any actions to kind of preserve coal into the summer? Lynn Good : Steve, we are in good shape. It has been a challenging delivery time during the first quarter, but we feel comfortable with where our inventory is across the system. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research : Okay, thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : We will now take Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank : Good morning. Lynn Good : Good morning, Jonathan. Steve Young : Good morning. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank : Couple of questions. First on Edwardsport, Lynn, it\u2019s good to hear that it\u2019s running about March and April, but can you be a bit more specific what type of range of cap factor have you been able to achieve more recently? Are we just talking about the combined cycle or is this also the gasifier piece of it as well? Just a bit more color on what you mean by running better? Lynn Good : So, Jonathan, when I talk about running better, I am talking about running on the gasifiers. And so, the month of April was the third best month since the plant has been in service. I don\u2019t have a specific capacity factor in front of me, but kind of trending up March was a strong month and then April stronger. So, we do provide monthly updates to the IURC on our generation statistics. So I think if you follow up with IR, we could probably give you little more specifics on how that generation is occurring. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And you feel confident that it\u2019s going to sort of ramp from here or is there another sort of period where it has to sort of go through more testing and step back a bit or as we\u2026 Lynn Good : Yes, we are finalizing performance testing with General Electric hopefully in the month of May. And we have taken the outage in February to address some of the issues that we experienced from severe weather earlier in the year. So, I think at this point, Jonathan, it\u2019s continuing to improve performance as optimizing procedures. And I think the team if they were on the call would tell you, they have increasing experiences \u2013 increasing experience on the operating profile of the plant is improving over time, there is greater confidence in operations, but it\u2019s a complex project and we are learning everyday, but I feel like we have the right resources devoted to it and we are working hard to continue to improve operations. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank : Is this something about the technology and very cold weather or that might impair its performance in the future in winter time or was it because you were in startup? Lynn Good : Jonathan, I do think we learned some things from the weather in Indiana, which was 30 degrees below what we would normally experience. So, my hope and expectation is that we saw the worst of the worst this winter and have been able to address operational challenges as a result of that. But let me turn it over to Keith Trent or Dhiaa who have been very involved in this and see if they have anything to add to that. Keith Trent : Sure. Jonathan, I would just add one thing and that is there is nothing that was unique about the technology that was impacted specifically by the cold weather. As Lynn said, it was extremely cold, 30 degrees below what we have seen in the past, but it was more exposure of components to extreme cold like transmitters, those sorts of things that are not any kind of unique technology, but we learned from that and we can apply heating methods, which we have done, so that we can remedy that, but there is nothing unique about the technology that\u2019s causing us concerns. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank : Great, thank you. Then I if I might I will just \u2013 on another just a big picture, if another quarter confirms what you seem to suspect, which is that your sales have begun to tick higher, how should we think about that as it would impact your overall plan? Does it push out rate case timings? Does it mean we are going to have to step up capital spending in certain areas? Well, how would uptick in sales sort of change what you have laid out for us? Lynn Good : Jonathan, I feel like an uptick in sales is the best possible thing that can happen, not only to Duke Energy, but to the economies that we serve. When you see improvement in the industrial base, in commercial and new customers being added, I think it\u2019s all around a good outcome. I think it will give us some things to think about in terms of timing of rate cases and capital deployment and we have begun some of that thinking and when we are prepared to share it with you, we will give you some more feedback on it, but generally, I think this is a very good thing. Steve Young : Yes, I think that we are in the process now Jonathan of updating our forecasts and we go through this process every year for the integrated resource planning process, which is our long-term planning mechanism that we share with the commission and that drives a lot of our generation planning and rate case planning and so forth. So we will be putting through those mechanisms and these changes and see what it yields. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank : And what will the timing of resource plan updates be? Steve Young : We typically \u2013 it varies per jurisdiction. We will typically do it in the spring and the fall in the Carolinas as an example. Jonathan Arnold - Deutsche Bank : Thank you very much guys. Lynn Good : Thank you, Jonathan. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Turnure with JPMorgan. Chris Turnure - JPMorgan: Good morning, Lynn and Steve. Lynn Good : Good morning. Chris Turnure - JPMorgan: Could you guys give us a little bit more color on the RFP process in North Carolina for the new pipeline? I am thinking kind of along the lines of total cost and then when we would actually see incremental information as to whether or not you are going to offer in a self-build proposal? Lynn Good : Chris, we are early in the process. So, we have announced a solicitation with an expectation on the timeline that would put us in a position to announce a winning bid, if you will, by the end of this year. And we are evaluating a range of options, which would also include ownership interest on the part of Duke and Piedmont. And we will update you as we go. We have not disclosed nor do we have a broad range of investment at this point. We are anxious to talk with the various bidders about what they see the potential to be and as we have more information we will share it with you. I think this is a terrific opportunity, not only to underpin infrastructure for electricity, but I think it\u2019s opportunity for economic development in the eastern part of North Carolina. So, we are at work putting together a project that we think could be very strategic for the state. Chris Turnure - JPMorgan: Okay, great. And then any updated thoughts on M&A given what we have seen in the past couple of weeks here in utility lines? Lynn Good : Nothing different than what we have said previously. We like the business mix that we have. We like the complement of jurisdictions that we serve. We would consider M&A, but it would need to be an opportunistic type thing. It\u2019s certainly not something that we see as a must-have from a strategic standpoint. So we are monitoring all of it, Chris and would consider opportunities, but nothing beyond that at this point. Chris Turnure - JPMorgan: Great, thanks. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : We will now take Brian Chin with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Brian Chin - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning. Lynn Good : Hi, Brian. Steve Young : Good morning. Brian Chin - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Going back to the coal ash issue, would it be reasonable for us to think about the projections you have given on the different options for North Carolina that\u2019s roughly comparable to how we think about the costs of coal ash remediation in other states where you have similar pond issues, is that sort of the right way to think about it or are the coal \u2013 North Carolina coal ash issues so site specific that it wouldn\u2019t be reasonable to broadly assume those cost assumptions for other ponds? Lynn Good : Let me try to jump in on that, Brian. So and I am sure in the back of your mind, you are referencing the testimony that we presented to the Commission or the Environmental Commission in the legislature. As we have put out our $5 billion to $6 billion estimate for the 10-year environmental plan that has included addressing \u2013 ash pond closure results have included addressing conversion to dry bottom ash and fly ash in anticipation of where the steam effluent guidelines will go. We have as part of our short-term action plan modified that estimate for four sites in the Carolinas by evaluating a closure option that actually moves all the ash to a lined landfill. And so that has added roughly $500 million to our estimates. So it\u2019s moved from 4.5 to 5.5 to 5 to 6. Further refinement of the estimate around waste will be accomplished as we complete our strategic review side by side of all of our ash basins around our system. And so it\u2019s really premature for us to give you more specifics on the estimate or how it will be implicated in other jurisdictions because it will be dependent upon a couple of things. First of all, our strategy and in the case of North Carolina what we expect to be legislation in the state. As we talk about our other jurisdictions, we do not see an immediate push around legislation or change in policies in the same manner as we are seeing in North Carolina. Brian Chin - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Understood, very helpful. And on that last point about other jurisdictions, is it right now your expectation that resolution in North Carolina will likely lead how other states and your conversations will be resolved on coal ash or is there a possibility that the discussion with those other jurisdictions has been accelerated, given what\u2019s happened with North Carolina and you could see resolution in other states potentially setting a precedent for how North Carolina looks at this? Lynn Good : At least among our jurisdictions, Brian, North Carolina is in the lead in terms of this discussion. And I think if you think back into the earlier part of the 2000s, North Carolina put forward industry leading set of legislation called Clean Smokestacks where they were instrumental in accelerating investments in environmental around air. And so I think this represents an opportunity for North Carolina to do the same around ash. And as we have moved through this short session, we will have a better sense of how the policy will be developed for the state. And I do think we have an opportunity in North Carolina to lead. Brian Chin - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Very good. And then one last quick one, for the strategic review on the international front, in the past when the strategic review has concluded, basically we haven\u2019t seen a major confirmation from the company in terms of direction one way or another. With the conclusion of this strategic review, is it the intention of the company to provide a positive conclusion regardless of what the decisions is or is it more likely that it will simply be concluded privately and no more future mention of that will happen until the next strategic review? Lynn Good : We intend to disclose from the strategic reviews completing what our conclusions are. Brian Chin - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. Lynn Good : Thank you, Brian. Operator : We will now take Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie: Thank you. Good morning, given that you are in the process of selling your plants in the Midwest, should we expect that this process will impact your bidding strategy into the PJM auction? Lynn Good : Angie I have not spent any time on bidding strategy for the PJM auction. Steve Young : I do not think that will impact our strategy, the sales process, it will not change any strategic intent there. Lynn Good : But let\u2019s follow-up on that with the IR team on PJM bidding strategy to the... Angie Storozynski - Macquarie: Secondly, on the load growth I do see the numbers, but they do seem impressive, however, they tend to be significantly skewed towards the residential and commercial load, the strength and those two groups tends to be most impacted by the weather, right. I mean the fact that there is such a big discrepancy in the industrial load growth versus residential and commercial could suggest that \u2013 as you said yourself that those weather minimization models are a little bit off or it could be that your service territory is specifically different, meaning less industrial, how would you describe that? Lynn Good : I think there are a couple of things I would point to and Steve can certainly add to this. We did see an increase in usage per customer, Angie. So in addition to strong customer growth, we saw an increase in the usage per customer. It\u2019s hard to know exactly why that\u2019s occurring, but frankly because of the extreme weather we had parts of the Carolinas that were home for days at a time. And we do think we had a little bit of additional usage on a per customer basis as a result of that. The other thing I would point to is when I look at the residential trend, third quarter was up 1.1%, fourth quarter was up 0.7%, both of which are pretty strong numbers. Similarly, commercial was up 1.6% in the third quarter and 1.2% in the fourth quarter. So the other thing I would point you to is over a rolling 12 months period we are kind of at 1.6%. So I don\u2019t have a perfect answer to \u2013 do we have a little bit of weather in the volumes, I think that there is a possibility we have some weather. That\u2019s why we are continuing to monitor the second quarter, will give us another good indication. It will not be as weather influenced. So when we look at all of the factors together including their performance in third and fourth quarter, we believe we are seeing a trend. Steve Young : That\u2019s right. We have added 70,000 customers. So that\u2019s a stronger number than we have seen. And some of the data that we look at median household income, that\u2019s looking at middle income growth is stronger than we have seen before in the past. The unemployment rate changes are significant as well. So it feels like the economic recovery is broadening and deepening a bit and getting into the pockets of smaller businesses and middle income residences. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie: And my last question, so about your coal plant, so you are showing us this very high potential capital that\u2019s associated with coal ash remediation. And then we are approaching June 1 when the EPA is supposed to issue carbon dioxide emission rules and I am trying to understand given that both of these are actually going to properly resolve in a pretty significant uptick in your electric rates, how do you think can all of this CapEx and additional costs be recovered without actually a rate shock? Lynn Good : Angie, I think the thing to keep in mind on ash is that that expenditure is going to occur over a very long period of time. So even on the short-term action plan that we put forward of $500 million, it is going to occur over like two to five years. And over the \u2013 if you look at some of the higher end numbers that we have put forward assuming that all ash gets moved, those numbers are over 20 to 30 years. It will just physically take that long to accomplish. So I think that\u2019s an important consideration for you to think about when you think about ash. And I think on greenhouse gases in general, we are going to have to evaluate how those rules come out, how they come forward, what kind of flexibility is offered in the states. I do think there is a lot of focus on the part of the EPA on reliability and giving the states flexibility. And so I think we will have to evaluate where those rules come out before we can conclude what the implication will be to rates. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie: But your current RFP for solar in the Carolinas and potentially putting it into the rate base is not in anyway related to potential carbon regulations in your attempt to offset your carbon footprint? Lynn Good : Yes. It is in connection with both a customer demand for solar, but also we have a renewable energy portfolio standard in North Carolina, Angie. And this would be a part of the compliance with that standard. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie: Okay. Thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : We will now take Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs : Hey guys. Congrats on a good start of the year. Lynn Good : Thank you, Michael. Steve Young : Thank you. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs : You\u2019re welcome. A question, one for Steve, one for Lynn. Lynn, can you talk about just the range of options when you think about a strategic review of the Latin American business, what\u2019s off the table? Lynn Good : Michael, I am not sure that there is anything off the table. What we try to do when we come to a strategic review like this is consider all options that we are looking at. We have got a great business, a great position, profitable businesses that have been a strong contributor to the company over time. We have some headwinds in the form of foreign currency. We don\u2019t see the growth that we would like to see in that business. So, we are really solving for two things. Is there a way we can better position the business for growth? Is there a better way we can position the business to optimize cash flow? And over what timeframe and what are the trade-offs that we need to consider to accomplish that? So, I wouldn\u2019t say there is anything off the table at this point, but we are trying to be open-minded and explore as many options as we can think of. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs : Got it. And Steve, you made some comments about O&M both in the quarter, but also about maybe moving forward some O&M, can you \u2013 and I know you had the storm related O&M during the first quarter of this year. Can you just talk about O&M trajectory how 2014 looks like versus what your original guidance for O&M was in \u201814? And then what does that mean for beyond \u201814? Steve Young : Certainly, certainly. The O&M trajectory has not changed and we intend to keep non-fuel O&M flat through \u201816 and we see very positive trends thus far in \u201814. When you pull the storm cost out, we actually see O&M down a bit and we are continuing to find through integration projects and moving people to similar processes and platforms and IT systems additional benefits to offset emergent costs. So, we feel very good about our O&M trajectory. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs : Got it. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Lynn. Much appreciated. Lynn Good : Thank you, Mike. Operator : And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks. Lynn Good - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, thank you everyone. Thank you for your interest and investment in Duke and we look forward to seeing many of you in the weeks and months to come. Thanks again. Operator : Once again, ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Bill Currens. Please go ahead. Bill Currens : Thank you, Randy. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Duke Energy's second quarter 2014 earnings review and business update. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the Safe Harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today's materials. Please note that the appendix to today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures to help you analyze the company's performance. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, President and CEO along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Other members of the executive management team will be available during this portion of the call. A few weeks ago, we announced the launch of the Duke Energy Investor Relations App, which can be downloaded for free in the App Store or Google Play. This App allows those of you on mobile devices to easily access and download some of the company's most commonly used investor relations materials including press releases, SEC filing, presentations and webcast. All of this morning, second quarter earning materials have been uploaded to the App in addition to being available on the company's website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Earlier today we've released the results for another strong quarter. As a result of our financial performance for the first half of the year, we have increased our 2014 adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.05 to $4.50 to $4.65 per share. I'm very pleased with how we are executing our growth strategy, delivering on our commitments and building positive momentum for the future. July marked the second anniversary of the merger between Duke and Progress. As a result of great focus and team work, we've exceeded expectations from the combination. After two years, we have achieved 45% of our total five year fuel and joint dispatch savings commitment for Carolina's customers. We've exceeded our original non-fuel O&M savings target and we recently completed the eighth required transmission project, ahead of schedule and under budget. We believe the combination continues to deliver significant value for customers and shareholders. As we leverage our scale and operations and in capital deployment. This morning, I would like to update you on the progress of our growth projects, our efforts to maximize value from our commercial portfolio and the status of our efforts around coal ash management and the operational performance of Edwardsport. Then I will turn the call over to Steve to discuss the specifics of the quarter. First growth, for the 5-year period from 2014 through 2018, we are targeting between $16 billion and $20 billion of growth investments. These investments include new generation, infrastructure projects and regulatory compliance initiatives, all of which underpinned are 4% to 6% long-term earnings per share growth rate. The investments is outlined on Slide 4, allow us to meet the needs of our customers and grow the company well into the future. We have made significant progress to advance our portfolio of new generation projects including gas fired generation in Florida and South Carolina and renewable generation in our commercial and regulated businesses. In mid-May we announced plans for three major constructions projects in Florida as outlined on Slide 5. These projects represent a total investment of about $1.9 billion and include a 1,640 MW combined cycle plant in Citrus County. Two new combustion turbine plants that are existing Suwannee plant and an operate project at our Hines Energy Complex. These projects are expected to be in service by the end of 2018. The Florida Public Service Commission will hold hearings on these projects later this month, with an order anticipated this fall. Next, turning to South Carolina we received commission approval in April for our proposed 750 MW Lee combined cycle natural gas plant. The plant is expected to be operational in late 2017 and Duke's share of the investment is expected to be approximately $600 million. Turning to Slide 6, while provide an update on our renewable growth investments. Through 2018, we are targeting total investments of around $2 billion in our regulated and commercial renewable businesses. We presently have 400 MW of wind and approximately 100 MW of solar under construction in our commercial businesses. In a regulated business, we were encouraged by the strong response we received to our solar RSP in North Carolina and are presently negotiating power purchase agreements and ownership options for approximately 300 MW of regulated solar generation. We are also pleased with progress in South Carolina, where the state recently passed comprehensive solar legislation to encourage development of renewable generation. This legislation followed a yearlong collaborative process with important environmental stakeholders. We expect to invest in or incentivize renewable generation of up to 3% our peak load capacity by the end of 2021 representing approximately 150 MW. The law also establishes a process for the commission to review net metering rates, which we expect to occur over the next nine months to 12 months. We will continually to work collaboratively with all interest stakeholders as this legislation is implemented. As summarized on Slide 7, last week we announced an agreement to purchase the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency's minority ownership and certain existing Duke Energy Progress plants. In all about 700 MW of nuclear and scrubbed coal generation that we already operate. The asset purchase price is $1.2 billion and we would also enter into a 30-year full requirement wholesale contract to supply power to NCEMPA. This agreement provides benefit to both the customers of Duke Energy Progress and the members of NCEMPA. If approved, this transactions would be one of the largest municipal power plant transactions on record. Under the agreement, we are required to close the transactions by the end of 2016. This project is incremental to the capital plan that we shared with you in February and provides additional support to our long-term earnings per share growth objective of 4% to 6%. The ultimate annual earnings contribution from this investment will be dependent upon the timing of closing, appropriate regulatory treatment and how the company chooses to finance the transaction. We currently expected full year earnings, uplift of between $0.05 and $0.10 per share. There are a number of important regulatory milestones that are critical to the successful execution of this purchase. We expect to start this process with FERC filing at the end of this month and will provide updates as the approval progresses. Let me also highlight a couple of infrastructure investments that we are developing. As you know last year, Indiana passed [indiscernible] 560, which was design to streamline implementation and recovery for transmission and distribution infrastructure needs, we plan to make the filing this year resulting in potential investments over 7 years of between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. And in April, Duke Energy and Piedmont Natural Gas jointly issued a solicitation for a major new natural gas pipeline into North Carolina. We received initial bids in June and expect to announce the winner within the next several weeks. While Carolina's utilities expect to enter into a gas transportation contract with the pipeline and we are pursuing an ownership interest in the pipeline underpinning the projects financial liability. The RFP has an initial capacity of at least 900 million cubic feet per day with a targeted and service date of late 2018. We continue to make progress with initiatives related to our non-regulated commercial portfolio as outlined on Slide 8, the exit of the Midwest merchant generation business is progressing. We are in the final phases of due diligence and expect to announce the winning bidder in the next few months. The closing of any transactions is likely to occur in late 2014 or early 2015. Use of proceeds for this transaction are under evaluation and could include a combination of funding growth investment opportunities, avoiding future holding company financing or a stock buyback. We are committed to redeploying the proceeds in a manner that maximizes shareholder value and expect the transaction to be accretive to our adjusted earnings per share beginning in 2016. We are also making meaningful progress on the evaluation of our international business; we are considering a wide range of options including opportunities for growth as well as tax efficient strategies for utilization of our $1.7 billion in offshore cash. We expect to complete this review late this year or early 2015. Next turning to Slide 10 let me provide an update on Dan River. As you know, we have taken responsibility for the accidental discharge of coal ash in early February and have been working on cleanup activity at the site and the river. Our work at the site and the river has been under the direction of the EPA. Last month, we announced that we have met the EPA's requirements to-date, but we'll continue to monitor the rivers' water quality. Our overall goal is to ensure the long-term health of the river. Cost incurred on cleanup activities were approximately $20 million of the first six months of the year. We do not expect total cleanup cost related to the Dan River incident to be material. We are cooperating with and defending the company in ongoing investigations resulting from the Dan River accident. We have also made progress on our comprehensive plans around the near term and longer term management of each of our coal ash basins. We are committed to developing a scientific engineered solution for each site that will protect the environment and allow us to continue to provide safe, reliable and cost effective electricity for our customers. We expect to finalize the development of comprehensive closure strategies by year-end. Ultimately our plans will need to be in alignment with any final legislation in North Carolina and upcoming federal rules for coal ash, which were expected by the end of the year. Our Ash Basin closure cost will be dependent upon the methodology selected and approved for each site. We will continue to refine our projections for closure cost and provide updates as our plans are finalized. We believe the recoverability of coal ash based in closure cost will be determined by the Carolina's Commission. Next let me provide a brief update on the recent legislative session in North Carolina where the General Assembly introduced legislation addressing the management in closure with Ash Basin. The legislator did not come to an agreement on a compromised bill and adjourned last week. The adjournment resolutions contemplate the coal ash legislation could be considered during a reconvened legislative session later this month or later this year. It's important to highlight, that this delay will not impede our actions or our commitments to working constructively with all parties to continue advancing our comprehensive plans for the long-term management of coal ash in North Carolina. Next let's turn to Slide 11 and our Edwardsport plan in Indiana, which achieved commercial in service in June of last year because Edwardsport is a large and complex project [indiscernible] made it that it would build up to its long-term level of availability over 15 months. I was at the site last month and I'm pleased with the progress as well as the dedication of the plant staff. Plant output and overall performance have steadily improved since early this year. When extreme [indiscernible] or cause operational challenges. May, was the strongest month we have seen for gasification to-date and June was not far behind. In fact, gasification availability during the second quarter was around 75%. July's results were also favorable with gasification availability coming in around 80%. We have completed GE's rigorous performance testing protocol and have validated all major technology systems are working. We are reviewing the test data received from GE and preliminary results were positive. During testing we achieved the nameplate capacity of 618 MW and had encouraging preliminary results on heat wave. The right side of the slide outlines a status of the regulatory proceedings associated with the plant. The Indiana Commission has combined two semi-annual rider updates, IGCC-12 and IGCC-13 and will hold hearings in November. IGCC-11 is fully briefed and we awaiting the commission order. The commission will examine the operational performance of the plant in a normal course of reviewing our semi-annual rider filings, while any replacement power cost resulting from the operational performance for the plant are reviewed in connection with the quarterly fuel cost proceeding. We will continue to update you on our operational progress in these important regulatory milestones. Now I'll turn the call over to Steve to discuss our financial performance for the quarter. Steve Young : Thank you, Lynn. Today I'll focus on three primary areas. First I'll discuss at a high level, the primary drivers to our second quarter results and update you on the status of our earnings guidance range for 2014. Second, I'll discuss our volume trends in the economic conditions within our service territories. Finally, I'll close with our progress toward achieving our overall financial objectives. Let's start with the major second quarter earnings per share drivers as outlined on Slide 12. This morning, we announced 2014 second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share at $1.11, which exceeds 2013 second quarter results of $0.87 per share. We saw higher quarterly earnings at each of our three business segments. As expected, quarterly results were supported by revised customer's rates. Growth in our regulated wholesale business and higher PJM capacity prices. We also experienced favorable weather and a lower effective tax rate during the quarter. As Lynn just mentioned due to the strong results experienced through the first half of the year. We have increased our 2014 adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.05 to $4.50 to $4.65 per share. I will discuss more details on our revised guidance range at the end of my presentation. On a reported basis, the company earned $0.86 during the quarter compared to $0.48 in the second quarter of 2013. A reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results is included the supplemental materials. Adjusted earnings at our regulated utilizes segment increased by $0.13 per share during the quarter. We continue to benefit from increases associated with our 2013 rate cases in the Carolina's an increases from newly contracted wholesale customers. We experienced favorable weather this quarter compared to below normal weather last year in the Carolina's cooling degree days were around 10% higher than average. The utilities experienced lower effective tax rate during the quarter driven by a State tax settlement that resulted in a favorable adjustment to deferred taxes. O&M cost were also favorable during the second quarter. Partially driven by a prior year donation associated with Duke Energy Progress's rate case and benefits from nuclear average cost levelization [ph]. Absent these drivers our cost control efforts have helped us maintained flat O&M compared to last year's quarter. We continue to drive cost out of the business through our merger related initiatives and are targeting flat O&M cost through 2016. International Energy's quarterly results were $0.09 per share higher this year, primarily driven by a $0.07 favorable tax benefit resulting from a reorganization of the company's operation in July. As a result of this benefit, we are lowering our overall consolidated adjusted effective tax rate assumption for 2014 to between 32% and 33%. National Methanol's contribution for the quarter was $0.02 higher than last year primarily due to an extended maintenance outage that occurred in 2013. Commercial Power's adjusted earnings were $0.02 supported by increased wind and solar volumes from new projects coming on line and higher output from existing projects. Higher PJ and capacity prices drove increased results from Midwest Generation. More detailed quarterly earnings drivers for each of our segments are included in today's presentation materials and press release. Before moving on, let me briefly update you on hydro conditions in Brazil. We continue to closely monitor reservoir levels as we have significant contracted hydro capacity. During the second quarter, the rainy season came to an end and reservoir levels remain low. In order to help preserve reservoir level, Brazil's regulatory authorities continue to dispatch thermal generation in anticipation of below normal rainfall and challenging reservoir conditions. We reduced our contracted capacity levels for 2014. This reduction in contracted levels along with higher short-term pricing has helped us to mitigate significant negative financial impacts from the drought, so far this year. Slide 13, highlights our retail customer volume trends for the quarter and the economic conditions within our service territories. Overall weather-normal retail customer load for the quarter, was 0.4% higher than 2013. This was in line with our overall expectations for the year. We evaluate the economic growth of our service territories of the longer term periods; on a rolling 12-month basis weather-normal retail customer load was 1.6% higher. We continue to be encouraged by broad trends in the economy such as higher median household income levels, low unemployment rates and new customer additions. We remained confident in our longer term growth expectation of around 1%. Economic activity is expected to continue expanding over the remainder of the year. In fact, consensus estimates expect GDP growth to be around 3% in the second half of 2014. Employment activity in the states we served continues to improve with unemployment percentages at or below the US average, in four of the six states we serve. In June, approximately 20% of total US non-farm job growth, which from state served by Duke Energy. Next let me highlight some of the trends, we are seeing in each of our customer classes. First; our resident customers with quarter-over-quarter growth was essentially flat. Household income and available credit heavily influenced this customer class. While these indicators have not yet recovered to pre-recessionary levels. They have shown improvement over time. During the quarter, we continue to experience positive growth in the number of customers that our regulated utilities of around 1%. However, usage per customer was unfavorable during the quarter, largely offsetting the growth in the number of customers. Next, our commercial class experienced quarterly growth of 0.5%. Office vacancies and unemployment rates continue to improve leading to growth and retail sales. Continued higher sales were seen in education, health care and hospitality sectors when compared to last year. And finally, the industrial sector experienced growth of 0.8% in the second quarter. We continue to see encouraging strength in the automotive, construction and metal sub sectors. Economic development within our service territories remains active. Our affordable electricity rates help us track businesses to our service territories. Our economic development teams are actively pursuing potential projects within our six-state footprint which could represent up to $10 billion in new investments and over 20,000 jobs. So far this year, several new business relocations and expansions have announced in our service territories representing around $2.5 billion in investments and more than 5,000 new jobs. We are optimistic about the sustainability of the economic recovery across our service territories. Based on the growth that we've experienced over the ruling 12-month basis. The individual quarters may vary, but the longer term economic trends are generally favorable. I will close with our financial objectives for 2014 and the longer term is outlined on Slide 14. These financial objectives have remained consistent over time. We have an established track of achieving each of these objectives. I'm very pleased with our financial performance through the second quarter. To-date we have benefited from revised grades in the regulated businesses, favorable weather, solid growth in sales volumes and favorable impacts of tax rates. Additionally, we continue to drive more efficiencies across the company. We still have our third quarter ahead of us, which is historically our most significant quarter. In July, we experienced mild weather and do not yet know, if that trend will continue into August. We also expect to accelerate the recognition of certain expenses in to 2014. Primarily, a coal unit outage in the Carolina's as well as some cost to advance our coal ash management work. Despite uncertainty with the weather for the third quarter, we are pleased with the strength of our results to-date and increasing our 2014 adjusted EPS guidance range. We will update you on our progress, when we reported our third quarter results in early November. The balance sheet remains strong, the strong affords us the flexibility to invest in our business and grow our dividend without the need for new equity issuances, through 2016. We are focused on growing the dividend, which is central to our investor value proposition. In June, our Board of Directors, approved an approximate 2% increase to our quarterly dividend. This marks the seventh consecutive year of annual dividend increases. We expect to move into our targeted long-term dividend payout ratio range of 65% to 70% in 2014, allowing greater flexibility in future dividend growth. Finally, as Lynn discussed we are focused on executing our growth initiatives as well as our cost management efforts. We are well position to achieve adjusted earnings per share growth within our 4% to 6% target through 2016. Additionally, some of our growth investments provide support for growth beyond 2016. Now I'll turn it back over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Before closing, I thought I would briefly comment on the EPA's recently proposed rules for regulating carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plant. Since issued in June, we have been evaluating this complex rule in engaging with our state regulators. We intent to remain actively engaged in the tool making process. We support policy that will result in reasonable decreases in greenhouse gas emissions overtime, while balancing impacts to our customers, the economies of our service territories and the reliability that our customers count on. We have made significant progress over the last decade in reducing the environmental impact of our generating facilities. We have invested over $9 billion in new generation. Allowing for the retirement of over half of our coal fleet. And our remaining coal units, we've invested over $7 billion on environmental control equipment. As a result, through 2013 we've reduced our carbon emissions by 20% from 2005 levels. Well also achieving two reductions of 84% and NOx reductions of 63% during the same time period. As we engage in this proposed regulation, our comments will focus on ensuring that this progress is recognized and that these investments continue to deliver value to our customers over the remaining useful life. It's important that our customers receive the full benefit of our early actions, not just actions since 2012. The treatment of nuclear both new and existing is also a clear area of focus for us. The complexity of this rule requires careful study and evaluation, not just of each potential building block, but the interaction of all elements together. We expect significant comments as well as legal challenges to the rule and we will remain engaged throughout the development of this important rule making. In closing and we are executing strategy in a thoughtful and disciplined way, that continues to build momentum and deliver value for our customers, communities and shareholders. And we are developing growth opportunities as we position the company for the future. Now I'd like to open the lineup for questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We will now take our first question from Greg Gordon from ISI Group. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group : So, bit of a strategic questions rather than focusing on the quarter because it was clearly, it was a great quarter for you guys, congrats on that. Lynn Good : Thank you. Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group : There's always been this issue, with strategic review of Latin America, which is really like, okay what are we going to do with the money -- back ? But now, you've got the power plant consolidation investment potential further investment in major pipeline, the potential for the necessity of incremental major investments to remediate your ash ponds. So can you talk about how the sort of burgeoning necessity for capital in your core business might change, the way you're looking at, your Latin American business? Lynn Good : Greg, the way I would respond to that is, we've had growth aspirations in the range of the $16 billion to $18 billion to underpin our 4% to 6% growth rate for some time and so we've been analyzing all of our strategic evaluations in the context of positioning the company to grow and so when we talk about, the strategic analysis of international, when we look at decision to strategically outfit the Midwest generation, all of that review has been within the context of better positioning the company to grow and deploy capital in the way, that it adds value. So I would think of all those things together and we will provide you with further updates on our thinking and progress on these initiatives as they occur. Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group : Can you refresh our memories, as to your last public comments on the tax efficiency of bringing back the $1.7 billion? Lynn Good : We haven't made any specific comments, Greg on that item. Let me just maybe give you a little bit of background. We did bring home $700 million in a very tax efficient format, in December of 2013, so that was $700 million basically a basis reduction initiative. We now have a $1.7 billion offshore and we are continuing to look for ways that we can put that cash to use in a tax sufficient manner, so that study is underway as part of the strategic analysis. So you can think of cash utilization supported the dividend and growth is being the three primary objective. Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group : Okay, my last question when you gave the range $0.05 to $0.10 as the annualized earnings impact of the power plant consolidation, what are the financing assumptions that underline that, does that assume sort of debt in equity at sort of consistent with the balance sheet of the Progress Energy Carolina's or some other variable. Lynn Good : So depending on financing structure, it would fall within that range, Greg depending on how much equity is included and how is debt financed. Steve, would you add to that? Steve Young : Yes, I would point out that roughly one half of the purchase price would be finance through Opco debt, so we are talking about roughly $600 million that would be of the equity piece that could be financed through cash or through HoldCo debt, I don't envision the need to issue common equity to deal with this. Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group : Great. Thank you, guys. Lynn Good : Thanks, Greg. Operator : We will now take our next question from Dan Eggers from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse : Just extending maybe little one on Greg's line of question, when we think about 4% to 6% earnings growth range through 2016, I guess when do you think you're going to, maybe reevaluate or maybe put more time horizon on that number and then B, with the pipeline out there, with kind of the redeployment of the money's from NCEMPA and selling commercial generation that sort of stuff, what's going to swing you within the 4% to 6% as you see it right now? Lynn Good : To take the two questions, Dan we will continue to follow our traditional approach on guidance and updated in February, I think we've been in 3-year range for the last couple of years. So that we have provided capital for a 5-year period, so we will continue to update that. I think, the drivers for growth include capital investment and both the regulated business as well as load growth, cost efficiencies, additional renewable growth, which would be both regulated and non-regulated and so, as I think about variables, they can impact earnings over a short or a long-term period. Load growth comes to mind, ability that control cost come to mind and the efficiency and magnitude of capital deployment. Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay and then I guess on the coal ash issue, with the EPA rules, stating out there are kind of variety of different fingers in the pot. When do you think, we are going to finalize to have visibility into full capital obligations or capital expenditures and kind of timeline for putting that capital to work? Lynn Good : The EPA rule that would be [indiscernible] Dan, is expected in December the designation of hazard or non-hazard I believe the timeline for that remains. The plans that we have put forward at this point, have us in a range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion for ash basin closure that's consistent with our historical range of waste disposal updated for the comprehensive plan that we put forward in March. So I think, there are couple of things to watch in terms of refinement of these numbers. One being, we will continue to develop power strategic approach for closure of all of the basins and we are targeting the end of this year. We also have the delay in the legislation in North Carolina, which could be finalized this year that would impact that. And then, I would expect all of these plans to come under review by the regulators in North Carolina over the years to come, which could continue to refine it. So I think, we will reach milestones over 2014 and 2015 for our plants here in the Carolina's and then, it will of course keep you updated as these milestones occur. Steve Young : And I would also add that, the expenditures related to this activity span many, many years. This is well over a decade to deploy these funds. Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay, great and I guess, last question is kind of on load growth. I feel like the last couple of quarters there is more optimism that maybe demand growth is going to sneak above the 1% target you guys have talked about this quarters in the little less enthusiastic unlike for you guys, but across the industry. Can you just talk about trend line and what you're seeing in, if you think the second quarter is more indicative for what you saw, in the preceding quarters is maybe where trend was? Steve Young : Well, Dan you've hit on the challenge of looking at quarterly data. Certainly the first quarter of 2014 was probably heavily influenced by weather. We tried to pull the impact of weather out, but that's as much hard as science. The second quarter, the results were lower in line with our forecast, but when you look at a 12-month rolling average, you see that we are around 1.6% growth. The broad economic indicators continue to improve and we look at unemployment number of customers added in our service territories household, median household incomes, those kind of things. Overall, we do feel like it is improving, but given the volatility that we continue to see quarter-to-quarter we are not ready to move beyond the 1% long-term growth. We will be updating our forecast normally in the fall and see what it looks like then. Dan Eggers \u2013 Credit Suisse : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : We will now take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Firstly, this one question on what you said about the drought in Brazil. Steve, I believe you said you've taken down the sales commitments and that had substantially mitigated what would have been more negative impact. Can you give us a sense of how much of the residual negative that still in the 2014 number as you see it now, if any? And just a bit more some more numbers around what you said that? Steve Young : Well our contracting strategy has paid off benefits so far in the first two quarters of 2014 as we mentioned. We are not in the position to predict, how the final two quarters will come out. We are out of the wet season. The reservoir levels are low, during the low 30% and this is the time of year, where they will decline will come into a new rainy season in the fall and that will be critical to the final results for the year. The contracting strategy of lowering should benefit as well throughout the year, but again it's hard to say where those reservoir levels are going to be and what hydro capacity is going to be available to serve the commitments we have at this time. We'll just have to wait and see. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Through the first two quarters, is it bad to say, your actions mitigated any negative impact or there was still some drag embedded in the numbers? Steve Young : Well, the first two quarters certainly are contracting strategy was beneficial to us and perhaps I'm not understanding your question. I don't know enough to predict the final two quarters. Lynn Good : So Jonathan, what I would add is, we were in line with our expectations for the first two quarters for Brazil and it's the items that Steve talked about, the lower contracting gave us the ability to take advantage of higher spot prices in the first two quarters. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : You kind of ended up about on plan and your comment as you avoided, what you otherwise been a loss. Steve Young : That's true. Lynn Good : For reductions and earnings, yes. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Yes and then secondly, could you comment at all about the recent reports that you'll involved in the late stages of [indiscernible] sale in Colombia, just in the context of your comments about being focused on potential growth avenues in international business? Lynn Good : Jonathan, we are not involved in the late stages of bidding for [indiscernible]. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay, thank you for that and I think, one other thing I just wanted to clarify, you mentioned that NCEMPA transaction is, incremental to 4% to 6% is that more in the sense of, it's incremental beyond 2016 or is that statement more, this could push you above the growth rate in 2016, how should we've going to interpret that? Steve Young : I would think about the NCEMPA investment as giving is confidence in the 4% to 6% growth rate. It's the type of capital the discretionary type capital projects that we are pursuing and certainly this will provide earnings over its life of the wholesale contract with municipalities beyond, but I would say, it gives us confidence in the growth rate. Lynn Good : Jonathan, the incremental comment that we made, its incremental of the capital that we shared with you in February. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. Lynn Good : We've been trying to increase that growth from the $16 billion to the $20 billion by identifying and pursuing these growth initiatives, so this is one of the key ones. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : So that whole Slide 7, should been seen as sort of the difference between $16 billion and $20 billion effect of it? Lynn Good : That's correct. Steve Young : That's correct. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Michael Weinstein from UBS. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS: Hi, good morning. It's Julien here, actually. Lynn Good : Very good. How are you, Julien? Steve Young : How are you, Julien? Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS: I wanted to follow-up on a few items here. First with regards to the pipeline RFP, could you talk a little bit about potential ownership interest and also talk a little bit how that might be structured to what level, you might take that ownership, etc.? Lynn Good : Julien, it's premature to go into any more specifics on this, as we pursue the solicitation. We did pursue of course options, we were looking for transport capacity for the utilities, so were also looking for an ownership interest and so that will be a part of our ongoing discussions as we finalize, this solicitation, but I don't have anything more specific to share at this point. Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS: Fair enough and then moving on to the coal ash side, could you give us a sense, one; where the conversation is today with respect to the total spend versus what you disclosed previously and then secondly as you think about that, how does it compare, what are the key moving parts here as we look towards negotiations in the back half of the year, for total spend? Lynn Good : Julien, you may recall and it's actually in this slide deck as well in the appendix. We put forward a range of spending for North Carolina around the ash basins that began in the left hand side of the chart. I'm referring you to Slide 40 at this point, on the left hand side of the chart representing our historic numbers for waste environmental spending updated for the plans that we put forward in March, 2014 following Dan River. On the right hand side of the page, would be a full excavation of all ash and North Carolina as well as conversion to zero liquid discharge. There are expectations, is that we will end up somewhere in between those two numbers overtime and as I shared in the comments earlier in the call. Those final estimates will be revised as closure strategy and the methods are developed and approved. Right now based on the commitments that we've made, I would say we are in the range of the 2 to 2.5, but these numbers will be refined as additional work, engineering, science, approvals, etc proceed. Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS: All right, thank you and then moving back to the international side, if you don't mind. Could you talk a little bit more about how to make any potential transaction accretive? And specifically what I'm getting at is how do you think about potential partnerships and driving synergies out of any deal? Perhaps is there an opportunity used the offshore cash back to invest in the growth as a way to perhaps transform the business. Lynn Good : I will say, all options are on the table, when we do a review of this sort looking for ways, that we can streamline the business, looking for ways we can drive growth, optimize cash, etc. so I would say all options are on the table at this point and as we progress and reach final conclusions will of course provide an update. We are targeting end of 2014, early 2015 at this point. Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS: And just to be clear, a little nuance there, does the current hydrological situation drive timing or consideration of transaction etc? Lynn Good : No. Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS: Okay, excellent. Well thank you very much. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Just a couple of questions about the good all fashion regulated side of house. When you think about rate cases, over the next year? What new ones do you anticipate filing across the system? Steve Young : Michael, in terms of looking at our rate cases, we had a lot of activity in 2013 in the Carolina's and Ohio as well. So we don't have any base rate cases planned for a while. Our settlement in Florida, sets up a lot of trackers for significant cost, but keeps us out of base rates for a while. So we don't have any plans through 2016 for base rate increases. We may look at our Duke Energy Progress, South Carolina jurisdiction as a potential area. We'll keep an eye on that, but nothing in the near term given all the activity that we concluded in 2013. Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Got it. One other questions and this is about the potential new projects would you developed down in Florida as well as the NCEMPA acquisition you've disclosed. One the Florida one, there is a lot of opposition to those developments because there still is, Florida is one of the States, where there are still a lot of non-regulated merchant, combined cycles and peekers [ph] kind of hanging around, guys who are obviously willing to sell into a utility either RFP or actually sell the asset to a utility like yours. Just curious in terms of how you think regulators will look at that option, with kind of the cost benefit analysis and also if you can address on the NCEMPA process there was a lot of going back to the progress merger, there was a lot of back and forth with the FERC bell [ph] potential market power issues in the Carolina's, how would think acquisition kind of screen in terms of market power in the Carolina's? Lynn Good : Taking both of those, Michael on Florida. I think you've raised a key question on whether or not the investments that we've put forward represent the lowest cost option for customers and that will be the center piece of the regulatory review in August. We believe that, the process that we've undertaken, which include in RFP for the Citrus County combined cycle will support that what we put forward is the lowest option, but I think that will be the center piece of the regulatory proceeding that will occur, this month continuing through the final approval process. On market power, we report very closely at this. We do not see a market power issue with the NCEMPA transaction. A couple of things I would note, is we are acquiring generation and load of a comparable amount. So we are not acquiring excess generation and the fact, that we already operate these units has us in a position, where the dispatch of the units will not change as a part of the acquisition. So those are both, we believe key considerations in the market power analysis. Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Got it. Thanks, Lynn. Much appreciated. Operator : We will take our next question from Jim [indiscernible] from TRT Capital. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : I've got a couple of simple questions. One is on the dividend, I know you have this targeted 65% to 70% payout ratio, but as I do some of that math. It seems like you still have a little bit of room to grow above the 2%, what do you think about raising the dividend better than the 2% that you have been doing thus far? Steve Young : Well, as we've said understand the value of the dividend to our overall proposition. We are now moving into our target range, we've been above at for a while. But that gives us as we've said, as time goes forward. We can continue to earn as we should, that should give us more flexibility and we will certain be looking at increasing the dividend growth rate. Ideally, we would like to get more in line with our earnings growth rate, but it remains to be seen when and how that happens. Unidentified Analyst : The second quick question is, on the 4% to 6%, thank you for the answer. Second question is one the 4% to 6% growth rate. Can you just refresh our memory is to what, is the base year on that, is it 2013? Steve Young : Yes, it's the midpoint of the projected earnings range for 2013. Unidentified Analyst : Right, okay and then last question, is on your Slide number 4, you talk about the new growth investments is $16 to $20 billion over this period through 2018, one of which buckets is new generation is $6 billion to $8 billion, but if just add the numbers up, on the Florida combined cycle lead and the renewable everything, I come up to a number that's less than $6 billion, how should I think about that remaining $2.3 billion or so, to get to that high end of that $8 billion range, so that place hold is that you're just not ready to talk about publicly at this point in time? Steve Young : Well, I think you can think about our businesses as a whole and kind of zero in on some things. We are going to need to build some new facilities in the Carolina's to meet load growth in the back end of the year, at 1.5% peak load growth, you're going to be growing 300 MW, 400 MW is the Carolina's every year. So every couple of years, you're going to need combined cycles or at least simple cycle CTs in the Carolina's. So there is a fair amount of generation that's going to come in that area, as well. So that will fill a lot of that gap there. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, so the gap is accounted for, it's not something that we should be looking for in subsequent announcements, is what you're saying? Steve Young : That's correct and also some other categories of spin that are in the total number compliance with EPA regulations. A lot of math work to be done in the next few years and a lot of nuclear related expenditures particularly related to Fukushima. So there is a number of those types of investments that help fill out the portfolio. Unidentified Analyst : Understand. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Kit Konolige from BGC Financial. Please go ahead. Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Capital : Couple of kind of scattered questions. First the sale of Midwest gen, you're obviously aware that DPL withdrew their plans from the market. Does that affect what you're doing at all? Lynn Good : No, Kit. Our process is been part of a strategic evaluation that we undertook at the end of last year continuing into this year and so we are moving forward with our decision, don't have any specific milestones to announce, except to say that process is continuing and we expect to close later this year or early 2015. Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Capital : Right and how about on the North Carolina pipeline, can you give us any detail of timing on that? Lynn Good : No, we expect to finalize the review of the solicitation within the next few weeks, Kit and would make an announcement at that time. Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Capital : Okay, so that's obviously in \u2013 and how should we understand Lynn both with regard to the pipeline and to renewable investments? How should we assess Duke's degree of interest in either of those? I mean, are either of those areas going to become a major business segment or this one off type of investments? Lynn Good : We think about the pipeline into North Carolina, is a very strategic investment for the company, Kit. We see it's being strategic not only the state of North Carolina but to electric supply and the State of North Carolina, as we continue to add gas. I think this will give us an important entry into pipeline and if you think back to the Spectra spin, Duke has had a history of interest in pipeline investment, but I'm not foreshadowing any strategic shift, what we'll focus on at this point is the North Carolina investment. I would say, the renewable have been a part of our story sometime. We continue to add to our commercial renewable business, as well as introducing renewables in our regulated jurisdiction. We see that as an increasingly important part of the portfolio and I think we mentioned in the call, that we have 400 MW of wind and 100 MW of solar under construction right now in support of our commercial businesses. Another 300 MW of solar, that we're negotiating under an RFP and North Carolina. So I would expect to see additional renewable investment in the years to come. Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Capital : All right and finally, in Florida, Steve you were talking about no red cases in the near future and so on, what I assume you're keeping an eye on the political situation down there. What would it do for your regulatory outlook in Florida, if Charlie Crist made another stunning come back here and became Governor again. Lynn Good : You know, Kit that's a difficult question. We have to work with all stakeholders and all legislators, governors in our jurisdiction. So we are focused on running our businesses as well as we possibly can, we're also focused on making investments for the long-term value that we can deliver to our customers and we watch politics much like you do. Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC Capital : As a spectator sport, that's how I watch it. I don't know about \u2013 obviously it's more important for you. All right, thank you very much Operator : We will now take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates : Just a some really quick ones, a lot of my questions have been answered, but the growth avenues, Jonathan asked you about specific potential acquisition, but I'm just wondering whether or not there is anything in general that you guys might be interested in or that you could share with us, that some general area that you guys might be, that sort of opened up, that you guys might be pursuing or? Lynn Good : Are you referring to international? Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates : Yes, I'm sorry, yes I'm referring to international to growth, I'm sorry. Yes. Lynn Good : Yes, we don't have a specific project that we'd point you to, one of the underpinning of the strategic review as we see headwinds in Latin America from currency and potential re-pricing that puts us in a position where the growth rate isn't as strong, as we like it to be. So we are undertaking the strategic review to look at all elements including growth and efficiency and utilization of cash, but we don't have any specific project that we would draw attention to today. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates : Okay and then with respect to the coal ash legislation. There seem to be to sort of competing bills that were sort of buying for against one and another and I was just wondering, if there was any things, that we might have in terms of and I have realized that obviously, those are two potential outcomes and there could be obviously another outcome that could happen or not outcome I guess. I know you guys are working at, regardless you guys are sort of aggressively pursuing the cold ash situation, but how should we think about those potentials outcomes, I guess and what potential impact, it may or may not have on your projected growth rate, in earnings? Lynn Good : Paul, what I would say is that the either the legislature has been delayed, I think it's difficult for us to speculate at this point about, either the timing of reconvening or the scope and approach of the legislature would take. I do think, there is a strong commitment on the part of General Assembly to get the legislation right and so they're being deliberate and thoughtful in their process. And we have given you some broad parameters around, how we think about the potential cost and the other things that I would indicate that you should keep in mind, with all of the ash, if this is going to play over a number of years. So even if you look at the existing profile of this Senate and House bills, there were targets over five years and 10 years and 15 years over deployment would be an over a very long period of time. So that's all I would say at this point and will of course keep you informed as progress occurs. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates : Well, is it safe to say perhaps that within your, reach [ph] that you've given these outcomes would probably be within that range regardless of which one would happen or does that make sense, you got what I'm saying? Lynn Good : Paul, I think you know getting back to this range of cost that we've included on Slide 40, so we have $2.5 million and this is just North Carolina, $2.5 million on one and $10 billion on another end. So the more expedition of ash, that could arrive will increase the cost. Again, timeframe is important five years, 10 years, 15 years to accomplish that. So I don't think, based on where we are right now. We can't give you any more specifics on, where we think it will end up, the legislation is been delayed and we will have more to report as it progresses. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates : Okay, fair enough and I don't mean to focus too much on, but it seem to be, a lot of these costs would be rate peer oriented cost, right? Lynn Good : We believe that cost recovery for ash is under the review of the Carolina's commission, but that again is something that would be addressed over time. Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : And we will now take our final question from Ali Agha from SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Just wanted to clarify couple of comments, you made earlier. First off, Steve for planning purposes that 32% to 33% tax rate in 2014, should we assume roughly the same in the next couple of years as well? Steve Young : No, I wouldn't try to be that precise as we go forward. We'll have to take allot each year at what's in front of us in terms of our tax optimization strategies and we'll give that year-by-year as we have in the past. Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : I see, so directionally though it could go up or down, is the way to think about it? Steve Young : Well, it could yes, it could move, I don't think it would move dramatically either up or down, but I don't have any insight as to which direction, it might move at this point. Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Got it and Lynn, just to be clear maybe you've said that and I may have missed that, but in your international review of all the options you're looking at, is a complete exit from international one of the options or is that off that table? Lynn Good : I said before Ali, that all options are on the table, but as we approach the strategic review. We did not approach it with exited mind. We approached it, with an objective of trying to optimize the portfolio to pursue cash and more efficient use of cash and growth. So we always look at everything but, more to come as we complete our work and targeting end of this year or early next. Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Got it and my last question, also just to clarify, when you talk about exiting the merchant and using the proceeds and so net impact being accretive, is that net impact embedded in the 4% to 6% or could that be upside assuming everything goes as plan? Lynn Good : It contemplated in the range, Ali if you look at, I believe it would have been in first quarter. It's also on Slide 45 of this quarter's deck, you'll see sort of the makeup how we get to 4% to 6% and redeployment of proceeds is potential item to consider. Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : I will now turn the call back to Lynn Good for closing comments. Lynn Good : So thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to our third quarter call in early November and seeing many of you at the fall conference end of BEI [ph], so thanks again. Operator : This does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation.",

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy\u2019s third quarter 2014 earnings review and business update. Today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the Safe Harbor statement which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today\u2019s materials. Please note that the appendix to today\u2019s presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures to help you analyze the company\u2019s performance. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, President and CEO, along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. After our prepared we will take your questions. Other members of the executive team will be available during this portion of the call. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. Earlier today, we released third quarter adjusted earnings results of $1.40 per share. These results are impacted by milder than normal weather, unfavorable results in Latin America and weaker retail load compared to the prior year quarter. Our year-to-date results remain above our internal plan, and we remain on track to achieve a revised 2014 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.50 per share to $4.65 per share. Steve will provide more about the financials in a moment. Let me spend a few minutes on operational performance and progress and how we are positioning our business for growth. Our regulated nuclear fleet set a record quarterly capacity factor of 98% in the third quarter. Our regulated natural gas fleet also performed well achieving at least 80% capacity factor at eight of our nine combined cycle plans in the Carolinas and Florida. We also continued to deliver significant benefit from the 2012 merger with Progress Energy. Through the third quarter, we generated about $360 million of cumulative fuel and joint dispatch savings for our Carolinas customers. We are on track to achieve to guaranteed savings of $687 million over the first five years. By the end of this year, we expect to deliver non-fuel O&M savings of about $550 million, exceeding our original assumptions. It has been an active and successful quarter in advancing our strategy. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 4, and several of our growth initiative announcements during the third quarter, including new generation and new gas and electric infrastructure. I\u2019ll briefly summarize a few of our key announcements. In September Duke and Piedmont Natural Gas announced a joint venture with Dominion and AGL Resources, to build and operate the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The 550 mile natural gas pipeline begins in West Virginia and runs through Virginia and into Eastern North Carolina. Duke will have 40% ownership interest in this project through our commercial business. The pipeline has a total construction cost estimates of between $4.5 billion and $5 billion. The pipeline is over 90% subscribed and a binding open season for the remaining firm transportation capacity is currently underway. Our regulated subsidiaries in the Carolinas will enter into 20-year gas transportation agreements with a pipeline. The Utilities Commissions in both North and South Carolina have approved our regulated subsidiaries entering into these agreements. Since the announcement the project has received broad support. Over 5,000 letters have been received across the project\u2019s three state regions voicing support for the pipeline. An independent study estimates that the project can generate a total of $2.7 billion, an economic impact by 2019, supporting over17,000 jobs. The project requires FERC approval, which the joint venture will seek to secure by the summer of 2016. Last week, Dominion on behalf of the joint venture submitted a pre-filing with FERC, which begins the extensive review process. Construction is expected to be completed in late 2018. Secondly, we plan to invest in our transmission and distribution infrastructure in Indiana. In August, we filed a seven-year $1.9 billion grid modernization plan with the Indiana commission, under legislation recently enacted. The plan uses advanced technology and infrastructure upgrades to improve service to our Indiana customers. Hearings are set for December, with the decision expected in the second quarter of 2015. As highlighted on our last earnings call, we finalized an agreement for the $1.2 billion purchase of the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency\u2019s minority ownership in existing nuclear and coal generation. This transaction provides significant benefits. The proceeds will allow the Power Agency\u2019s cities to reduce their customers\u2019 rate and debt burden. Duke Energy Progress customers will also benefit from long-term cost savings and increased fuel diversity. Last month we filed for FERC approval of the asset purchase agreement and the 30-year full-requirement wholesale agreement with the power agency. Under the agreement the transaction must be completed by the end of 2016. In September, we announced plans to commit $500 million to solar expansion in North Carolina. This supports compliance with the state\u2019s renewable portfolio standard. In addition to signing power purchase agreements with five new solar projects for 150 megawatts, we will acquire and construct three solar facilities totaling 128 megawatts. We have filed with the North Carolina Utilities Commission for approval to transfer the Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity for the facilities to be acquired. These important growth initiatives support our ability to continue providing our customers affordable reliable energy from increasingly diverse generation portfolio, as well as providing a solid foundation for our long-term earnings growth rate of 4% to 6%. Now let me turn to Slide 5, which summarizes our new generation projects in the Carolinas and Florida. Overall, these projects will replace generating capacity that has or will be retired. And will help us meet the long-term load growth in our service territory. These projects represent around 3,000 megawatts of capacity and almost $3 billion of investments through 2018.  : Site certification approval for Citrus County is expected in late 2015. We continued to evaluate our options for additional capacity in Florida. We are negotiating with Calpine on the potential purchase of their Osprey combined-cycle plant. We\u2019re also continuing to evaluate the addition of 320 megawatts of peaking capacity at our Suwannee facility. We expect to ultimately move forward with one of these options. We will keep you apprised of our plans as we finalize our evaluation and make filings with the Florida Commission later this year or early next year. A potential Osprey acquisition would also require FERC approval. Turning to Slide 6, I\u2019ll provide an update on coal ash management activities during the third quarter. In August the North Carolina legislation passed the Coal Ash Management Act of 2014, which became law in September. This law requires closure of all coal ash basins in the state within 15 years, while preserving the ability to make site-specific closure decisions based on science and engineering. It also establishes the nine member of Coal Ash Management Commission to oversee implementation of the law. It requires the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources to evaluate and issue a proposed classification for all wash basins as either high, intermediate or low risk by the end of 2015. The law designates the ash basins of Dan River, Asheville, Riverbend and Sutton as high priority and requires them to be closed no later than August 1, 2019. We have begun developing excavation plans, permitting applications and other work at these four sites. We will be filing our excavation plans for these four sites with NC DENR later this month. In a moment, Steve will provide an update on the accounting implications of the law. During the quarter, we also took proactive steps to advance our coal ash management program. First, we announced the new centralized internal organization to manage all coal combustion products. We also announced the formation of the National Coal Ash Management Advisory Board, a panel of nine independent experts from fields such as engineering, waste management, environmental science, and risk analysis. This panel will help guide our strategy for permanent ash storage and base enclosure. Before, updating you on Edwardsport, let me provide some comments, on the EPA\u2019s proposed rule for regulating carbon-dioxide emission from existing power plants. Since issued in June, we continue to evaluate the rule and engage with our state regulators. We are developing comments and plan to submit them to EPA by the revised deadline. We have made significant progress over the last decade in reducing the environmental impact of our generating facilities. We\u2019ve invested over $9 billion in building new state-of-the-art plants, as well as $7.5 billion in environmental controls. These investments have resulted in CO2 emission reductions of more than 20% below 2005 levels, as well as significant SO2 and NOx emission reductions. It is important that the rule recognize these investments for the benefit of our customers. Our comments will focus on the composition and achievability of the four building blocks as well as the interaction between the building blocks. We are also focused on the pace and timing of the required reductions, specifically the interim date requirements and the potential impact on system reliability. Nuclear is an important part of our generation fleet in the Carolinas, the appropriate treatment of existing and new nuclear generation in goal setting and compliance will also be an important area of focus. We expect the rule will receive a significant volume of comments as well as legal challenges. We will continue to keep you updated on our thoughts on this rule making as it evolves over the coming months. Next, let\u2019s turn to Slide 7, in our Edwardsport plant in Indiana, which achieved commercial and service in June of last year. We have completed GE\u2019s rigorous performance testing protocol and have validated that all major technology systems are working. To achieve substantial completion of the contract with the GE, we are finalizing the plants ramp rate performance, which we expect to complete later this year. Planned output and overall performance has improved during the year. Gasification availability averaged 75% during the second quarter and 70% during the third quarter, including a planned maintenance outage to begin in September. Gasification availability exceeded 90% during the critical months of July and August. This plan is well-positioned to reliably serve our Indiana customers for decades to come. The right side of the Slide outlines the status of the regulatory proceedings associated with the plant. IGCC-11 is fully briefed and we are awaiting a commission order. The commission will hold hearings on IGCC-12 and IGCC-13 in February. Orders are expected for all three pending proceedings in the first-half of 2015. The commission will examine the operational performance of the plant in the normal course of reviewing our semi-annual writer filings. Any Edwardsport IGCC-related fuel costs are reviewed in connection with the quarterly fuel costs proceeding. We will continue to update you on these important regulatory milestones. Before turning the call over to Steve, let me update you on the sale of our non-regulated Midwest generation business to Dynegy for $2.8 billion in cash. As outlined on Slide 8, we expect to close the transaction by the end of the first quarter of 2015. The closing date will depend on the timing of approvals including FERC, Department of Justice, and our release from certain credit support obligations. The use of proceeds for this transaction remains under evaluation and will be determined as we approach the closing. Proceeds could be deployed in a combination of funding growth investments, avoiding future holding company financings or a stock buyback. We are committed to maximizing shareholder value and expect the transaction to be accretive to our adjusted EPS beginning in 2015 or 2016, depending on the closing date and how the proceeds are redeployed. We will keep you updated in our progress in the coming months. Overall, in looking back at everything we have accomplished so far this year, I am pleased with how we are executing our business plans, advancing growth initiatives, strengthening our operational performance and delivering reliable service to our customers. We look forward to a strong finish to 2014. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve to discuss our financial performance for the quarter. Steven Young : Thanks, Lynn. Today, I\u2019ll focus on four areas : first, the primary drivers of our third quarter results; second, our retail volume trends and the economic conditions within our service territories; third, important accounting changes made in the third quarter; and finally, I will close with our financial objectives including the status of our 2014 adjusted earnings guidance range. Let\u2019s start with the major earnings drivers for the quarter, as outlined on Slide 9. Our quarterly adjusted diluted EPS $1.40 was below the prior year\u2019s quarterly results of $1.46 per share. As we discussed during our last earnings call we expected slightly higher adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter, compared to last year. However, adjusted earnings this quarter were hampered by three principal drivers. First, weather was below normal by around $0.06 per share. Additionally, unfavorable results at International Energy and lower retail customer load growth also contributed to reduced third quarter earnings. Overall, based on the strength of the first two quarters we remain on track to achieve our revised 2014 adjusted earnings guidance range of $4.50 to $4.65 per share. On a reported basis, we earned a $1.80 during the quarter compared to $1.42 last year. Reported results include an approximate $475 million pre-tax reversal of a first quarter impairment charge related to the sale of our Midwest generation business. This impairment reversal is recorded in discontinued operations and has been excluded from the company\u2019s adjusted diluted earnings per share results. Next, let me discuss the key quarterly earnings drivers for each of our major segments. I\u2019ll start with our largest segment, Regulated Utilities, where adjusted earnings were essentially flat during the quarter. For the second summer in a row we experienced mild weather compared to normal. However, the weather this quarter was normal than last year, driving favorable quarter-over-quarter results. Cooling degree days were around 10% below normal in the Carolinas and almost 30% below normal in the Midwest. Other favorable drivers included higher pricing, primarily associated with our 2013 rate cases at Duke Energy Carolinas and a favorable effective tax rate. These impacts were offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense primarily associated with the new assets in the rate base and lower retail customer volumes. We also entered into a fuel settlement this quarter offsetting the benefit of revised rates at Duke Energy progress. Cost control efforts have helped us achieve flat non-fuel O&M when compared to last year\u2019s quarter. We are driving costs out of the business through our merger related initiatives. International Energy\u2019s quarterly results were $0.05 per share lower this year primarily driven by higher purchased power cost in Brazil resulting from core hydrology. We also had an unplanned outage at one of our hydro facilities in Chile. This outage has been resolved and the unit is currently online. As you will recall we operate hydro generation plants in Brazil that are dependent upon adequate reservoir levels to generate electricity. In 2014 Brazil has experienced the most severe drought in around 80 years and reservoir levels are at near historic lows. In response to the draught Brazil\u2019s regulatory authorities are dispatching thermal generation at full capacity. In anticipation of below normal rainfall and challenging hydrological conditions we\u2019ve reduced our contracted capacity levels for 2014 and have taken similar actions for 2015. We will closely monitor reservoir conditions as we move through the fourth quarter and enter 2015. Commercial Power\u2019s adjusted earnings were $0.05 per share higher, primarily driven by increased earnings at the Midwest generation business. Midwest generation was supported by higher PJM capacity prices which increased from $28 per megawatt day in the prior year to up $126 per megawatt day currently. The other segment variance was primarily driven by a favorable prior year state deferred tax adjustment. More detailed quarterly adjusted earnings drivers for each of our segments are included in today\u2019s presentation materials and press release. Moving on to slide 10, I\u2019ll now discuss our retail customer volume trends. In the third quarter of 2013 we experienced strong retail load growth of 1.7%, a challenging level from which to grow period-over-period. As we saw in the first quarter of 2014 adjusting for weather can be imprecise especially over shorter periods of time. For these reasons we find low growth trends more meaningful when evaluated over a longer term period. Through the third quarter weather normal retail load was 0.7% higher on both a year-to-date and a rolling 12 month basis. This is ahead of our full year expectations of 0.5% growth. We continue to see growth in the industrial class. In fact this was the sixth consecutive quarter of growth in this sector. Results in our commercial and residential sectors have been more volatile. Based upon historic trends we believe the consistent growth we have seen in industrial will expand to the other sectors as the economic recovery gains more solid footing. Let me briefly highlight some of the recent trends we are monitoring in each major customer class. First, the industrial sector, where sales grew 0.6% over the rolling 12 months. We have experienced recent weakness in our Duke Energy Progress territory where sales continue to be negatively impacted by two chemical plant closures late last year. Outside of Duke Energy Progress industrial activity in our other jurisdictions remained strong with overall growth of around 2% over the rolling 12 months. The Midwest and Duke Energy Carolinas jurisdictions continue to see strength in the metals, chemicals and transportation sub-sectors. Building product manufacturers have also shown recent strength. Next the commercial sector where sales grew 1.1% over the past 12 months. Overall, this sector continues to benefit from recent strength in the healthcare, education and government areas across all jurisdictions. This strength has also been supported by positive long-term employment trends. Turning to slide 11, I\u2019ll provide some insight into our residential sector, which has experienced 0.5% growth during the rolling 12 month period. As you can see in the chart the total number of customers in our jurisdiction continues to grow consistently by around 1%. We experienced 1.5% growth in Florida, 1% growth in the Carolinas and around 0.5% growth in the Midwest. However, volatile customer usage trends effect overall residential load growth. Customer usage can be impacted by energy efficiency and conservation efforts, changes in median household income, unemployment trends and rising demand for multi-family housing. Overall, we continue to be cautiously optimistic about the future based upon the broad trends in the economy. The economic expansion is projected to continue with GDP expected to grow at nearly 3% for the remainder of 2014. Employment activity in the states we serve remains generally favorable with unemployment rates at or below the national average. To-date in 2014 approximately 20% of U.S. non-foreign job growth is in states served by Duke Energy, particularly in the manufacturing and construction sectors. Our affordable electricity rates continue to attract businesses to our service territories. Our economic development teams are actively pursuing potential projects within our six state footprint. So far this year several new business relocations and expansions have been announced in our service territories, representing around $3 billion in investments and more than 9,500 new jobs. Based on the retail sales growth we\u2019ve experienced over the rolling 12 months and the underlying favorable economic forecasts we remain confident in our longer term growth expectation of around 1%. We expect individual quarters to vary but the longer term economic trends are generally favorable. Let me spend a moment discussing two important accounting matters that occurred during the third quarter as outlined on slide 12. First, accounting rules require the recognition of an asset retirement obligation or ARO liability of approximately $3.4 billion as a result of the passage of coal ash legislation in North Carolina in September. This obligation has been capitalized on the balance sheet as property plant and equipment for active sites and those are regulatory [assets] for retire sites. The ARO is based upon a discounted probability weighted assessment of various ash basin closure methodologies costs and timelines. The ultimate cost will rely on the sites specific risk classifications and closure methodologies approved by Dinah and the Coal Ash Management Commission as well as the anticipated federal rules for coal ash. We will update the ARO as closure plans continue to evolve. We also had two accounting implications related to the sale process of the Midwest generation business. As you may recall in the first quarter we\u2019ve recognized a pretax impairment of $1.4 billion based upon the estimated fair market value of the assets. Our agreement to sell the Midwest generation business to Dynegy for $2.8 billion is higher than our original estimated fair value. Therefore, we have reversed around $475 million of the previously recognized impairment in the third quarter. This reversal is recorded in discontinued operations and has been excluded from our adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter. As a result of the Dynegy agreement, our Midwest generation business now meets the accounting criteria to be classified as discontinued operations for GAAP reported purposes. As we announced at the commencement of the sale process the earnings from this business will continue to be included in our adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2014. Despite the mild third quarter weather and poor Brazilian hydrology we are ahead of plan for the year. We are confident in our ability to achieve our revised 2014 adjusted earnings guidance range of $4.50 to $4.65 per share. This range implies fourth quarter adjusted earnings between $0.80 and $0.95 per share. Slide 13 outlines the key drivers to consider when evaluating our expectations the lower earnings per share in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year. Many of these drivers are consistent with what we have encountered during the year. Let me briefly discuss a few of the drivers that may not be as intuitive. First, we do not expect a significant quarter-over-quarter variance for revised customer rates as our prior year rate cases were all in effect for the entire portion of the last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Related to the 2013 rate case activity we expect a negative driver in the fourth quarter due to the implementation of nuclear average cost levelization in late 2013. You might recall we realized $0.11 of favorable earnings per share in 2013 mostly in the fourth quarter as well implemented this accounting treatment. This year we expect about $0.05 to $0.06 of a lower benefit in the fourth quarter. We also expect lower results in Latin America, principally driven by the impacts of drought condition in Brazil and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Finally we expect a higher effective tax rate in the fourth quarter than the 31% we recognize last year. We anticipate the full year adjusted effective tax rate of 32% to 33%. Slide 14 highlights the building blocks of our long term adjusted earnings growth objectives of between 4% to 6% through 2016. The left side of these slides shows the components of our base plan which supports an adjusted earnings per share growth of around 4%. This base plan is underpinned by around $3 billion in annual growth investment and assumes modest retail and wholesale loan growth coupled with effective cost management. Lynn outlined the progress that we\u2019ve made this quarter advancing our incremental growth opportunities, including the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the NCEMPA asset purchase. These incremental opportunities along with [low] growth in excess of 0.5% and optimization of our commercial portfolio give us confidence in our ability to achieve our targeted 4% to 6% adjusted earnings per share growth objective through 2016. Slide 15 outlines our financial objectives for 2014 and beyond. These objectives have remained consistent overtime and we have an established track record in achieving each of these objectives. We are on track to achieve our 2014 revised guidance range and our long-term adjusted earnings growth objective. We are also focused on the dividend, which is central to our investor value proposition. During the third quarter we increased our dividend by 2%. This was the seventh consecutive year we have increased the dividend. We expect to move into our targeted long-term dividend payout ratio of 65% to 70% this year providing additional flexibility going forward. Our balance sheet and credit ratings remain strong allowing us to invest in our business without the need for new equity issuances through 2016. As we normally do in February we will provide our updated financial plans to 2015 and beyond. Now I will turn it back over to Lynn. Lynn Good : In closing the third quarter demonstrated significant positive momentum in delivering value for our customers, communities and shareholders. And we are laying a strong groundwork and foundation for the future. Now we welcome your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll go first to Julien Dumoulin Smith from UBS. Julien Dumoulin Smith \u2013 UBS: Hi, Good morning. Steven Young : Hi, good morning. Lynn Good : Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin Smith \u2013 UBS: Thanks, first question on the ARO and the overall CapEx OpEx composition of potential spend with the coal ash, could you just give a little bit of flavor around how much this could turn into an earnings opportunity in whatever parameters you can describe? Steven Young : Well, we have recorded at this point the ARO liability and while we have not begun to spend any significant funds we will begin spending that money in 2015 as we identify four plans that we are going on pretty quickly. Our focus right now is getting these plans approved, getting the permitting done, getting the logistics in place. The ultimate cash spend will be impacted by the decisions made by Dinah and the coal ash commission regarding many of the sites. Ultimately the cost recovery aspect has been kicked to the Utilities Commission. We have made no application for recovery because we haven\u2019t incurred any cost. So ultimately the dispositions of that into customer rates is yet to be decided. Julien Dumoulin Smith \u2013 UBS: Fair enough. Then turning to the international business I\u2019d be curious where do you stand in the strategic review and specifically does the latest hydrological developments in Brazil impacts that review in any sense and really what\u2019s on the table at this point as the process continues? Lynn Good : So we are continuing to review all options and had set an internal timeline of late \u201814 early \u201815 for our review and we are on pace for that Julien. I wouldn\u2019t say specifically that the hydrology in the year of 2014 is impacting that review, but certainly hydrologic risk, regulatory risk, market risk and opportunities are part of what we are assessing. So when we reach any important milestone in that review we will certainly update you but at this point Julien I don\u2019t have anything further to discuss. Julien Dumoulin Smith \u2013 UBS: Great and then if you will, just turning to Florida quickly, [Necter] has talked about some other opportunities potentially adding solar in the state, gas reserves, I\u2019d be curious what\u2019s your thought process on pursuing those avenues as well? Lynn Good : At this point our focus is on the significant generation build that we have underway to replace capacity in the states that we are focused as we remarked in our comments on combined cycle upgrades and adding additional capacity. We certainly believe that solar represents an opportunity for the State of Florida as it makes sense for public policy and requirements of our customers and we will pursue that at the right time but I would say our focus at this point is on the gas capacity. Julien Dumoulin Smith \u2013 UBS: Great, well thank you very much. Lynn Good : Thank you. Steven Young : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group : Good morning. Lynn Good : Good morning, Greg. Steven Young : Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group : Going back to page seven on Edwardsport can you review the dollars that are being reviewed for recovery in the rider proceedings and what the risk is f the commission were to decide that you weren\u2019t performing up to their expectations? Lynn Good : Greg, I think, we can take you offline on the specific dollars in each of the filings and the team would be ready to do that as soon as the call over. Let me just give you some color generally about the proceeding. So the commission would be taking up IGCC-12 and 13 in February. They will be focusing on the operating results of the plant. There have been challenges by certain of the interveners during November of 2013 around the concept of negative generation when the plant was down and was drawing power from the grid. We also have discussed previously that we had some challenges during January with freezing 30 degree normal in Indiana we would expect the commission to be reviewing operating activities during that period. So I think between the IGCC filing as well as fuel there will be a comprehensive review of operations and our focus has been on continuing to improve performance and I think the demonstrated results that we shared on the call with 90% availability for the gas supplier in July and August and the overall capacity factors demonstrate that we\u2019re moving in the right direction. Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group : Thanks I will get them offline. That\u2019s all I got, thanks. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : And we will go next to Steven Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Good morning. Steven Young : Good morning, Steve. Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley : I wanted to discuss your tax position and your Latin American assets. Apparently we don\u2019t know where you\u2019ll ultimately come out in terms of your strategic review but if you were to think about selling assets and repatriating the money back to the US, can you discuss your tax position at a high level, I know you have a large US tax loss position, just curious how we should broadly think about tax implications if you were to try to repatriate a fairly large amount of capital from Latin America? Steven Young : Okay, let\u2019s look at the cash on hand. We\u2019ve got about $1.6 million overseas offshore right now. If we were to make an assertion that all of the previous earnings were to be repatriated over time, we would record a tax liability in the ballpark of $300 million to $350 million. We have not accrued any U.S. taxes on the international operations, but if we said all the past earnings were going to ultimately repatriate, that\u2019s what we would record on our books. Now because of our current NOL position and under the current tax laws with the expiration of bonus depreciation, we would expect to come out of the NOL in 2015 and start utilizing tax credits. We would not be a significant tax payer until 2016 or 2017. So the actual cash outlays related to income taxes on our international operations wouldn\u2019t be made for a few years down the road. Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. So you do essentially, Steve, get some benefit from that tax loss position that you had when you think about bringing capital back, but there is still an accrual, there is still some degree of cash costs when you bring that money back? Steven Young : Yes, that\u2019s correct. We have both the accrual to catch-up taxes on all the previous earnings, and then the actual cash outlays would be a bit later. Lynn Good : And so the GAAP accounting or the generally accepted accounting principles require recognition of liability, Stephen, but the cash payment would occur, as Steve indicated, after the NOL is absorbed and we move through the utilization of renewable credits and so on. Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley : I see. But if you were to try to bring the capital back, let\u2019s say in late 2015, would your tax loss position allow for some degree of a shield of the cash that would be coming back from Latin America? Steven Young : I\u2019d have to look back at the numbers more closely, but I believe there would be some tax shield there for a period of time, couple of years perhaps. Lynn Good : Coming into 2014, the NOL was $2.7 billion, Stephen, and I think the other thing that we would need to evaluate depending on what happens in the lame duck session is bonus depreciation extended. I think there are number of other moving pieces that could impact that assessment as well, that you may want to consider. Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley : That\u2019s a good point. Just wanted to shift over to your pipeline investment and I wanted to better understand how to think about the actual cost of gas that you\u2019ll be procuring. When you source the gas, would you be procuring gas at sort of the overall Henry Hub price, or would it need to be at a discount to Henry Hub because it\u2019s essentially coming from low-cost shale plays and you\u2019ve got to factor in transport costs? In other words, it\u2019s sort of \u2013 is the cost of the pipeline kind of in your mind, the sum cost, and then you pay for billing Henry Hub rates, or does that transport need to factor in, and therefore you would be paying a lower price for gas essentially than what we might see in the Gulf of Mexico? Lynn Good : So I think the combination of things that you\u2019re talking about are still under evaluation on specifics, Stephen, so we don\u2019t have a specific price of natural gas that we\u2019ve locked into in Marcellus. We will have a price that\u2019s implying the transport as we look at making that multiyear commitment for the utilities, but as we stand back and look at the diversity of supply, look at the pricing out of Marcellus, look at the pricing of this additional transport facility into the Carolinas, we think there is a very compelling business case for our customers to have access to low-price diverse sources of gas. And so that\u2019s exactly the business case that we believe excess for underpinning this investment for the benefit of our customers. Stephen Byrd \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Understood. Thank you very much. Lynn Good : Thank you. Steven Young : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Yes, good morning. Lynn Good : Good morning. Steven Young : Good morning, Jonathan. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Just on last \u2013 this might be \u2013 I might be reading too much into this, but last slide \u2013 last quarter on your 4% to 6% growth build-up slide, you said finalizing international strategic review and now you just you\u2019ve dropped the word finalizing. Were you close to something that you\u2019re now not close to, and the process sort of extended out a bit, or is the way do you communicating anything that? Lynn Good : I think you\u2019re reading more into it. And we should use you as part of finalizing our slide, Jonathan, to point out where we\u2019ve used language differently. No, in all seriousness, we\u2019re on the same pace we were on second quarter. And I would love to tell you that analyzing international tax is something that can be done quickly, but there are a variety of complexities and analysis. We\u2019re taking our time. This is an important part of our business that has contributed well for a long period. And so when we have an update on that, we will certainly share it but we\u2019re on target to complete our work late \u201814, early 2015. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : So you\u2019re fairly confident then that you\u2019ll know the outcome on that by the time you give your \u201815 outlook, I guess with the year-end call? Lynn Good : So that\u2019s certainly our target, Jonathan. And just to step back for a moment, when we undertook this review, we were looking at several dimensions. One dimension is, how do we optimize cash? We\u2019ve had opportunities to bring home cash in a couple of large transactions over the last several years but we would love to solve cash in a way that was more predictable and more consistent with funding in the dividend. And then secondly, we\u2019re evaluating is there a way to improve the growth profile of the business in light of what we see as near-term to mid-term headwinds, currency, pricing, etcetera. So our intent as we finish, our review would be to share our perspectives on both of those objectives, and the work we\u2019ve completed that could accomplished some or all of this objectives as we complete our work. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay, thank you. And then just somewhat similar question I\u2019m afraid, but when you first announced the Midwest generation sale, you sounded more robust about the idea that it would be accretive. Now you are saying that it depends on the timing and the ultimate use of proceeds [indiscernible] one way or another on use of proceeds that makes you less confident that this is an accretive deal? Lynn Good : Jonathan, we continue to see accretion. What we were trying to communicate is the timing is not completely firm, we were hoping actually when we started to close by the end of \u201814. We think it\u2019s probably more early \u201815. And so we\u2019re just kind of talking about that timing as we share that perspective. Steven Young : But ultimately we do see this as an accretive transaction certainly. Jonathan Arnold \u2013 Deutsche Bank : All right, great. Well, thank you very much. Lynn Good : Thanks so much. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Hi guys. Just curious, did anything change in terms of your thought process regarding rate case timelines, if any, in Carolinas. The only reason why I asked is the solar CapEx, the development of the Lee facility, just curious about how you get those in rates? Steven Young : We have no direct plans for rate case activity in the Carolinas right now. We\u2019re looking at our cost structure as we move forward. Typically when you try to play on rate case as I think about data points on rate cases, you look at when a base load plant moves into service, because your cost structure changes at that time. Lee has been scheduled for late \u201817 or during 2018 for commercial operation for the Carolinas. So that might be a point that you\u2019d look at there. Shortly following that or plant additions for DE progress as well. So that\u2019s kind of your starting point. But we\u2019re looking at our cost structure between now and then, in light of other factors. And that could compel us to move earlier or it could push us back later if other events occur. Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs : And can you give us \u2013 change in topics a little bit, when thinking about the Indiana smart grid rollout, what the annual \u2013 kind of the average annual revenue increase tied to that would be? Steven Young : So it\u2019s about less than 1% to around 1%, lower for industrial. The industrial class will not participate in all of investment. And we\u2019re targeting somewhere around $250 million of spending a year around over the seven-year period. Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Got it. Thank you, Lynn. Thanks Steve. Much appreciate it. Lynn Good : Thanks so much. Operator : We will go next to Hugh Wynne from Sanford Bernstein. Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Thank you. I have a couple of questions. My question goes to Slide 14, where you outlined your sort of 4% to 6% EPS growth trajectory and the drivers that will get you there. 4% growth over \u201815 and \u201816 in earnings is kind of an 8% increase against a 1% increase in retail load over that period, 6% growth over \u201815, \u201816 would be a 12% increase in earnings against maybe slightly more than 1% growth in retail load. I was just wondering, if you could help me understand, how you\u2019re going to close that gap in a way that\u2019s tolerable to rate payers. I understand that 4% range we\u2019re hoping to do with wholesale growth and cost control and the 7% range we\u2019re hoping to do it with accretive acquisitions, but I wonder if you just might give more color on how you close that gap? And secondly, what the long-term implications for EPS growth of 5% load growth are beyond 2016? Steven Young : Yes so \u2013 and let me discuss the growth trends broadly here. As Lynn mentioned, we\u2019ve put together some investments in the pipeline the NCEMPA acquisition. Those provide a strong earnings growth to Senate Bill 560 during the three to five year period we will start to produce some earnings as well. So we feel confident about the earnings growth rate on a longer term basis. When you look year-to-year, some of the drivers to think about, you\u2019ve got weather normalized customer growth and that\u2019s modestly forecasted at 1%. We also have wholesale sales growth and contracts that we\u2019re stepping into, that have produced earnings for us as well. Some of our investments, although not put into rates, do approve AFUDC between rate cases, and that can provide some earnings enhancement as well. Our commercial renewables business has provided a solid 1% earnings growth on a total company basis as well, and we think that business will continue to grow for us. So those are some of the metrics that we look at when we think about our longer term earnings growth rate trajectory. The ability to control O&M between rate cases is critical to utilities as well, and we certainly demonstrated that. Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Okay. Let me just ask a more specific question about the international business. You mentioned that you have this [indiscernible] in Brazil. What are the earnings implications of that beyond the quarter? Are you expecting that a year of depressed earnings, or will it take even longer to reestablish a reservoir from Brazil? Steven Young : I think when you\u2019re thinking about Brazil hydrology, one of the \u2013 probably the key factor to think about is the upcoming rainy season, which typically runs November/December through March/April. And I think the results of that rainy season will be critical to decisions made in 2015. I wouldn\u2019t try to guess at what that rainy season would look like, but I don\u2019t think that you\u2019d see any rationing occur unless there was a third consecutive core rainy season, and it\u2019s the force rationing that really has an impact on earnings. Hugh Wynne \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Great. Thanks a lot. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll go next to Ali Agha from SunTrust. Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Thank you. Good morning. Lynn Good : Good morning. Steven Young : Good morning. Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Steve, I wanted to be clear on the growth rate targets you had talked about, the 4% to 6%. So as you pointed out, some of your growth initiatives like the pipelines and the additional buyback of the assets from the municipalities etcetera, those are going to start really contributing to you more in the timeframe beyond \u201816. So if I am hearing you right, should we assume that, that contribution keeps you on the 4% to 6% growth rate beyond \u201816, or should we think of those actually taking you above the range? How should we think about these growth initiatives relative to the 4% to 6%? Steven Young : Yes, we will be rolling out beyond \u201816 in February, as we\u2019ve traditionally done. And that\u2019s the point which we\u2019ll be discussing the longer term projections of earnings, but right now we feel comfortable through \u201816 with the 4% to 6% earnings growth rate. Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay. But in a high-level sense, is it fair to say that this keeps you on-track, that kind of run rate? Lynn Good : Ali, I\u2019ll jump in. 4% to 6% is our long-term growth aspiration. We spend a lot of time in 2014 laying the foundation and groundwork for that, by putting projects in place that will give us an opportunity to deploy the capital necessary to achieve that growth rate. And so we are on track to do that. We think we\u2019ve demonstrated that with tangible projects that will deliver earnings that are consistent with what we\u2019re trying to accomplish, consistent with a strong dividend paying company. So we\u2019ll, as Steve said, update more specifics in February, but we believe that we are putting the pieces in place to deliver a strong growth rate. Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay. And then Lynn, can you remind us, the grand jury investigation around the coal ash spill. What\u2019s the status of that? Is that still ongoing, or what\u2019s happening there? Lynn Good : So the litigation continues Ali, and I can\u2019t discuss any specifics on those matters, but I will say is we\u2019re cooperating fully defending the company. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings at this point, but of course, we\u2019d provide updates when they are milestones met. Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay. And my last question, as you talked about using the proceeds from the Midwest sales, one of the potentials for that is share buybacks, but if I put that in the context of these big mega projects, the pipeline and the acquisitions coming up, and put them in the equation, Steve you said, no equity issuance through \u201816. Should we think of this as no equity issuance even beyond \u201816 when some of this big capital spend is going to be used on that \u201817, \u201818 period? Steven Young : Well, again right now I can\u2019t project beyond \u201816. We\u2019ll be finalizing our plans for beyond \u201816 and discuss that in February. But we\u2019ll be looking at our various spend for coal ash, other investments such as the pipeline in NCEMPA as we make those decisions, and we\u2019ll be firming up beyond \u201816 in February for you. Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay, but conceptually you\u2019re okay with buying back stock now if you think that makes sense, but then issuing equity in a year or two later if it\u2019s required, I mean, conceptually that\u2019s not an issue? Lynn Good : No, Ali, I would say that as we look at the options for the Midwest generation, we\u2019ll be considering the timing of all these matters including investments. And our objective is to optimize proceeds and investments in the way that creates the greatest value for shareholders. So I would say all options are on the table at this point and we\u2019ll share more specifics as we move forward. Ali Agha \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Fair enough. Thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Andy Levi from Avon Capital Advisors. Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors : Hi guys, good morning. Just a very, very quick question. Just on the international, I guess with \u2013 again oil is up actually today, but with oil down so much, I just remember from your initial guidance that you gave back in February. You had a sensitivity on Brent crude, I think it was $10 movement, it\u2019s like $0.02, and never really paid a lot of attention to that. So as you get into next year, obviously we don\u2019t know where Brent crude is going to be, but I guess it\u2019s down about $30, $35 from the beginning of the year. How should we think about that for National Methanol? Steven Young : Well, the sensitivity that we gave, Andy, is correct. About a $10 movement is $0.02 and that\u2019s a $10 average movement on an annual basis, to make sure that\u2019s clear. So that\u2019s the sensitivity, and that relates to our National Methanol subsidiary, which is a portion roughly 25% of our international business. So we will bake that into our forecast and keep an eye on where oil prices are moving as we make our projections in February. Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors : And does slightly policy \u2013 that has nothing to do with it at all as far as how they allocate oil to Asia or to the U.S. and they are pricing there. That doesn\u2019t\u2026 Lynn Good : No. And Andy this correlation that we\u2019re sharing with you is a rough correlation. We\u2019re not actually in the oil business. Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors : Right. Lynn Good : Okay. So the correlation has generally worked over time. We make more money when oil prices are high and less when oil prices are low, but it\u2019s not a perfect correlation. Andy Levi \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors : Okay. Thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Greg Gordon, Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon \u2013 Evercore ISI : Thanks. I have a follow-up question on the pipeline. Just maybe you can clarify a bit. Traditionally the shippers bear the costs of moving gas to where it\u2019s been consumed. And I guess the question is, whether or not because the cost of transportation on new pipes like this, especially given the negative basis that the Marcellus producers are already facing versus Henry Hub is so high might be prohibited for them to make it economic. Is it likely that the transportation costs will be borne to some degree by the consumers? Lynn Good : So we are entering into long-term transport contracts on the part of our utilities. That was what we put in front of the commission this, Greg, this quarter, so that we could enter into those multiyear transport contracts. And that\u2019s part of the transaction. So the utility customers will bear the transport. Steven Young : That\u2019s right. And these costs are typically passed through the fuel cost mechanisms. Greg Gordon \u2013 Evercore ISI : No, I completely understand it\u2019s a non-traditional framework relative to what E&P analysts generally think about, in your pipeline as well as some others have gotten push back from E&P investors that, well, it just seems like a very expensive transportation cost. And I pointed out to them that these are consumer-sponsored pipes and I just wanted to get some clarification on that. Steven Young : That\u2019s correct. Lynn Good : That\u2019s a demand concept [ph] versus supply. So I think that key distinction, Greg, is we look at the need for natural gas in the Carolinas and our dependency on a single pipeline, we think this diversification makes sense for our customers. Greg Gordon \u2013 Evercore ISI : I completely agree. I just wanted to understand the economics. Thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks. Lynn Good : So thank you everyone, and thanks for your interest in Duke. We look forward to seeing many of you next week in Dallas at EEI. So thanks again. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Levi - Avon Capital Advisors LLC. Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Duke Energy\u2019s Fourth Quarterly Earnings Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Bill Currens. Please go ahead. William E. Currens: Thank you, Ruth. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy\u2019s fourth quarter and full-year 2014 earnings review and business update. Leading our call is Lynn Good, President and CEO, along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the Safe Harbor statement which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our website at duke-energy.com and in today\u2019s materials. Please note that the appendix to today\u2019s presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures to help you analyze the company\u2019s performance and our financial forecast. As listed on Slide 3, Lynn will begin with a review of our key 2014 activities as well as an update on our strategic initiatives within the commercial businesses. Then Steve will review our 2014 financial results to present our 2015 financial plan and discuss our longer term adjusted earnings growth expectations. Before I turn it over to Lynn, let me a take brief moment to give you a staffing update on the Duke IR team. It is with mixed emotions that I announced this is Beau Pratt\u2019s last earnings call. After three new responsibilities within our financial organization this is a great move for Beau and for Duke Energy, but I will surely miss Beau\u2019s knowledge, tireless passion for excellence, as well as his endless smile. Beau, thank you for all you have done in helping us advance our mission to continually provide a high level of service to the investment community. With that, I will turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn J. Good: Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. In 2014, we built upon the momentum we created in 2013 celebrating key milestones and addressing challenges. We continued building our financial track record, achieving our adjusted earnings guidance range and increasing our important dividend payment to shareholders. We announced several growth initiatives that will position the company for the future and completed our strategic review of the international business. In August, we entered into a sale agreement with Dynegy for our commercial Midwest generation portfolio. We also advanced our coal ash management practices and as I will discuss in a moment we are close to an agreement with the government to resolve the ongoing grand jury investigation into our coal ash basin management. Today, we initiated our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.55 to $4.75, and also extended our long-term adjusted earnings per share growth objective of 4% to 6% through 2017. This guidance reflects strong growth in our regulated utilities offset by near-term headwinds from foreign exchange rates and oil prices in our international business. Steve will provide further details about our financial plan in a few minutes. Let me review a few operational highlights outlined on Slide 4, including our progress on ash basin closure strategies and Edwardsport. Our fleet and grid performed well during 2014, especially during the demands of the polar vortex last winter. Our regulated nuclear fleets set a new net generation record and achieved an annual capacity factor of 93%, the 16 consecutive year above 90%. We continue to deliver significant benefits from the 2012 merger and we are on track to achieve the $687 million of savings for our Carolinas customers over the first five years of the merger. In fact, 2.5 years into the merger we have generated over 60% of the guaranteed fuel and joint dispatch savings. We also learned from the challenges of the Dan River coal ash spill, we use this event as the catalyst to strengthen our ash management practices and to accelerate our base enclosure strategies positioning us well for compliance with both the North Carolina and Federal CCR requirements. We are currently in settlement discussions with the U.S. government related to the ongoing federal grand jury investigation of the February 2014 Dan River coal ash spill and ash basin operations at other North Carolina coal plants. We expect a proposed agreement could be reached and filed in the next several days for consideration by the court. If approved, any proposed agreement would resolve the ongoing grand jury investigation of the company\u2019s coal ash basin management. Based upon our assessment of probable financial exposure related to any agreement we\u2019ve recognized a charge of approximately $100 million or $0.14 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. This charge has been recognized as a special items and therefore excluded from our adjusted earnings per share. As the investigation and our discussions are ongoing I will not be able to comment further on this matter. We will keep you updated as we have further information to share. In last year session North Carolina enacted legislation which requires the company close all ash basins in the state beginning with four high priority sites Dan River, Asheville, Riverbend and Sutton. We have also submitted plans with South Carolina regulators to excavate ash from basins at our retired W.S. Lee Steam Station. Our five-year financial plans for 2019, includes $1.3 billion of estimated costs to excavate and close these five sites. As our planning progresses our capital plans will be updated. We expect to provide cost estimates to close the remaining basins one site specific closures plans and timeframes are approved by the coal ash commission by early 2016. Under the EPAs new federal coal combustion residuals rule science continues to support non-hazardous designation of coal ash as a waste. Due to our actions over the past year we have already performed a lot of the initial work and assessments needed to begin establishing closure plans under the new federal rules. As the federal rule is currently written there are some inconstancies with the requirements under the new law in North Carolina. Primarily with ash basin closure timeframes. Ultimately, we will adjust our exciting ash management plans as necessary to comply with all state and federal regulations. As one of the cleanest generating stations in the world, our Edwardsport plan in Indiana is an example of how we're reducing emissions across our system. Edwardsport continued on this path of improved operations during 2014 achieving gas supplier availability factors of between 70% and 75% in the second and third quarters. An extended plant outage in the fourth quarter impacted results. The impact or the plant which began commercial operation in June of 2013 also achieved substantial completion under the contract with General Electric in December. On a regulatory front, the Indiana Commission held hearings on the IGCC 12 & 13 & 13 Semi-Annual Riders earlier this month. Interveners have challenged the in service determination and the plants early months performance. Orders are expected mid-year for these proceedings. Edwardsport is well positioned to be a valuable resource to our Indiana customers for decades to come. I\u2019ll also highlight the performance of our commercial renewable portfolio in 2014; this business exceeded its financial target of $50 million in net income for the year and invested over $500 million in new wind and solar projects. Since its inception in 2007, we have invested over $4 billion in this business and will have over 2000 megawatts of wind and solar generation in service by the end of this year. With our acquisition of a majority interest in REC Solar earlier this month, our commercial renewable business is expanding beyond its past robust on utility scale renewable projects to a broader array of products and services. This business will focus on development of distributed solar generation and energy solutions for the commercial sector. REC Solar has more than 140 megawatts of solar generation already on customer\u2019s rooftop or under construction and we expect growth in this business as we rollout solutions to commercial customers nationwide. 2014 was also an active and successful year in advancing our growth strategy. During the year, we announced new growth initiatives representing a total investment of approximately $8 billion. These initiatives including new generation and new gas and electric infrastructure are summarized on Slide 5. Since our last call in November, a number of these initiatives achieved important mile stones. First, in Indiana our plan to invest $1.9 billion in T&D Infrastructure over seven years was filed under state legislation. Hearings were held last month and a decision is expected in mid -2015. Next our new generation investment in the Carolinas. In December, we\u2019ve received FERC approval to purchase the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency\u2019s minority ownership in some of our existing nuclear and coal generation for $1.2 billion. We have also filed for approval from the nuclear regulatory commission to transfer the nuclear licenses. The parties will work diligently to close the transaction as quickly as possible with the target to close in late 2015 or early 2016. We also continue to advance our regulated renewable strategy. In North Carolina, we have seen strong growth in Solar supported by compliance with state renewable portfolio standards and state tax incentives. In fact, North Carolina currently ranks fourth in the nation measured by total installed solar capacity. By the end of this year we expect to own over a 100 megawatts of solar generation in addition to a significant amount of PPAs where we purchase the output from other solar generating units in the state. This growth will help us continue to comply with the states growing solar requirements. In South Carolina we are laying the groundwork to develop solar generation for our customers that want that option. Just last week we proposed several programs that will expand renewable options for South Carolina customers under recent legislations. The programs are expected to add up to a 110 megawatts of solar energy by 2021, including more than 50 megawatts of utility scale solar. Next, I will provide an update on our new generation investments in Florida. Last month, we filed a petition with the Florida commission to approve our $166 million acquisition of Calpine\u2019s 599 megawatt Osprey combined cycle plant. This part of the filing we are also seeking approval for construction of the Suwannee peakers in the event that the acquisition of Osprey is not approved timely. Finally, an update on infrastructure projects in our commercial business. On the gas infrastructure front there is good progress on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline joint venture the Dominion, Piedmont and AGL Resources. The utilities commissions in both North and South Carolina have approved our regulated subsidiaries entering into 20-year gas transportation agreements with the pipeline. The project also requires FERC approval which the joint venture will seek to secure by mid-2016. These important growth initiatives support our ability to continue providing our customers affordable, reliable energy from an increasingly diverse generation portfolio. These investments also provide a solid foundation for our long-term adjusted earnings growth rate of 4% to 6% through 2017. As you will recall last February we initiated a strategic review of our international operations which today comprises about 10% of our overall business mix. We conducted a comprehensive review process that examined various options including exiting the business, growing the business on our own and achieving scale and efficiencies through various partnerships and joint venture structures. As the result of our review at this time we believe it is in our shareholders best interest for us to own, operate and create value with the business. We are taking steps to access $2.7 billion of offshore cash associated with the historic earnings of the international business. We will also continue to optimize the value and efficiency of this business. This valuable international cash help support the robust growth investment portfolio in our domestic businesses as well as the dividend. We will be disciplined with incremental international investments to meet our investment criteria and provide long-term value and growth. Before turning the call over to Steve, let me update you on the sale of our non-regulated Midwest Generation business is outlined on Slide 7. In August, we entered into an agreement to sell this business to Dynegy for $2.8 billion in cash. We had expected to close the transaction by the end of the first quarter of 2015. However, in January FERC requested additional information, in particular further analysis of market power concentration. Parties to the transaction responded to FERC on February 6 and FERC has established a shortened common period through February 23 on the updated application. Separately Dynegy entered into a settlement with the Independent Market Monitor, such that the IMM will not oppose the updated application. FERC approval is the final regulatory approval required to close. We expect to close the transaction by the end of the second quarter. We expect to deploy the $2.8 billion of cash proceeds to recapitalize our business in a balanced manner. A combination of an accelerated stock repurchase and debt reduction through the avoidance of holding company debt issuances. We will maintain flexibility with this plan, based on the circumstances of the time of closing. We are committed to maximizing shareholder value and this transaction with Dynegy is expected to be accretive to our adjusted EPS in the first 12 months after closing. And thinking back on 2014 and looking forward to the year ahead of us I am proud of the team at Duke. We are advancing our strategic growth initiatives, maintaining our sharp focus on financial discipline and pursing excellence in operations and customer service. We are focused on growing and adapting as we position the company for a changing future, and to continue meeting our 24/7 obligations to our customers, communities and investors. I look forward to reporting our progress during 2015. Now, I will turn the call over to Steve to provide financial updates. Steven K. Young: Thanks, Lynn. Today, I\u2019ll review our full-year 2014 results to discuss the economic conditions within our service territories, including customer volume trends. I will conclude with our financial plan for 2015 and our longer-term adjusted earnings growth expectations. Let\u2019s start with 2014 results as outlined on Slide 8. My comments were focused on the year-to-date results versus our original plan for the year. For more detailed information on variances versus last year. Please refer to the supporting materials of the company\u2019s today\u2019s press release. We achieved 2014 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.55 within our revised guidance range of $4.50 to $4.65. On a reported basis 2014 earnings per share were $2.66 compared to $3.76 last year. The difference between reported and adjusted earnings per share for 2014 is primarily driven by three items. Approximately $930 million of pretax impairments taken on the Midwest Generation Fleet of $373 million tax charge recognized this quarter associated with our plans to return cash from international and an approximate $100 million charge related to potential financial exposure to resolve the ongoing federal grand jury investigation. Overall, I am pleased with our ability to achieve our revised guidance range for 2014, despite facing some challenges throughout the year. Our regulated businesses exceeded their 2014 plan by about $40 million due to favorable weather partially offset by emerging cost, the winter storm respiration in coal ash related activities. Absent these cost O&M and Regulated Utilities would have been slightly lower than 2013. The Commercial Power segment fell slightly short of plan for the year. Largely due to higher purchased power cost to our competitive retail business during the first quarter polar vortex and outages at the Midwest Generation Fleet. This decline was partially offset by the renewables business which delivered around $60 million of net income above our expectations for the year. Internationals results were in line with our expectations. Higher earnings in Chile resulting from a one-time tax benefit were substantially offset by unfavorable hydrology in Brazil. Before moving on I\u2019ll touch on our strategic decision at international. As Lynn mentioned our international strategic review resulted in a plan to allow us to efficiently use our offshore cash. Historically, our intent has been to permanently reinvest the undistributed earnings from our foreign operations in offshore investment opportunities. As a result of this intent we have now previously recognized U.S. income taxes on these amounts we only recognized foreign taxes. In the fourth quarter, we declared a taxable dividend of $2.7 billion in the form of notes payable related to historical undistributed earnings. This gives us the ability to use this cash in the U.S. As a result we recognized a $373 million U.S. income tax charge this quarter; we expect to remit between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion in 2015. With the remaining amount remitted by 2022. We currently have $1.7 billion of offshore cash. Considering both the impact of this transaction and the one year extension of bonus depreciation recently enacted by Congress, we do not expect to be a significant cash tax payer until the 2018 timeframe. Respectively cash generated from the international operations will mostly be used to payoff the notes of its parent Duke Energy, the remainder will be reinvested in the international business. As a result these future uses of cash, we will not accrue any U.S. income taxes on future earnings. Duke Energy\u2019s overall tax position presented us with the unique opportunity to implement this structure and use foreign tax credits making it more tax efficient than it otherwise would have been. Moving on to Slide 9, I\u2019ll now discuss our retail customer volume trends. For the full-year, overall weather normalized retail load growth was 0.6% inline with our expectations for 2014. Excluding the impact of two large industrial customers that closed during the year in Eastern North Carolina. Our weather-normal retail load growth would have been 0.8%. Industrial and commercial had been stable over the past several years as these classes have lead the economic recovery. Both classes grew at 1% in 2014, led by the automotive, metals, chemicals, healthcare and education sub sectors. Our economic development team played a key role in improving 85 new industrial and commercial projects to our service territories during the year. These projects represent $3.5 billion in capital investments and over 11,000 new jobs in our six state service area. Notable companies included GE, Wal-Mart and Amazon. Turning to the residential sector, for the last several years we have seen consistent acceleration in the growth of the number of customers in our service territories, this growth is now around 1% with particular strength in the Carolinas and Florida. However, offsetting this growth has been declining usage per customer trends. We believe this decline is due to several factors, including an increase in the number of apartments and condominiums as appose to single family homes. However, looking forward there are positive signs in the residential sector. Full-time employment in our states continues to improve. In 2014, 20% of the new jobs added in the U.S. were in states served by Duke Energy. Additionally, the fourth quarter saw gains in median household income. As well as growth and housing starts in our service areas. Based on this data in 2015 we are anticipating retail customer load growth between 0.5% and 1.0%. If the economy continues to recover and consumers gain more confidence, we believe longer-term load growth trends should improve to about 1% annually. Moving on to Slide 10 and our adjusted earnings guidance range for 2015, which is between $4.55 and $4.75 per share. I will briefly touch on our primary assumptions for 2015. Based upon achieving the midpoint of our guidance range for the year. Let\u2019s start with the key drivers of regulated utilities, which is expected to deliver around $0.07 of additional earnings per share in 2015 over 2014. Significant drivers include retail load growth of between 0.5% and 1.0%. Additional wholesale earnings, as a result of new contracts, earnings through Riders or AFUDC on our regulated investments. And finally, our continued focus on maintaining an efficient cost structure. Our commercial power segment is expected to contribute increased earnings per share of approximately $0.11 in 2015. First, our renewables business continues to grow with around 375 megawatts of new wind and solar generation set to come online in 2015. We expect renewables to contribute around $100 million in net income during 2015 and our adjusted earnings will continue to include the Midwest Generation Fleet until the Dynegy sale closes, which we assume will be by the end of the second quarter. The user proceeds from the sale of Midwest Generation Fleet is expected to provide a $0.05 earnings uplift in 2015. These growth drivers are being partially offset by weakness at international as we expect segment earnings per share to decrease by approximately $0.12 during the year. The decline is largely due to three factors, one declining earnings, contributions from our interest in national methanol, with sales products that are correlated to crude oil prices. Our plan assumes a $65 per barrel Brent crude oil price for the year. Two the impacts of foreign exchange rates as we expect the U.S. dollar to continue strengthening against the Brazilian Real and three the prior year Chilean tax benefit, which will not recur. Our 2015 assumptions for international assume normal hydrology in Brazil. Even though the rainy season has started slow, it\u2019s too early to speculate on the likelihood of rationing this year. If hydrology is unfavorable, or worse rationing is implemented in Brazil, we will have an unfavorable impact on our financial results for the year. The midpoint of our 2015 guidance range fall slightly below the bottom of our 4% to 6% long-term adjusted diluted EPS objective, primarily due to the weakness I just discussed it internationally in particular National Methanol and foreign exchange rates are driving approximately $0.12 year-over-year decline. Additionally, the recent decision to extend bonus depreciation through 2014, causes our net operating loss position for tax purchases to extend into 2015. This NOL precludes us from taking the full manufacturers deduction in 2015 resulting in an unfavorable recent impact to our earnings projection for 2015. We also have a wider guidance range than normal, $0.20 versus $0.15. This range covers additional uncertainty due to the volatility in crude oil prices, foreign exchange rates and the timing of closing the Midwest generation sale for Dynegy. As I will discuss in a moment, the post 2015 growth profile is very promising and we continue to project the longer-term adjusted diluted EPS growth objective of 4% to 6% through 2017. Slide 11, shows our high level 2015 cash flows and financing plan. In addition to cash flows from our normal operations, our decision to repatriate cash from international and the anticipated sale of our Midwest Generation business is expected to provide significant cash flows this year. We expect to quickly put this cash to work in support of our financial objectives to a balanced recapitalization. Our planning assumption is a split of 50% debt retirements of the holding company and 50% for the accelerated share repurchases. Our plans could change based upon circumstances at closing. The financing plans supports our dividend, strong balance sheet and credit quality. We do not perceive the need for equity issuances through 2017. Let\u2019s shift now to Slide 12 and our longer-term adjusted earnings per share growth objective of 4% to 6%, which we are extending through 2017. This long-term growth objective is anchored to the Midpoint of our 2013 adjusted earnings guidance range of $4.32 per share. We experienced 5% growth from this space in 2014, which was driven impart by implementation of revised customer rates in the Carolinas and Midwest. Let me explain the primary drivers of our 4% to 6% growth over the next three years. I will start with regulated utilities. We do not anticipate any base rate cases through 2017. Our growth was expected to be supported by retail and wholesale load growth and significant investments. First, retail load growth provides additional earnings out of the existing investment base in particular in between rate cases. As a rule of thumb 0.5% to 1% of annual load growth provides roughly 1% to 2% earnings growth. Second, our regulated wholesale business will grow significantly in 2015. As we enter new contracts in our existing contracts growth. We expect $0.10 of growth in 2015 on top of the $0.06 we gained in 2014. Third, we expect to invest between $4 billion and $5 billion annually in growth projects in the regulated business. Although, we do not project the need for rate cases many of these investments will be recovered through riders such as transmission and distribution expenditures in Indiana and Ohio. As well as the Crystal River 3 Rider in Florida and energy efficiency riders in the Carolinas. We\u2019ll approved AFUDC during construction period for large investments that do not get incorporated into rates or riders before 2018 such as the lead project in the Carolinas, Citrus County project in Florida, Fukushima related nuclear investments and environmental projects. Additionally, the acquisition of assets from NCEMPA and the related wholesale power contract will add earnings starting in 2016. In our commercial renewables business we expect to continue growing our portfolio wind and solar generation deploying around $1 billion to $2 billion over the next three years. Additionally, investments in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline will add about $1 billion of capital through 2017. The balance recapitalization plan using Midwest Generation sale proceeds is also expected to be accretive to a long-term adjusted earnings per share growth. Finally, our international business. We expect to strengthen the U.S. dollar to be a headwind through 2017. Our forecast assumes Brazilian reservoir levels will return to normal by 2017. It is also important to remember that we are projecting annual demand growth in Brazil at slightly above 2% and National Methanol we do not expect the current level of depressed oil prices will persist into 2017. Our ownership percentage of NMC is expected to decline from 25% to 17.5% in mid-2016. The core National Methanol business remains strong as that is one of the most efficient methanol production facilities in the world. Next, let me briefly highlight the risk to our growth plan both near and long-term as I see them. We will continually monitor variability in retail load growth trends, in particular the residential calls, solid load growth is important to meeting our earnings targets. Additionally, we will keep our eye on some of the variables at international such as hydrology in Brazil, foreign exchange rates and crude oil prices. Finally, it would be important that we continue to manage our cost and realize efficiencies in the business. Even though our 4% to 6% earnings per share growth objective is to 2017, I want to give you a feel for some of the growth drivers we expect as we look into 2018 and 2019. First, the new generation projects in Florida and the Carolinas are expected to be completed and move into rates either through [Riders] or base rate adjustments. Additionally, we expect to continue investing around $4 billion in 2018 and 2019 in the growth projects for new generation, T&D Infrastructure and environment compliance. The Atlantic Coast pipeline is expected online in late 2018 and discretionary growth projects in our commercial renewable business will provide additional support to our growth. Due to our size and scope, we will have different growth drivers at different times; taken together these drivers provide us solid foundation with continued growth overtime. Slide 13 outlines our financial objectives for 2015 and beyond, we have an established track record of achieving those objectives and have a strong plan in place to continue delivering attractive returns for our investors. We have met or exceed our earnings guidance range for five consecutive years; we have delivered on our overall long-term for the 66% adjusted diluted earnings per share growth objective since 2009. Today, we announced our 2015 adjusted earnings guidance range of $4.55 to $4.75 per share and we extended our long-term adjusted earnings growth objective of 4% to 6% in 2017. We will continue to focus on the dividend which is central to our investor value proposition; we have reliably paid a quarterly dividend to our shareholders for 89 years and have grown the dividend for seven consecutive years. We currently pay $2.2 billion annually in dividends to our shareholders within our targeted payout ratio of between 65% and 70%. With that, let's open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Daniel Eggers : Hey, good morning, guys. Lynn J. Good: Hi, Dan. Steven K. Young: Good morning. Daniel Eggers : Now that you've gotten through the review on the international assets and you have reiterated the 4% to 6% EPS growth target, how do we think about the balance of growth? Because I assume you guys are embedding little or no growth international, which means the domestic businesses are actually going to grow faster than 4% to 6%. Is that fair? Lynn J. Good: Dan, we continue to look for ways to invest capital. So you will find some growth capital and our expectations and international, but given the fact that it\u2019s roughly 10% of the business you can expect greater growth, the lion share of the growth coming from regulated. The only other thing I would add that is as I think about regulated earnings growth is not just the utilities I think you put the pipeline into that category as well FERC regulated growth item that will show up in commercial, but nonetheless its important to the growth picture. Daniel Eggers : And then I guess kind of from a treatment from an earnings perspective from the international because you guys took the charge in the fourth quarter, there's going to be no change in realized tax rate even as you bring international earnings back to the U.S. because I guess you guys front-end loaded the tax payment. Is that the right way to think about what you guys did? Steven K. Young: Yes, that\u2019s correct what we\u2019ve done is recognize the income tax liability associated with historic earnings. Prospectively we will not include any U.S. income taxes. And we are projecting that our effective tax for 2015 will be about 32%. Daniel Eggers : Okay, just one last question. Just on the renewable investments, you had Dominion at their analyst day who said that they were going to keep investing for another year or two and then look to monetize those renewable businesses, given the fact the lower EPS contribution to asset deployed. How does that fit to you guys' thoughts on investment in that business and the right fit for you relative to maybe some of these yieldco folks who can pay more for a similar set of assets? Lynn J. Good: Dan I think there are a couple of questions in here, one our competitive positioning and then what is the long-term strategic set of renewables. And we continue to see it as an important place for us to deploy capital. We see growth in that area, but like any element of our business from time-to-time will set back and see where it fits and how does that optimize value, but that\u2019s as far as I would go at this point, overall we see renewables becoming an increasingly part of the generation portfolio. And we\u2019ll continue deploying capital in a manner that creates the most value for our shareholder. Daniel Eggers : Great. Thank you guys. Lynn J. Good: Thank you. Steven K. Young: Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Michael Weinstein with UBS. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Hey, it\u2019s Julien. Good morning. Steven K. Young: Good morning, Julien. Lynn J. Good: Julien also known as Michael. How are you? Julien Dumoulin Smith : Thank you quite well. I wanted to perhaps follow up on Dan's question there, and kind of come back to the 4% to 6% for 2016 and 2017. Is that weighted towards 2017, or are you really think about a real pickup next year? If so, what are those drivers as you think about the domestic businesses? To what extent does capital deployment also drive some of that improvement, 2015 to 2016? Lynn J. Good: Julien, I would point to guidance for 2015 and then the long-term growth rate of 4% to 6%. And we\u2019ve given you some visibility and what you are going to see in 2016, so we hope to close the Eastern Power Agency. We will begin showing earnings from other launch from capital deployment, we have certain things that will occur on riders. So I think we\u2019ve given you the pieces, we aren\u2019t prepared to give specific guidance on 2016 today, but we feel like we\u2019ve developed the pipeline that will drive growth into the future. Julien Dumoulin Smith : But to be specific here, is 2016 kind of the improvement, or ultimately you are not ready to say 2016 versus 2017 to get to that 4% to 6%? Steven K. Young: I don\u2019t think we want to get into 2016 versus 2017 at this point, but what I would describe to you is that the growth portfolio is strong, we are projecting to be investing an average of $8 billion a year. 2014 was a relatively low capital year and that\u2019s just the nature of the business in terms of the timing of the resources you need for your regulated business when you are closing deals. We are looking at 2016 being nearly $10 billion of investment and you include the NCEMPA acquisition. And our rate base is growing, our regular rate base growing 6%. So it\u2019s hard to know exactly how that will manifest itself through rates riders AFUDC exactly, but the investment base is growing. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Great, and a small detail here. You said you expect that the Midwest transaction would close midyear. Is that a reflection on an any more bearish view on timing, or is it really kind of \u2013 or could potentially be a little earlier than that? Lynn J. Good: Julien it\u2019s a planning assumption. I think what the accelerated common period that FERC put forward in the settlement that Dynegy has reached with the market monitor, we believe closing could occur more rapidly, but for planning assumptions we put it into the second quarter and we\u2019ll update as events unfold. It\u2019s difficult to predict with certainty FERC\u2019s timeline. Julien Dumoulin Smith : . : Lynn J. Good: Thanks, so much. Steven K. Young: Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Brian Chin with Bank of America. Brian Chin : Hi, good morning. Lynn J. Good: Good morning, Brian. Steven K. Young: Good morning, Brian. Brian Chin : Just to springboard off Julien and Dan's questions, for the recovery of the EPS trajectory back to 2016 from 2015, the way I took your prepared comments there is a little bit of a drag in 2015 on FX and oil. So is some bounceback on those assumed in the 2016 guidance, or is it your view that the growth portfolio is strong enough to account for an FX oil price environment that sort of perpetuates from 2015 onwards, and you still get back to the 4% to 6% trajectory? Lynn J. Good: Yes, Brian what I would say we\u2019ll be closely watching oil prices for example I do not - we do not believe that the level we are at today will persist, in Steve\u2019s remarks we set into 2017 we also are not projecting they persist into 2016 at this level either. So we have a combination of things in our portfolio that we think will come together, but I think directing attention to the investments is important because that\u2019s going to be the most significant driver of growth over the long-term for the company. Brian Chin : Great. Thank you very much. Lynn J. Good: Thank you. Steven K. Young: Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Jonathan P. Arnold: Good morning. Steven K. Young: Good morning. Lynn J. Good: Hi, Jonathan. Jonathan P. Arnold: Quick question, just so I understand what you have done on repatriation. You described it as a tax-efficient solution, but then you seem to be booking what I guess is a worst-case scenario on tax. What happens if there is some form of a tax holiday going forward? Will you then release some of this reserve? And because you have structured it as a note, does that effectively help with this? Could you just put some light on that comment? Steven K. Young: Sure, let me give a little color to that, we booked roughly $370 million in the fourth quarter related to this. And that reflects a tax efficient structure, we don\u2019t expect before 2016 any comprehensive tax legislation, there are various proposals that are kicked about and in fact President Obama\u2019s proposal talks about 19% tax on repatriated earnings which would be less efficient then what we put in place. So I think we have maximized our ability to utilize foreign tax credits and taking advantage of our tax positioning pretty well with this structure. Jonathan P. Arnold: Okay, so there's not a potential for it to improve, or is there? That's kind of like? Steven K. Young: Well, I think that we\u2019ve recognized the right liability based on our historic earnings and it basically represents kind of a top off tax between foreign tax amounts accrued and paid and the U.S. tax rate and what is also unique here is that we will not be approving any U.S. income taxes perspectively which helps as well. Jonathan P. Arnold: Okay, and then another topic on wholesale. I think I heard you say $0.10 of wholesale may come in 2015, on top of $0.06 in 2014. Does some of that carry forward into 2016 on a full-year basis, and just what you would think about 2016 and 2017 on the wholesale line? Steven K. Young: As we move forward 2014 and 2015 were big years where we stepped into wholesale contracts, so we saw some nice growth there. That will level out a bit after 2015. We will continue to see some growth in wholesale as our existing contracts grow and we step into some smaller ones, it won\u2019t be at the level that we have seen in 2014 and 2015. Jonathan P. Arnold: Okay, great. Thank you guys. Lynn J. Good: Thanks Jonathan. Steven K. Young: Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Yes, hey guys, congrats on a good year. Lynn J. Good: Hi Mike. Steven K. Young: Okay. Michael Lapides : Just a question on Slide 23, and then kind of thinking about core growth in net income versus growth in EPS. Your regulated utility growth is about 2%, kind of as you outline on this slide. Commercial power has $90 million of kind of nonrecurring benefit in it in 2015, meaning that won't be there in 2016. Just curious when you think about drivers of the 4% to 6% longer-term, how much of that is driven by just longer-term continued reductions in the share count? Or do you view this as kind of a one-time buyback that's being done now and then there's no more kind of major capital allocations outside of dividends on the equity side of the balance sheet going forward? Lynn J. Good: You know Michael, we are certainly going to use balance recapitalization to address the accident of the Midwest generation business. We think that is an appropriate utilization of proceeds given where we are at this point. I think what you can expect on regulated utilities is that growth will be lumpy at time for lack of a more sophisticated word, because of capital deployment rate case is another thing. So as you look at 2015 it\u2019s a no rate case year, and so we would expect growth to accelerate there around reflection of the earnings from the investments we're putting in place. We also expect commercial will grow as we continue to put renewable investment to work and as the pipeline begins to show up. So I think we could talk to each of these individually, but there will be growth that shows up from deployment of investment and this is share repurchase we think it\u2019s consistent with the exit of a business. Michael Lapides : Okay, just to sanity check one thing on the pipeline; will you be booking AFUDC earnings during construction? So the earnings impact will actually happen before the pipeline goes in service? Steven K. Young: Yes, that\u2019s correct, we will Michael. Michael Lapides : Got it, thanks guys. Much appreciated. Lynn J. Good: Thanks, so much. Steven K. Young: Sure. Operator : We will go next to Chris Turnure with JP Morgan. Christopher J. Turnure: Good morning Lynn and Steve. Lynn J. Good: Good morning. Steven K. Young: Hello. Christopher J. Turnure: I just wanted to talk a little bit more about 2015 at the regulated utilities first. We've talked about it a lot so far, but just I would've expected a little bit more growth even without a rate case there, given the fact that you are getting the load growth and all of that wholesale growth even though weather normalization is going to hurt you. And then you also mentioned a couple pennies of a tax hit as well. Is there anything else within 2015 specifically that we might be missing there? Steven K. Young: I think typically when you look at 2015 for the regulated utilities you got the organic load growth that we are looking at for the retail, the wholesale those are pieces there. We should have some growth from Riders and AFUDC as investments build. But again 2014 was a low capital year so we are just starting to build the tank on some of these larger investments such as the lead combined cycle in the Citrus County. So there maybe lag in some of that build up that you see in 2015 relative to where we are going to be in 2016 and 2017 and maybe a part of it there. And then there is what we call rate lag, if you will, and that\u2019s O&M which we are trying to hold in check and have had success doing that thus far, but there is always emergent cost that have to be dealt with. And then there is additional depreciation and interest on capital projects \u2013 smaller capital projects that go into service prior to a rate case. So those are kind of the major components. And I think that one of the things you maybe also factoring in is nuclear levelization, which impacts our O&M in an unusual fashion we got a large benefit in 2013 from nuclear levelization as we started to levelize nuclear outage costs. And that has negative impacts in 2014 and 2015. After 2015 we will be through with that and it won\u2019t be a driver. Christopher J. Turnure: Okay. Then if we look at the drivers for the international segment for 2015, you do say that you are assuming normal hydrology throughout the balance of the year or the entire year overall. It doesn't look like that is much of a driver, though, in terms of EPS. We have the crude headwinds and the forex headwinds, but should we not be thinking about that helping earnings a lot this year? Steven K. Young: Well, I think you hit the major drivers which are the FX in the crude for international, when you look at hydrology in Brazil I think we are assuming normal hydrology, but I think even under normal hydrology the thermals will be dispatched first throughout the year, that would put some constrains on our hydro generation capabilities or contract pricing does grow and those contracts are profitable. But given the thermal dispatching order even under normal hydrology coming out of two years of drought that will constrict some of our ability to make sales into the spot market. So there is some offsetting things there in Brazil. I think you hit the big drivers for international with FX in oil pricing. Christopher J. Turnure: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Lynn J. Good: Thank you. Steven K. Young: Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go next to Ali Agha with SunTrust. Ali Agha : Thank you, good morning. Lynn J. Good: Good morning. Ali Agha : Steve, in your 2015 guidance you gave us your assumptions for crude \u2013 for oil price as well as the FX in Brazil. Can you remind us what the sensitivities are around that base assumption? Steven K. Young: Yes, the 10% movement on the price of oil is in the neighborhood of $0.01 to $0.02 and that\u2019s an annual basis. Lynn J. Good: $10. Steven K. Young: $10 on the price - thinking of the oil always remain on a $100 and then 10% movement on FX rates for the entire year is in the neighborhood of $0.03. Ali Agha : Okay. And then secondly for the NCEMPA acquisition, I see that you have assumed $0.05 to $0.10 of earnings. Why is there that $0.05 delta in that contribution? I would have thought it would be fairly set once you complete that acquisition. Steven K. Young: And those assumptions around financing basically, if it were finance entirely with cash, then you would be at the upper end of that range, if it were financed 50% at holdco debt and you would be at the lower end of that range. So we are just incorporating some financing sensitivities there. Ali Agha : I see. Then lastly, Lynn, coming back to the international business, once you have brought that cash back in and you've managed it well that way, going forward your exposure oil price, what about what happens to hydro and the remaining out in Brazil with FX going? There's still that variability out there. From an earnings perspective, I don't hear much about that it's going to grow like your regular business does. So strategically, would that still fit the profile that you're trying to create here with stable, visible, predictable earnings and dividend growth? Lynn J. Good: I think you raise a good question and certainly as we undertook the strategic review we were looking at both elements, we were looking at cash optimization and we are looking at growth. I think we came up with an outstanding solution around cash and I think its particularly time really when you think about the level of capital spending and projects we\u2019ve identified in the domestic business, but we do have some near-term headwinds from our growth perspective. The NMC investment was not a part of the strategic review, that\u2019s a joint venture that we are in and towards the later part of the 2020s and so we will continue to have some volatility around oil prices. And I think the business in Latin America we do have some foreign currency, we have hydrology in the short-term, but we believe that this markets represents strong markets over the long-term and we will continue to look for ways we can optimize value out of that portfolio. I think stepping back from all of that we should also recognize that this only 10% of Duke\u2019s business. Ali Agha : Right, but we are done with the review. This is not something you will come back another year or two. I mean this was pretty comprehensive and we are done for now? Lynn J. Good: We are done for now. Ali Agha : Great, thank you. Lynn J. Good: Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Lynn J. Good: Good morning, Paul. Paul Patterson : Good morning, can you hear me? How are you? Steven K. Young: Hi. Lynn J. Good: Yes, good. Paul Patterson : Just a follow-up on the oil and currency expectations post-2015. As you know, the forward curve is sloping upward to begin with. So I was just wondering when you say that you don't expect them to stay at these low levels, are you talking about the forward curve in general? In other words, do you have an expectation above the forward curve or and to get and through get best for the most part right now or is this just you are just commenting on the fact that the forward curve goes up considerably in the next few years? Lynn J. Good: Yes, so we use the fund with the forward curves, Paul to plan our business, we\u2019ll of course look at sensitivities around that, but we do not have an independent market view. Paul Patterson : Okay, great. Then with respect to the sale of the Dynegy, I think Julien was asking about this. If you guys were to sell it earlier, considerably earlier, would that have a material impact on 2015? Steven K. Young: No that would not have a material impact you include some of the earnings from the Midwest gen from that period of time, the recapitalization benefits we kick in earlier in the net of those two is immaterial. Paul Patterson : Okay, that's it. The rest of my questions have been asked. Thanks a lot. Lynn J. Good: Thanks so much. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital. Andrew S. Levi: Hi good morning. Lynn J. Good: Hi Andy. Steven K. Young: Hey Andy. Andrew S. Levi: Hi, how are you doing? Lynn J. Good: Good. Steven K. Young: Good. Andrew S. Levi: Just one clarification on the wholesale at the utilities, or really I guess at the Carolina utilities. How does that work in a rate case? Because you have your growth and then you said there was like growth in \u2013 smaller growth in 2016 and 2017. But if you file a rate case in, let's say, North Carolina, is there some type of true-up? I'm just trying to remember. Steven K. Young: There is not a true-up, let me \u2013 some of the mechanics I\u2019ll explain, when you file a rate case you will typically look at who are your firm customers retail and wholesale and you will allocate costs in that fashion and in the states we will set retail rates based upon those cost allocated to the retail customer load. So the existence of firm wholesale does impact base rate allocations. Lynn J. Good: On a perspective basis. Steven K. Young: But perceptively you do don\u2019t go back and say well let's redo the allocations in the past. Andrew S. Levi: Okay. So for like modeling purposes \u2013 I'm just throwing out numbers \u2013 let's say there was a $0.15 benefit over a two-year or three-year period in between the rate cases. You don't lose that $0.15, but I guess it gets taken out on the retail side. So if you were going to have, I don't know, a $200 million rate increase, there's some type of adjustment on the retail side to compensate for the benefit on the wholesale side. Is that kind of the way to look at it? Steven K. Young: Perceptively that\u2019s the way to look at it. Yes, you will reallocate cost based on your retail and wholesale customers again on a perspective basis. Andrew S. Levi: And is there a way for us to figure that out, or that's too complicated for us? Lynn J. Good: Andy I think offline the IR team could talk you through that but I think we are talking about something that\u2019s two or three years down the road and probably a better conversation as we get closer to the rate cases. Andrew S. Levi: Great, okay. Thank you very much. Lynn J. Good: Thanks so much. Steven K. Young: Good. End of Q&A Lynn J. Good: Okay, I want to thank all of you for joining the call today and for your interest in Duke Energy. We look forward to seeing many of you in March as we pursue and attend many of the conferences. So thanks again. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bill Currens. Please go ahead, sir. William Currens : Thank you, Derek. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy\u2019s first quarter 2015 earnings review and business update. Leading our call is Lynn Good, President and CEO, along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the Safe Harbor statement which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today\u2019s materials. Please note that the appendix to today\u2019s presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures to help you analyze the company\u2019s performance. As listed on Slide 3, Lynn will begin with an update on our principal first quarter activities. Then, Steve will review our 2015 first quarter financial results, including an update on what we\u2019re experiencing in Brazil. Finally, Steve will close with an update on economic activities within our service territories as well as a review of our recently announced $1.5 billion accelerated stock repurchase program. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. With the first quarter behind us, I\u2019m pleased to report that we are on track to meet our financial objectives for the year and are demonstrating strong operational performance for our customers. We are making progress on our near-term objectives and achieving important milestones on the strategic initiatives we announced last year, including growth investments totaling $8 billion. Our strategies reflect a focus on new generation investments, electric and gas infrastructure and contracted renewable opportunities. Now, let\u2019s focus on the quarter. This morning, we reported first quarter 2015 adjusted EPS of $1.24. We also affirmed our full-year 2015 guidance range of $4.55 to $4.75 per share. Steve will provide more details on the quarterly results in a few minutes. Let me start with reviewing a few operational highlights as outlined on Slide 4. I\u2019m pleased with how our system performed during record cold temperatures during the first quarter. On February 20, we set new all-time peak demand records in the Carolinas. Our teams demonstrated exceptional preparation and collaboration across the company in meeting this challenge. Our generation fleet performed well during the experience of record demand as our customers benefited from our diversified portfolio of generation resources. The regulated natural gas fleets at a record for the quarter delivering more than 12 million megawatt hours. The performance of our nuclear fleet continued to improve, serving as a valuable resource of baseload generation to our customers. The fleet achieved a quarterly capacity factor of almost 94%, led by the Robinson and Harris plants which set generation records for the quarter. We also recently learned that our nuclear fleet as a whole led the nation\u2019s large nuclear fleets in 2014 as measured by several key performance indicators. Our operational teams also responded to a series of major winter storms. In the Carolinas alone, three severe storms caused more than a million outages. We used the scale of our company to effectively prepare for and respond to these challenges. For example, in one major storm, we deployed more than 3500 workers and restored power to 85% of the affected customers within 24 hours. Our ability to restore service in the wake of storms was recognized in March by EEI. We were awarded the institute\u2019s Emergency Recovery Award for our restoration efforts in the winter of 2014. Our Edwardsport IGCC plant in Indiana also performed well during the first quarter. We believe the best measure of performance for Edwardsport is over a long term basis. However, it\u2019s worth highlighting that the plant achieved 79% gasifier availability, representing its highest individual quarter yet. After last winter\u2019s challenges, we made a number of enhancements to the plant, driving this year\u2019s performance. We expect orders in the Indiana Commission on several pending rider proceedings around mid-year. We\u2019ve made significant headway on other important strategic and regulatory priorities, which I will briefly cover on Slide 5. We achieved a major milestone in our proposed $1.2 billion acquisition of jointly-owned generating assets from the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency. State legislation that enables these municipalities to issue revenue bonds was finalized in March. And it also allows Duke Energy progress to recover through a rider mechanism, its retail investment and operating costs associated with the acquisition. This important legislative milestone follows last December\u2019s approval by FERC. We remain on track to close the acquisition later this year once we receive approvals from the NRC, all 32 individual municipalities and the state regulatory commission. Once closed, we expect an annualized incremental earnings per share impact of between $0.05 and $0.10. The plan to acquire these generation assets is a win-win for all parties involved. The municipalities in eastern North Carolina get rate relief which will be a boost to economic development in the entire region. And our Carolinas customers will enjoy significant fuel savings from the addition of valuable nuclear and coal generation capacity to our supply mix, helping to mitigate the impact of the purchase on retail customer rates. In March, we filed with the FERC for approval of our proposed purchase of Calpine\u2019s Osprey combined cycle gas plant in Florida. This 599 megawatt plant will help offset the impact of system retirement. If the Osprey purchase is not approved in a timely manner, we have requested state commission approval to build 320 megawatt of new combustion turbine capacity at our [Swany] site. We have requested FERC approval by July 30. In early April, the Ohio commission approved our next three-year Electric Security Plan, or ESP. the commission approved our request for two important rider mechanisms, a distribution capital investment rider and a storm cost rider. Parties including Duke Energy Ohio have until May 4 to file for a re-hearing. We are evaluating this option for certain provisions in the order and will provide updates as needed. Earlier this week, the Florida legislature passed new utilities regulations, including a provision allowing securitization of our remaining Crystal River 3 costs. This law is still subject to being signed by the Governor. As you will recall, our 2013 settlement in Florida included a provision allowing for us to begin recovering up to $1.46 billion of Crystal River 3 assets and customer rates by beginning of 2017. The securitization would allow us to provide a significant rate benefit to our customers, while also providing full cash recovery of these investments. If signed by the Governor, we anticipate seeking Florida commission approval later this year to issue bonds in early 2016. Also in early April, we successfully closed the transaction to sell our Midwest Commercial Generation business to Dynegy for $2.8 billion in cash. With the sale complete, we\u2019ve been able to sharpen our focus on the regulated business and quickly redeploy the proceeds to ensure an accretive transaction within the first 12 months. In a moment, Steve will discuss the use of proceeds. Our International business has been experiencing challenges due to the continued drought conditions and a softening economy in Brazil as well as weaker foreign currency exchange rates and lower MTBE prices at National Methanol. Steve will provide more detail on what we are experiencing during his prepared remarks. Next, I will provide an update on our coal ash management activity. We have been taking action to improve our management of ash across each of our jurisdictions in a manner that protects the environment and our communities. As you may recall, in February, we reached a proposed plea agreement with the US government. If approved, the agreement would close the federal investigation related to the Dan River coal ash spill and basin operations in North Carolina. In April, the Judge granted a four-week continuance of the hearing to May 14 to allow the court more time to prepare. As a consequence of this [indiscernible] plea, we\u2019re working through an agreement to avoid debarment with the EPA. We have been working for some time on this proposed agreement and our target is to have it in place by the hearing on May 14. If an agreement is not in place by this date, for some period of time, we would need to obtain prior approval before entering into new or modified contracts federal government agencies. This is not expected to result in any material financial or operational impacts. We have been actively working on plans to close all of our ash basins in North Carolina under the provisions of the Coal Ash Management Act. We are required to obtain permits before beginning execution of ash at the initial four high priority sites. These permits which we applied for last year are being reviewed by DENR. We expect to be able to begin moving ash later this year. We also continue to develop plans for our remaining 10 sites in North Carolina and finally we expect to begin moving ash from our W.S. Lee plant in South Carolina later this month. Environmental matters including EPA regulations are certainly a focus of ours over the coming years. The EPA\u2019s proposed Clean Power Plan creates aggressive state specific targets to reduce CO2 emissions. The plan is scheduled to be finalized this summer and includes some of the most far-reaching and complex regulations the industry has ever faced. We continue to engage with the EPA and states in support policies that reduce carbon emissions over time without jeopardizing reliability and affordability. This is not a one side solution to this issue, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s important that our states maintain flexibility as they develop plans to comply with the final targets. I will also mention that the EPA published its final coal combustion residuals rule in the Federal register on April 17. This new rule regulates the disposal of coal ash and is applicable to all new and existing landfills, structural fills and new and existing ash basins at active sites. We have already begun a site by site evaluation to determine our plans for compliance with these Federal provisions across each of our jurisdictions beginning later this year. Additionally, in North Carolina, we must also comply with the state\u2019s Coal Ash Management Act, which requires a closure of all basins in this state over the next 15 years. Since the federal and state rules contain some conflicting provisions, such as different compliance, timelines and groundwater monitoring requirements, our actions will be based upon the most restrictive provisions. We have already recognized the $3.5 billion in asset retirement obligations for our North Carolina sites to comply with the state legislation. The new federal rules would result in actions in our other jurisdictions, in particular Indiana, where most of the remaining ash is located. We will recognize incremental asset retirement obligations for the federal rules in the second quarter. However, similar to the North Carolina rules, any closure costs are expected to be incurred over a long-term time horizon. In closing, we are on track to meet our objectives for the year with a strong focus on operational excellence and financial discipline. We are moving forward responsibly in our ash management plans. We are successfully executing on the growth projects and strategic initiatives announced last year, positioning Duke Energy for long-term success. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve. Steven Young : Thanks, Lynn. Today, I\u2019ll review our first quarter financial results and discuss the economic conditions within our service territories, including retail customer volume trends. I will also provide an update on Brazil\u2019s challenging economy and ongoing drought conditions. Finally, I will briefly review the accelerated stock repurchase plan we launched in April with the Midwest Generation sale proceeds. Let\u2019s start with the quarterly results. I will cover just the highlights on Slide 6. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today\u2019s press release. We achieved first quarter adjusted diluted earnings of $1.24 per share compared to $1.17 in the first quarter of 2014. Strong results from our Regulated Utilities and commercial Midwest Generation business helped offset weakness at International. On a reported basis, 2015 first quarter earnings per share were $1.22 compared to a net loss of $0.14 last year. The loss in last year\u2019s reported results included the pre-tax impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion or $1.23 per share related to the Midwest Generation business. Let me briefly review the key quarterly earnings drivers at each of our business segments. On an adjusted basis, Regulated Utilities delivered higher results of $0.05 per share, primarily due to increased wholesale margins and higher retail rates, including energy efficiency cost recovering mechanisms. Similar to last year, we experienced cold weather during the quarter. So it was not a significant quarter over quarter driver. These positive drivers were partially offset by a slight decline in weather normalized retail load growth. I will provide additional details on that in a moment. Our Regulated Utilities also realized higher O&M costs during the quarter. As you will recall, in 2015, we are targeting increases of O&M cost at Regulated Utilities below the level of retail load growth. Our quarterly results were also impacted by the timing of items, including scheduled fossil plant outages, nuclear outage cost levelization and winter storm costs. We remain on track to achieve our targeted level of O&M cost during the year. Our Commercial Power business contributed to increased earnings of $0.12 per share, driven by higher results from Midwest Generation. Earnings from Midwest Generation were supported by higher PJM capacity of revenues and favorable pricing on generation volumes, without significant hedge positions. Due to the sale completion, this is the last quarter that Midwest Generation will be included in our results. Additionally, we incurred slightly lower quarterly results from our commercial renewables business due to lower wind production, which was experienced across the United States. This business remains on track to achieve its targeted $100 million of net income for 2015 as we put significant additional wind and solar capacity into service later this year. International\u2019s quarterly earnings declined by $0.13 over last year, due to the factors we have been monitoring for some time, the ongoing drought, lower electricity demand and weakening foreign currency exchange rates in Brazil as well as low MTBE prices at National Methanol that are directly correlated with Brent oil prices. Let me spend a few minutes discussing conditions in Brazil. Setting aside foreign currency, there are two key factors impacting results : generation dispatch order and demand for power. First let's discuss dispatch order. In response to the ongoing drought, generation dispatch has fundamentally changed in an effort to preserve reservoir levels. Under normal reservoir conditions, low cost hydro generation is dispatched before the higher cost thermal generation. However, since the end of the rainy season in the second quarter of 2014, the system operator has consistently dispatched thermal generation first with hydro generation being dispatched as necessary to meet system demand. As a result, the hydro generators operate less and are now at the margin bearing the risk of softening demand. This brings us to the second factor, demand for power. Brazil's slowing economy and the effective voluntary energy conservation efforts have resulted in lower demand for electricity. Brazil's demand for power has typically grown at greater than 3% over the past several years. We now expect demand growth for 2015 to be between 0% and 2%. This coupled with the impacts of the revised dispatch order results in significantly less hydro power production than in previous years. As you compare our expected results in 2015 to what we incurred in 2014, there are several factors to consider, hydro dispatch, the allocation of shared energy and market prices. First, hydro dispatch in the first quarter of 2015 was much lower than what we experienced in the same period last year. As I described earlier, hydro generation is being dispatched after thermal and we expect this dispatch order to continue throughout the remainder of the year. Secondly, in 2014, given the way the hydro system generators shape their shared energy for the year, we were allocated higher percentages of energy in the first half of the year with lesser percentages being allocated to the second half. In 2015, on the other hand, we are allocated less energy in the first half of the year and more in the back half. The combination of these factors has resulted in a short position so far in 2015, whereby contracted energy sales exceed the allocation of hydro generation. We are required to settle this short position in the market at a capped settlement price or PLD of 388 reais per megawatt hour. In contrast, in early 2014, these same factors resulted in a long position whereby the allocation of hydro generation exceeded our contracted energy sales. In this situation, we were able to sell excess energy into the spot market at a higher market price of up to 830 reais per megawatt hour. Over the remainder of the year, we expect to be in a net short position. However, the level of this short position should moderate over the second half of the year, resulting in greater comparability with the second half of 2014 and what we're seeing early in the year. We are taking actions to mitigate some of the financial exposure we are experiencing. Entering 2015, we reduced our contracted position in Brazil from 93% to 91% and we are considering further reductions to our contracted percentage for 2016, if conditions do not improve. We have also identified opportunities to achieve cost efficiencies throughout the International business and have already instituted headcount reductions of approximately 15% or over 100 positions. We will continue to evaluate further efficiencies as we move forward. We will closely monitor impacts from the deteriorating demand for electricity as well as unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate trends in Brazil. These factors will make it more challenging for International to meet its financial plan for the full year. We will continue to update you as the year progresses. Moving on to Slide 8, I\u2019ll now discuss our retail customer volume trends. As we outlined in the fourth quarter call, weather normalized load growth in 2015 is expected to be in the range of 0.5% to 1%. On a rolling 12 month basis, weather normalized retail load growth was down 0.2% through the first quarter. Weather normalized load growth for the first quarter of this year is in line with our budget. However, the comparison to the prior year is challenging, as the first quarter 2014 results included 2.6% weather normalized load growth due to the unusual impacts of last winter\u2019s Polar Vortex. Within the residential sector, we continued to experience strong growth in the number of new customers, approximately 1.2% over the year. However, customer usage trends remain challenging, leading to a decline of 1.4% in residential volumes over the rolling 12 months. This decline is primarily attributable to the strong 2014 results that was also impacted by energy efficiency as well as changing usage patterns. We continue to see favorable trends in the key indicators for the residential sector, namely full-time employment and median household income. I've discussed these metrics before and they continue to move in the right direction. Additionally, we see an increase in manufacturing jobs in our service areas, along with some positive data on new housing starts. The commercial and industrial sectors continued to show growth of 0.2% and 1.2%, respectively, over the rolling 12 months. The commercial sector is driven by declining office vacancy rates and expansion in the health and food service subsectors. As for the industrial sector, metals, transportation and chemicals continue to drive growth in the Midwest and Carolinas. One factor that we are closely monitoring is the impact of the strong US dollar which could hamper domestic manufacturing activity. We have not seen any significant impacts of this dynamic with our industrial customers to date, but we\u2019ll continue to closely monitor trends. Our economic development teams remain active, successfully helping attract new business investments into our service territories. During the quarter, these activities led to another $1.2 billion in capital investments being announced, which is expected to result in almost 3,000 new jobs across our six-state footprint. Before closing, I\u2019d like to briefly cover the mechanics of the recently launched $1.5 billion accelerated stock repurchase program, as outlined on Slide 9. In early April, after closing on the sale of the Midwest Generation business, we began the program. We immediately received and retired 16.6 million shares, which is 85% of the total expected to be retired. The program will be completed by the end of the third quarter of this year. The actual number of shares repurchased will depend upon the daily volume weighted average price of our stock during the term of the program. The timing of the close of the sale was ahead of what we planned for in our 2015 earnings guidance presented in February. This allowed us to accelerate the deployment of the proceeds and launch the share repurchase. Additionally, the Midwest Generation business contributed stronger results during the quarter than we expected, earning almost our full six-month assumption in just three months. For the full year, the early close of the sale and timing of the ASR are slightly favorable to our overall financial plan, offsetting some of the weakness being experienced at International. Slide 10 outlines our financial objectives, both shorter term and longer term. We have a strong established track record of achieving these objectives and remain on track to continue meeting them in 2015. The strength of our balance sheet underpins our ability to access the debt markets on reasonable terms. This helps fuel our growth strategy, support the dividend and maintain low cost rates for our customers. In early April, we were pleased to receive an upgrade to our credit ratings at S&P. This upgrade resolves S&P\u2019s positive outlook on the company which was initiated last fall. Related to the dividend, we have reached our target payout ratio and the Board now has the flexibility to consider growing the dividend more in line with our earnings growth over time. We are off to a strong start to the year in our Regulated business and are executing on our strategic initiatives. We are closely monitoring developing trends in our International business and are taking actions within our control to react. We expect unfavorable variability in the International business in the second quarter due to the factors I previously discussed as well as the absence of a favorable tax benefit in Chile that impacted prior year results. This negative variability to the prior year is expected to moderate in the back half of the year. We are also taking a hard look at our cost structure. We remain on track to achieve our 2015 guidance range of between $4.55 to $4.75 per share and continue to target earnings per share growth of between 4% to 6% through 2017. With that, let's open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse. Daniel Eggers : Is the usage comparison down at this point in time? Is that really just a function of the math behind the first quarter 2014 kind of trying to discern weather versus usage or is there something more structural happening? I couldn't figure out what that first quarter comp is doing to this number. Steven Young : I think that the first quarter\u2019s comps are influenced by what happened in the first quarter of 2014. Let me recap a bit. We\u2019re about flat on the rolling 12 month variance. Overall, industrial is 1.2% growth, continuing being around 1% which we\u2019ve seen really since 2011 on a consistent basis. Commercial has been growing also, it grew at about 0.2%, that\u2019s lower than what we\u2019ve seen in the past, but we continue to see in the Commercial sector some strength as vacancy rates are declining, health care and food service are strong. We did see some softening in government a bit, but overall I think with new people moving into our service territories, Commercial is poised to continue to grow. Residential is where we saw the decline. And there, I do think part of the decline in residential of 1.4%, roughly half of that you could attribute to the anomaly of the 2014 results of the Polar Vortex. There people were literally forced to stay at home due to the weather and was hard to model that accurately. When I look at residential, I do continue to see usage per customer going down due to energy efficiency, due to people living more in smaller spaces, condominiums and apartments than perhaps we\u2019ve seen in the past. But on the flip side of that, I also see that we are adding customers particularly in the Carolinas and Florida sector very strongly. We see unemployment continue to decline and median household income rise, we also see some favorable housing data, existing home sales are increasing, which should lead to some new home building. So those are factors that offset the energy usage. The question we ask is when does the saturation hit on energy efficiency at residential and when does the core growth overtake that? So we will keep an eye on those factors. But I think the fundamentals of our service area economies are ultimately very solid. Daniel Eggers : So the 0.5% to 1% makes sense on an ongoing basis. So your view is we shouldn't get too caught up in this usage comp right now because there's going to be some friction in the weather adjustments? Steven Young : That\u2019s correct. I think that will be always rolling 12 month average, the base periods going to have some of that and it\u2019s from the Polar Vortex of 2014, I think I would look at other trends there as well. And I think 0.5% to 1% is certainly still a reasonable estimate for where we are going. Lynn Good : Dan, the one thing I would add is that if we look at these results relative to how we plan the year, we\u2019re on plan, so that\u2019s another indication of the fact we think we\u2019re tracking with our expectations. Daniel Eggers : And I guess just on International, you've given the obviously slow start to the first quarter and probably rough looking second quarter, given the Brazil dynamics. What is your confidence in getting to the full-year guidance you guys have laid out for there? And if you're coming in light there, where do you see the business making up more of that earnings? Steven Young : I think the International segment will have challenges meeting their targets, which were set in February at about $345 million of net income. We recognize that and have discussed that thoroughly. I think there are offsets to that in our other businesses. We have seen favorable weather in the first quarter and that\u2019s in the bank, our ability to accelerate the share repurchase program due to the early closure of the sale is accretive to us by in the neighborhood of $0.04, we were fortunate and that we got our full earnings estimate out of the Midwest Generation business in the first quarter. It was a very good quarter for that business. So the acceleration to share repurchase should all add to the bottom line to us. So that\u2019s favorable as well. So I think you got levers in our cost structure as well to pull that can help us offset some of the shortfalls in International. Lynn Good : The other thing I would mention, Dan, is we\u2019ve been moving more rapidly to the approval process on the acquisition of the generation assets from NCEMPA. In our planning, we assumed all of that benefit was in 2016 and it looks like we\u2019re tracking ahead of that. So that\u2019s another thing I would point to. Operator : Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Shahriar Pourreza : So just on the International business, Steve, you provided pretty good sensitivities around Brent and exchange rates. Is there any way to price the risk around the weak hydrology conditions and even sort of what you're seeing from an economic development in Brazil? Steven Young : Shah, that\u2019s difficult to put a sensitivity to. It is hard to predict the impact on demand on electricity usage, it\u2019s more volatile than in the US. Last year, it was 3.7% for the entire year and it was over 7% in the first quarter and then changed throughout the year. So it\u2019s more volatile there. Additionally, it is difficult to predict what the spot pricing might be, given the lower demand, the cap is 388 reais, but where spot pricing sells under that cap was hard to know and that affects the bottom line there. So it\u2019s hard to give a sensitivity there, we\u2019ll just have to keep an eye on it as we move forward. Shahriar Pourreza : And then just in the US, seems like you're in a really good spot. You've sold the assets in the Midwest; you're doing the buyback program. Could we maybe just get a little bit of a refreshed view on your growth avenues? And maybe just focusing a little bit outside of the current gas projects, generation projects may be centered around more midstream or muni acquisitions in the area? Lynn Good : Let me take a shot and then Steve can add to it. I think around the jurisdictions on where growth is coming from and if we start in Indiana, it\u2019s grid related growth. We filed for $2 billion investment in the grid related reliability and optimization projects. That\u2019s moving through the regulatory process. We also have distribution and transmission investment in Ohio and in the remarks we mentioned the fact that under our ESP, we have an approved tracker which gives us timely recovery of those investments which we think is positive. I think in the Carolinas, you\u2019re familiar with the generating assets, gas plant, the pipeline, you\u2019re familiar with. We also are investing $500 million in solar, about half of which of that will be owned generation. And then in Florida, we have close to $2 billion in investment on generation in the Citrus County and Osprey or Swany investment. So those are the things I would point to as unfolding or moving through regulatory approval processes on each one of those. And of course, continuing to look for ways that we can put capital to work for the benefit of customers. Shahriar Pourreza : And then just one last question around the dividend, currently, maybe we could just get a viewpoint on the policy, especially as your earnings growth trajectory is where it is, kind of where you will be around the target range of where you want to be. Steven Young : Our dividend has been growing at 2% and of course our earnings have been growing in the 4% to 6% range. And that was just to help calibrate it and get back within our target range after the issues that occurred during the financial crisis and the merger with Progress. And we\u2019ve now gone to a point where we are within that target range, at the upper end of it. So our Board will consider that as we move forward, but ultimately our goal would be to have the dividend growth closer to the earnings growth rate. So that\u2019s where we are headed. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with UBS. Michael Weinstein : I was wondering if you could discuss a little bit about the puts and takes of the securitization bill in Florida for Crystal River. Lynn Good : Michael, it is a legislation that has passed both Houses. It is awaiting signature from the Governor. It is a part of a regulatory reform bill that worked its way through the House and Senate in Florida. And we see it as a great opportunity for us to bring a rate reduction to our customers, so that when the Crystal River investment goes back into rates, it will go back into rates at a lower amount for the benefit of the customers in Florida. And it does also give us accelerated recovery of the cash investment as we would securitize the investment. We still have some gates to go through, Governor\u2019s signature being one that I mentioned. We will also need to file for approval with the Florida Commission. We'll need to issue the bonds and then we will give you more perspective on where we see opportunities to put that capital to work on a go-forward basis. But this is something that I think strategically is very valuable to our utility in Florida and to our customers in Florida. Michael Weinstein : And have you had any indications at this point, this early stage, about how capital or coal ash remediation might be treated? Will it be given full base treatment or is it something that would be similarly securitized in some way? Lynn Good : We are early in the process of beginning the actual investment of dollars around the ash remediation. You may recall that our first commitment is to excavate four sites between now and 2019. In our capital plans for that period, we are at $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion for those sites and are developing plans for the remaining sites. So the spending will ramp up over the next four years, but really continue for 10 to 15 years as we address the remaining sites. Our intent would be to present these costs for review by the North Carolina Commission later in the decade when we have a regularly scheduled general base rate case. And that will be something that I would see maybe 2018, 2019. And that's the path we are on at this point, Michael. And our focus is getting the approvals from the state necessary to begin the excavation and movement of ash. And that's been our primary focus at this point. Michael Weinstein : One last question, I think you mentioned that you thought the second half of the year would be better than the first half of Brazil, I'm just wondering if you could explain that a little more. Lynn Good : We were talking about comparability to prior year, Michael, so let me ask Steve to weigh in. Steven Young : Yes. What we were referring to is, as Lynn said, comparability. I think Brazil will be challenged throughout the year because demand is lower. There have been informal rationing implementations that will affect demand as well. But it will be more comparable to the last half of 2014, as thermals were dispatched in the last half of 2014, and some the similar effects that we are seeing now started to move into place. That was the reference we are making there. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll hear from Hugh Wynne with Bernstein Research. Hugh Wynne : I wanted to follow-up on a couple of those recent questions regarding coal ash and the International operations. You mentioned that the ARO in North Carolina was about $3.5 billion. Does the Indiana ARO for coal ash removal likely to be of a similar magnitude or are you expecting it to be materially less? Steven Young : We would expect that to be less, Hugh. There's less wet tonnage of ash in Indiana, it's roughly a third and we are running numbers now. We will probably disclose a range in the upcoming 10-Q and book it in the second quarter. But it will be a smaller number than what we've seen in the Carolinas. Hugh Wynne : And are these costs, are these future removal costs primarily expenses or a very substantial portion of them likely to be capital investments? Steven Young : Hugh, the way the accounting works on coal ash here is that we will book an estimate of the liability here and the offset to that will be plant in service and assets, or for retired plants or regulatory asset. And then we will work with the regulators on recovery of these costs and effectively amortize the regulatory assets in conjunction with the regulatory treatment from the regulators. So that's the way it's going to appear on the books, primarily on the balance sheet, until we understand recovery mechanisms at this point in time. Hugh Wynne : And that will be kind of a commission-by-commission discussion, whether there's any return allowed on some portion of these outlets? Steven Young : Well, that's correct. Ultimately, the Commissions will determine what's to be recovered over what time frame, they will have great flexibility to that. And I would add, as actual costs are incurred, they will be charged against the overall liability that's booked on day one, again, balance sheet oriented until we know what the Commission recovery mechanisms are. Lynn Good : Hugh, I would think about this as a decommissioning type cost, that is something that the industry and certainly we have been aware of for decades. But we are reaching a period where not only are we retiring plants, but we now have federal legislation and in the case of North Carolina, state legislation. All of our jurisdictions have addressed federally-mandated costs in a constructive way over time. And so we are executing this to achieve closure in the time frames required and the methods required. And we will continue to update you on both the costs that we incur as well as the timing for presentation to regulators. Hugh Wynne : Just a quick question, follow-up question on Brazil, is your expectation that it's going to take a period of quarters or even years for hydroelectric output to normalize? I guess, in my mind, I'm thinking that if hydroelectric facilities are anything like bathtubs, you'd probably have to have more water go in than is coming out for the level to rise, and that might take several years of normal or above-normal hydrology. Is there a kind of a permanent, I shouldn't say permanent, is there a long-term drag to the earnings power of the hydroelectric assets in Brazil as a result of these two years of drought? Steven Young : Well, Hugh, one thing I might state there, I do believe that the Brazilian authorities will continue to run thermals through the next rainy season, which will carry you into 2016. So that will have some dampening effect on Brazil results in and of itself. Beyond that, it is hard to say what pricing might be contracting levels and demand might be. Brazil has a number of issues going on politically, social unrest, et cetera, that could affect these results. But the one thing I would say is I do think thermals will be dispatched through another rainy season. Lynn Good : And Hugh, we have in the slide deck, back in the appendix, sort of a tracking at the reservoir level. I think to your point, the reservoirs are low, but they're moving up. I think the rainy season in 2015 will be extraordinarily important. And the system operator is using thermals as a method of restoring those reservoirs. That, coupled with weakened demand, is increasing the reservoir level. And I think that ultimately will be a big indicator of how long the country continues to experience the effects of the drought. Hugh Wynne : Can you provide any color on your comment regarding the threat of debarment and what impact that might have on contracts with the military or other elements of your Commercial business? Lynn Good : And so this is a consequence, Hugh, of the plea in the investigation that we entered into in February. And we have been working actively through reaching an agreement on this, and have a hope and expectation we can finalize by May 14. But if not, we will continue to move forward working to resolve this issue. It only relates to new and modified contracts. So we do not see an impact in our ability to provide power to the important bases that are in our service territories. We do not see any material financial or operational impact as a result. But it's a consequence, we need to work through it and that's what we are focused on. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll hear from Chris Turnure with JPMorgan. Christopher Turnure : I wanted to circle back to Florida and the securitization of the Crystal River 3 money. Was this expected by you guys? How does it fit into your financing plans over the next couple of years and your prior statement that you don't need equity through 2017, I think and also could you quantify the potential number for the securitization for us? Steven Young : Some of the facts there, I think the securitization will be around $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion. And the way it will mechanically work, as Lynn said, early in 2016, if things move along properly, is when the securitization would occur. But the proceeds will be used, half of the proceeds will displace and take out some operating company level debt down at Duke Energy Florida. The remaining half proceeds will be dividended up to the parent and will be used to help fund and finance growth projects. And this was not in our initial financing plan that we presented back in February. Christopher Turnure : And then going back to the North Carolina muni purchase, you mentioned it's going along a little bit faster than you had originally anticipated. What's the potential timing there for final closure now? I guess it's at some point before year-end, but when do you think specifically the NRC will come out with their decision? And then also my understanding was that you didn't need any kind of specified regulatory recovery mechanism there, but you got this rider in the legislation that was signed early last month. Could you just clarify that a little bit and if anything has changed versus how you expected to recover the assets? Lynn Good : So I think, Chris, you've got the elements there. There are three approvals required, NRC, and we are hopeful that that will move through over a few months. So we expect that to be before the end of the year. The thing that's interesting about the NRC approval, these are plants we already operate. We operate the Brunswick and Harris plants. So we will be working through that diligently to secure that approval. Then the 32 municipalities need to approve. We think that will occur quite quickly over the next month or so. And then we need approval from the NCUC. The rider mechanism that you talked about has already been approved through the legislature, so it will be a matter of implementation here in the state. So when we look at the big issues that were obstacles to closing, it was FERC approval and it was legislation. We've cleared those. And so the ones that remain, we think, can go rather quickly, giving us an opportunity to close sooner than we anticipated. Christopher Turnure : So the rider doesn't improve your outlook in any way? That was expected and that's required to close and it's all set? Lynn Good : It is, from a cash standpoint, it's a rider, so you get more timely recovery, cash recovery, Chris, and we would always have assumed that we could record some return. Steven Young : And from an earnings standpoint, the profitability from this is the tended wholesale contract with these same municipalities. They were self-supplying when they owned the asset; we bought the asset. We will now supply them at a FERC-regulated rate. We purchased the asset at a price that did not distort retail rates in any fashion. So it's fairly revenue neutral there. The profitability is on the large wholesale contract that follows it. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll hear from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Jonathan Arnold : Could you just remind us, as you're thinking about the plan today, how important to the 4% to 6% through 2017 this 0.5% to 1% sales growth is? I appreciate there's some noise in the numbers right now. And maybe just related to that, I know you said you're going to take a deep look at the cost structure. Are you kind of positioning for an eventuality where if the sales growth doesn't materialize, just how should we think about those pieces? Steven Young : Sensitivity, Jonathan, on the sales growth that we've thrown out is that a 1% organic retail load growth would translate into roughly 2% earnings growth. So that's a metric to give you an idea of what it means in terms of earnings per share and growth trends and that kind of thing. So it's obviously critical for us, particularly between rate cases to see load growth from our organic businesses there. In terms of do we anticipate a downturn there? I think the 0.5% to 1% is still a reasonable growth trend to project on. We are always looking at our cost structures and trying to find flexibility. We are a large company with a lot of different operations and we have levers that we can pull. Jonathan Arnold : But you're not considering starting to plan off of a lower number to just have a bit more comfort that you can hit this number or is that, at this stage, not saying that, by the sound of it? Steven Young : No, it's too early to try to move in any direction on that. I think the growth estimates are reasonable given what we are seeing, but we are always trying to prepare and be ready for other circumstances. Jonathan Arnold : And then just one other on International, I was just curious, you're talking about headcount reductions. Just given the nature of the business, predominantly hydro footprint, what kind of flexibility do you really have there? And how should we think about how that changes the positioning of business going forward? Steven Young : I think in terms of cost reductions, we have identified over 100 positions. There's various administrative, corporate office type positions that are examined and support roles. So that has been acted upon and will help offset some of the losses. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Paul Ridzon : A quick question. Steve, I think I heard you say that the strength at merchant and the ASR will offset some of the pain in International? Steven Young : Yes, that's correct. Paul Ridzon : And then just a clarification, did you say the ASR happening sooner than anticipated was $0.04 accretive to previous use or is it $0.04 absolute? Steven Young : It's $0.04 to the plan that we had submitted. And let me give a discussion here. In the first quarter, our Midwest operation earned, it provided earnings that were equal to what we projected for a six-month period. We had, in February, projected that the sale would occur and close mid-year. And so we had the Midwest Generation in our results for six months and about $95 million of earnings during those six months. They got those earnings in the first quarter and then we closed the deal. That allowed us to accelerate the timing of the initiation of the share repurchase. And the share repurchase provides benefits to us happening earlier, roughly one quarter earlier, within the neighborhood of $0.04 compared to our original plan. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Paul Patterson : Almost all my questions have been answered. Just to clarify, though, you guys said that you are taking a hard look at your costs. And Jonathan asked about this. I just am wondering, though, you guys are always probably taking a hard look at your costs. I mean, is there anything that we might think of as being potential cost cutting program, et cetera, that could, in case whatever, some factor here or there doesn't work, that could help you meet the numbers if there was a hiccup, let's say, more International or sales growth, whatever, I'm just wondering, do you see it \u2013 is there something new that you're identifying or how can you \u2013 could you just elaborate a little bit on that? Lynn Good : I'll take a shot, Paul, and Steve can certainly chime in. I think this organization has demonstrated great discipline with cost. And when you think about where we've come post-merger integration projects, corporate center benefits, moving into the operations, consolidating work management tools, the nuclear fleet, working together over a several year period, we continue to look for ways to optimize our investment and optimize the operation of our business. And that is not going to change. And so I would not point to any single thing. I would just point to ongoing financial discipline. When we make commitments, our expectation is that we will deliver those commitments using all the levers that exist in the company. And making the right risk reward trade-offs, because, at the end of the day, we want to provide reliable service, maintain a safe operation and commitment to employees. So it's no one thing, but it's just ongoing financial discipline. Operator : Our next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Travis Miller : I was wondering going back to the retail usage trends, particularly on the residential side, I suppose. Are you seeing any kind of penetration on distributed generation at all and what might change that? Lynn Good : It's modest at this point. So we are a company with 7.2 million meters. We serve about 20 million to 25 million customers and we have about 5,000 to 5,500 rooftop installations. I do think that there is an ongoing interest on the part of customers to pursue distributed generation when it makes sense for them. I think the one distinction that I might make in many of our service territories, our retail rates are extraordinarily competitive. We are 20% below the national average here in the Carolinas, as an example. So the economics have not been as favorable as they might be in other jurisdictions where the prices are just frankly higher. So we think about our renewable strategy for the company, including economic forms of renewable investment, it's in primarily utility scale up to this point, but we do believe customers will have an interest over time if the economics continue to improve on distributed generation. Travis Miller : And then I wonder if you could give an update on the Atlantic Coast pipeline, that, or even the projects that you have related to that? Lynn Good : So the Atlantic Coast pipeline is moving through its early-stage development process with open houses, surveying, engineering work, still targeting a FERC filing later this year, with construction hopefully beginning in 2016, 2017. So it's on track and enjoys very strong support here in North Carolina, represents important infrastructure for the eastern part of the state not only to enable electric generation, but also for industrial growth. Travis Miller : Do you wait for the FERC filing and any kind of approvals there before you start any kind of projects, power generation, et cetera, that would tie into that pipeline or is that something you can start before that? Lynn Good : So we look at that infrastructure as being infrastructure that we are building over time, not for any one plant but to continue to provide diversification supply and infrastructure over time. So we've built five combined cycles over the last three to five years. We have another one planned for 2018. And all of those over time underpin this infrastructure, but I wouldn't tie any given plant to the expansion. Operator : Our next question comes from Ashar Khan with Visium. Ashar Khan : Just wanted to get a sense of on the \u2013 you mentioned the $0.05 to $0.10 on the North Carolina, the municipal acquisitions. Can you just remind us why there's this variance of $0.05 to $0.10, how we can end up at $0.10 versus $0.05? Steven Young : What we\u2019re thinking about there is basically the financing of it. It's roughly a $1.2 billion investment. Half of that will be through Opco debt and absorbed in the retail and wholesale rates. The other $600 million is the $0.05 to $0.10 range, dependent on, it was financed with cash or with equity. We are not going to issue equity here, but that just gives you an idea of the range. I would think about that more in the midpoint of that range in terms of what it's really going to yield. Operator : That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back over to Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks. Lynn Good : So thank you all for joining us today, for your interest and investment in Duke Energy. I think we'll see a number of you maybe in May at conferences, but we'll look forward to our second quarter earnings call on August 6. So thank you for joining us today. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Operator : Good day and welcome to this Duke Energy Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bill Currens. Please go ahead, sir. Bill Currens - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's second quarter 2015 earnings review and business update. Leading our call is Lynn Good, President and CEO, along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the Safe Harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today's materials. Please note that the appendix to today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures to help you analyze the company's performance. As summarized on slide three, Lynn will begin with an update on our principal strategic, operational and financial activities since our last call, then Steve will provide an overview of our second quarter financial results, including updates on economic activities within our service territories, as well as conditions in Brazil. With that, I'll turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Before I start today, I'd like to take a moment to introduce Doug Esamann. Doug recently joined our senior management team and will oversee our Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky and Florida utilities. Doug has over 30 years of experience with Duke Energy, most recently as the President of our Indiana utility. Doug's depth of regulatory experience as well as his customer and strategic focus complements our leadership team. We look forward to introducing Doug to many of you over the coming months. Now, to the quarter. We are midway through 2015 and continue to execute our operational and strategic growth objectives while positioning the company to meet our financial objectives for the year. This morning, we reported second quarter 2015 adjusted EPS of $0.95, which is consistent with our plan. Our regulated and commercial businesses have performed well over the first half of the year. Additionally, we have completed the sale of the Midwest Generation and the purchase of the NCEMPA assets ahead of schedule. This has allowed us to effectively offset the challenging business environment in Brazil. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our full-year 2015 earnings guidance range of $4.55 to $4.75 per share. In June, we completed our $1.5 billion accelerated stock repurchase ahead of schedule. Further, last month, we announced that the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend to $0.825 per share doubling the annual growth rate to around 4%. This increase reflects our confidence in the strength of our core business and our cash flows. Our balance sheet provides continued support for growth in the dividend. For the past 89 years, the dividend has demonstrated our commitment to delivering attractive total returns to shareholders. I am pleased with the company's operational performance during the quarter, particularly our response to the extended heat wave in the Carolinas in June. Temperatures were in the upper 90s for much of the month and our system met the increased demand for our customers. In June, we used a record monthly amount of natural gas, approximately 25 Bcf, surpassing the previous month high of 20 Bcf set in July of 2014. Additionally, our nuclear fleet delivered a record second quarter in terms of net megawatt hours of generation. Nuclear capacity factor was around 95% during the month of June. Lastly, our field operations teams met customer needs during the stress of the summer heat and storms. Our ability to meet extreme demand conditions demonstrates the quality of our operations. We've made significant headway on other strategic and regulatory priorities, which I'll briefly cover on slide five. These priorities include investments in new generation, infrastructure and a focus on environmental compliance. Beginning with our investments in new generation. Just last week, we closed on the $1.25 billion acquisition of jointly owned generating assets from the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency. We closed ahead of schedule, after receiving the required approval sooner than expected. This reflects the mutually beneficial nature of the acquisition and the widespread support we received here in North Carolina. We immediately began supplying power to the 32 municipalities through a long-term wholesale contract. In 2015, we expect a $0.04 earnings per share benefit based upon an expected full year EPS impact of around $0.07 to $0.08. During the second quarter, we also announced the $1.1 billion Western Carolinas Modernization Project. This project includes the early retirement of our Asheville coal plant, which will be replaced by a new 650 megawatt combined-cycle gas plant. We will also build new transmission assets that will improve reliability in the region. Finally, we will install solar generation at the site. The new gas plant is expected in service by the end of 2019 and the entire project will likely be completed by 2020. Before construction begins, various regulators including the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the Carolinas Utility Commissions will need to approve the plan. Our commercial renewables business continues to deliver on its capital growth projects. In April, we completed the 200-megawatt Los Vientos III project in South Texas, which is now delivering power under a long-term contract with Austin Energy. In July, we announced acquisitions of an additional 70 megawatts of solar capacity in California and North Carolina. Our commercial renewables business now has more than 2,000 megawatts of capacity in operation. In July, FERC approved our application to acquire the 599 megawatt combined-cycle Osprey gas plant in Florida from Calpine. The Florida Public Service Commission also voted to approve the acquisition. We remain on track to close by January of 2017 when our existing PPA with Calpine terminates and we have a need for additional generation capacity. Also in Florida, we announced an agreement to purchase a 7.5% stake in the Sabal Trail gas pipeline from Spectra Energy for $225 million. Similar to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, the Sabal Trail investment will be a part of Duke's Commercial portfolio. The pipeline is expected in service by the end of 2017 and will serve the growing natural gas needs in the state, including our 1,640 megawatt Citrus County combined-cycle plant, which is expected to be online in 2018. Duke Energy Florida and Florida Power & Light have entered into 25-year capacity agreements with the pipeline. Moving to Indiana, in May, we received an order from the Indiana Commission on the transmission and distribution infrastructure plan. The Commission denied our proposed $1.9 billion investment because they would like to see greater detail. We are working on a revised plan, which we expect to file with the Commission by the end of 2015. Modernizing our electric grid will provide great benefits to customers in Indiana, ultimately increasing reliability, decreasing the duration of power outages and improving customer communication. In the second quarter, we made significant progress on coal ash management activities. In May, we began moving ash at our River Bend site in North Carolina after receiving state permits. We are now excavating ash at three sites in the Carolinas. In June, we announced recommendations to fully excavate 12 additional ash basins in North Carolina, bringing the total ash in the Carolinas we have slated for excavation to about 30%. The remaining ash basins are being further studied to determine appropriate closure methods. We are pursuing solutions that balance safety, environmental stewardship and cost effectiveness. Given our efforts over the past year, we are ahead of the curve in adapting to changing regulations our industry faces with ash management. On the subject of environmental rules, on Monday, the U.S. EPA finalized a Clean Power Plan, a regulation aimed at reducing carbon emissions from existing power plants 32% by 2030. The guidelines issued this week are more than 1,500 pages long and among the more complex rules in recent history. This rule sets state specific reduction targets and builds upon the substantial progress we have already made to reduce our environmental footprint. Since 2005, we have reduced our total carbon dioxide emissions by 22% through retirement of older coal units, the transition to cleaner burning natural gas, as well as investments in renewables and energy efficiency. Our plans continue to move us toward a lower carbon future. We will work constructively with our states to identify solutions that preserve the reliability and affordability our customers expect. As we continue to modernize our system, managing energy diversity will be an important consideration. As I look back over the first half of 2015, I am pleased with what we've accomplished on multiple fronts across the business. I'm even more pleased with the groundwork we're laying for the years ahead. We're making strategic long-term investments that will benefit our customers and communities, in addition to supporting growth for shareholders. We're developing and executing strategies that will position the company well in a rapidly changing industry. Now, I'll turn the call over to Steve to discuss the quarter in more detail. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thanks, Lynn. Today, I'll review our second quarter financial results and discuss the economic conditions in our service territories. I will also provide an update on the accounting and expected costs for our coal ash management activities, and review our results in Brazil. Let's start with the quarterly results. I will cover the highlights on slide six. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release. As Lynn mentioned, we achieved second quarter adjusted diluted earnings of $0.95 per share, compared to $1.11 in the second quarter of 2014. On a reported basis, 2015 second quarter earnings per share were $0.78 compared to $0.86 last year. A reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results is included in the supplemental materials to today's presentation. Regulated Utilities adjusted results declined by $0.09 per share, primarily due to a prior year favorable state tax settlement, planned timing of O&M cost, and higher depreciation and amortization. O&M cost increased this quarter due to the planned timing of outages across the generation fleet, and approximately $0.05 due to nuclear outage cost levelization impacts recognized in the prior year. This is the last quarter in which we expect nuclear outage cost levelization to be a significant driver over the prior year results. We are on track to achieve our targeted full-year O&M budget, and continue to look for opportunities to reduce costs. These negative drivers were partially offset by higher margins, resulting from growth in wholesale contracts and weather normal retail sales. We had favorable weather in the quarter, as a significant heat wave gripped the Carolinas in June. Weather added around $0.03 over last year's second quarter, and $0.06 compared to normal conditions. We also experienced higher earnings of $0.03 this quarter from pricing and riders, primarily due to increased energy efficiency programs. International's quarterly earnings declined $0.13 over last year, due to factors we continue to monitor, including the economic conditions and lower demand for electricity in Brazil. As you will recall, International also had a favorable income tax adjustment of $0.07 in last year's quarter, associated with the reorganization of our operations in Chile. Our Commercial Portfolio, formerly Commercial Power, is primarily made up of our commercial renewables business. In the second quarter, we incurred slightly lower earnings due to lower wind production. This decrease in wind production was experienced broadly across the United States. Turning to slide seven, I'll now provide some insight into the second half of 2015, and the key drivers that give us confidence in our 2015 guidance range of $4.55 to $4.75 per share. Through the first half of the year, our adjusted earnings per share of $2.20 is consistent with our plan. The regulated business has experienced favorable weather, and has seen strong growth in wholesale contracts and weather normal retail sales. The sale of the Midwest Generation fleet, as a whole, has been favorable to our plan in the first half of the year. These positive drivers have helped offset continued weakness at International. In order to achieve our full-year 2015 earnings guidance range, we expect higher EPS contributions in the back half of the year, over what we earned in the comparable period last year. There are a few primary drivers that support this. First, we expect continued growth in contracted wholesale volumes, as well as organic growth in retail demand over the last half of the year. Second, we experienced unfavorable weather last year in the third quarter. Assuming normal weather for the remainder of this year provides an uplift of $0.05. Third, the early completion of the NCEMPA asset purchase will provide an additional earnings per share impact of around $0.04. Earnings from our Commercial renewables business should also see an improvement in the second half of the year. We are on track to put over 200 megawatts of additional wind and solar capacity into service later this year, which would bring 2015's total additions to more than 400 megawatts. Related to O&M cost, we expect third quarter O&M to be higher than the prior year, while fourth quarter should be lower. As a result, O&M shouldn't be a significant driver in the second half of the year. Similarly, we expect International's earnings contribution in the second half of 2015 to be comparable to last year. This is not a full list of drivers for the rest of the year, but these represent variances that are likely to occur, based on current expectations. As you are all aware, the third quarter is historically our strongest quarter. We will be in a position to provide more insight into the year after we see those results. Moving on to slide eight, I'll now discuss our retail customer volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather normalized retail load growth increased by positive 0.1%, driven by strong second quarter growth of positive 1.7%. This was the first quarter we have experienced positive growth across all customer classes in over a year. Although one quarter does not make a trend, this recent uptick is encouraging. Within the residential sector, we continued to experience strong growth in the number of new customers, approximately 1.3% over the same period last year. The growth in the Carolinas and Florida regions has been particularly strong, at around 1.5%. The Carolinas and Florida also saw usage per customer level off, after trending lower over the past several quarters. We continue to see favorable trends in the key indicators for the residential sector including, employment, median incomes and household formations. In fact, the 6 states we serve captured over 20% of the additional nonfarm job growth over the last year. The commercial sector grew by 0.3% on a rolling 12-month basis. This sector continues to benefit from declining office vacancy rates, and expansion in the medical and restaurant subsectors. We've also experienced some growth in the tourism related businesses, in certain markets. The industrial sector grew by 1.3% on a rolling 12-month basis. This growth was led by metals, transportation, construction and chemicals. Additionally, we are starting to see textiles in the Carolinas build momentum. We will continue to monitor the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar on manufacturing activity. Our economic development teams remain active, successfully helping attract new business investments into our service territories. So far this year, these activities have led to the announcement of another $1.7 billion in capital investments, which is expected to result in over 5,000 new jobs, across our six states. We are encouraged by the continued strengthening of the economy, particularly in the Southeast. We remain on track to achieve our full-year 2015 weather normalized load growth of between 0.5% and 1%. Moving on to slide nine. Let me update you on our coal ash management activities. First I'll cover adjustments to our asset retirement obligations related to coal ash basin closures. As you'll recall, in the third quarter 2014, we recorded an approximate $3.5 billion ARO, reflecting our best estimate to comply with the newly enacted Coal Ash Management Act or CAMA. In April, the U.S. EPA published its final Coal Combustion Residuals Rule in the Federal Register. The EPA's final rule is consistent with our compliance plan for basins in North Carolina under CAMA. However, the final rule did create a legal obligation related to ash basins outside of North Carolina and existing landfills across our system. Therefore during the second quarter, we recorded an additional $1 billion obligation representing our best estimate of cost to comply with the new Federal EPA rules. As of June 30, we now have total ARO obligations of $4.5 billion, which represents our best estimate to comply with state and Federal rules. These costs will be spent over the next several decades. We will continue to refine this estimated liability as plans are finalized. Next, let me summarize our cash spending assumptions for our coal ash activities. In February, we estimated $1.3 billion in spending from 2015 to 2019, to close the initial high-priority sites under CAMA. During the quarter we announced our recommendation to fully excavate 12 additional basins in the Carolinas. Our estimate of cost to close these additional basins ranges between $700 million to $1 billion. Ultimately, we expect these costs will increase our five year capital spending plan that was disclosed in February. However, we are unable to predict the precise timing under which we will incur these costs until the final risk classification is set by the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the Coal Ash Commission. We will continue to provide updates as our plans become finalized. There is still work to do with our remaining basins and we will keep you updated as we continue to refine our estimates. Taking a look at slide 10. Let me provide an update on our International business. As we entered the year, we anticipated challenges at International due to one, the prolonged drought conditions in Brazil, causing thermals to dispatch of hydros for the entire year. Two, unfavorable Brazilian foreign exchange rates. Three, declining earnings contributions from our interest in National Methanol, which sells products that are correlated to Brent crude oil prices. And four, a prior year Chilean tax benefit. We also assume no energy rationing and around 2% growth in demand for electricity. During 2015, reservoir levels continue to be low. Rainfall has recently been above average in the Southeast region of Brazil, where our assets are located. Reservoir levels stood at about 37% at the end of July, higher than the 20% level they started the year. However, they are still low for this time of the year. These conditions have caused the system operator to continue to dispatch thermals ahead of hydros. Additionally, the government is continuing to encourage customers to voluntarily reduce electricity consumption. The economy in Brazil continues to weaken as evidenced by S&Ps recent change in outlook for the country's credit ratings. The softer Brazilian economy, higher tariff prices for end users and the voluntary conservation measures have placed additional pressure on electricity demand so far in 2015. As a result, we now expect 2015 electricity demand in Brazil to be lower than 2014. Taking this all into account through the second quarter of 2015, International's earnings have declined by $0.26 per share, compared to last year. As you will recall, our original full year forecast of International contemplated about $0.12 per share of lower year-over-year earnings. We do not expect these levels of year-over-year weakness to continue into the second half of 2015. We expect the third and fourth quarters to be more comparable to the second half of 2014 for the following reasons : First, the system operator began to change the dispatch order to the detriment of hydro generators in the second quarter of 2014. So in the second half of 2015, generation dispatch order will be similar to what it was in the second half of 2014. Second, the shaping of our contract should create a less significant short position in the second half of the year than we saw last year. Finally, we have seen recent declines in the market settlement prices or PLD. In June and July, these prices fell below the established ceiling of R$388, averaging approximately R$300 per megawatt hour. These lower spot prices should provide some relief as we continue to cover our short position through market purchases, helping offset the impact of lower demand. Our International team continues to manage well in this difficult environment, concentrating on items within their control. We actively are managing our ongoing contracted levels and focusing on our cost management during this downturn. However, we do not expect International to meet its original financial plan for the full year. Before moving on, let me mention a recent development in Brazil that has received some media attention. There have been recent discussions aimed at providing some financial relief to the hydro generators. These discussions are in the early stages and it is difficult to speculate on how they may play out. We'll keep you updated as events unfold. Slide 11 outlines our financial objectives. The balance sheet is strong and our credit ratings are in line with our target levels, allowing the company to access the financial markets on reasonable terms. We are executing our plan to access $2.7 billion of international cash over several years. In June, we returned approximately $1.2 billion to the U.S. The strength of our balance sheet and cash flows helps fuel our growth strategy, support the dividend and maintain low cost rates for our customers. Our dividend continues to be a very important piece of our shareholder value proposition. In July, we were pleased to announce an increase in our quarterly dividend growth rate from 2% to approximately 4%. In 2010, we have been working to reach our target payout ratio of 65% to 70% of adjusted EPS. Now that we are at the high end of that ratio, we will continue to target dividend growth more in line with our long-term earnings growth targets. Let me provide an update on our earnings growth objectives, both short term and long term. We are on track to achieve our 2015 guidance range of $4.55 to $4.75 per share. Near-term headwinds at the International business have been offset by strength in Regulated Utilities and early execution on some of our strategic initiatives. On a longer term basis, we continue to target earnings per share growth of 4% to 6%, underpinned by the strength of our domestic businesses. We are executing on our strategic growth initiatives, which provides a foundation for growth through 2017 and beyond. Our International business however, continues to face unfavorable macroeconomic trends such as poor hydrological conditions and a weakened economy in Brazil. As we look beyond 2015, the extent and duration of these challenges is uncertain. We will learn more as the year progresses, and we'll evaluate the longer term impacts as we finalize our financial plans for 2016 and beyond. We remain committed to delivering long-term value for our investors. With that, let's open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. And we will first go to Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse. Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey. Good morning, guys. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Dan. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Hello, Dan. Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey. On the load growth numbers in the second quarter, I guess both customer gains, weather adjusted usage, both looked pretty good and kind of broke from trend that we've seen the last couple quarters. Should we read much into things getting better and this being perpetuated or this is just kind of the \u2013 some of the volatility that comes with quarterly adjustments in numbers? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Well, Dan, as we said, I'm always careful when I just look at one quarter's results. I think we have to always have that in the back of our mind. We are seeing some pretty good trends here, though on a few factors that I will mention. The growth of customers into the Carolinas and Florida has been ramping up from 1% now to 1.5% and that's got to be a good metric there for the future as we move forward. We're also seeing some favorable statistics when we look at new housing starts in our service territories, meaning new homes are starting to get actually built. We're also starting to see a lower number of rejections of mortgage applications which say that people are having the funds to buy a home or a place to live, some of those statistics are certainly compelling. We're always cautiously optimistic on one quarter, but there are some good results here. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: And Dan, one thing I would add that Steve talked about in the script, we've been tracking lower usage per customer kind of quarter-after-quarter and actually, saw a leveling-off of that reduction this quarter as well, which is another thing that I would point to as a bit of a new trend for us. Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): When we think about the load growth and you guys were at 0.5% to 1%, this year, I know you've kind of talked about 1% being more of a normalized long-term target. How important is getting to that 1% number to the utilities being able to support their end of the 4% to 6% growth target? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: It's important, Dan. As you know on our sensitivity, a 1% increase in our organic load growth would translate to about 2% earnings growth, and it is essential to us to see growth in our service areas. Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): The trends you're seeing right now, are they giving you encouragement that that 1% is feeling a little bit better, after maybe feeling a bit shaky the last couple quarters? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Well, as I mentioned, I think some of these trends behind the good quarter we had in the second quarter do make us feel well. As Lynn mentioned, the usage decline stopping per customer and some of the raw data on employment, median household income starting to pick-up and get a bit of traction in our service territories, do give us some comfort there. Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. I'm sure that folks are going to ask about it, but just on the international side. Looking past this year, are you guys thinking that things that are happening this year are structural, or do you think they're situational to these market conditions? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Dan, I think there are a combination of things going on. The hydrological conditions, I believe were seasonal, right. So, if we have a strong rainy season that starts in the fall, continuing into 2016, we may see a situation where dispatch order changes. I think the regulatory body in Brazil has learned a lot about the changing generation mix and how that fleet has reacted in this environment. So, over maybe a short-term to medium-term, we could see some mitigation of some of the pressures there, or changes in regulation that could be helpful to the hydro operators. I think the long-term issues are more around the Brazilian economy. And does the Brazilian economy get traction again, and start growing at a pace that would be more consistent with what we have seen over the last decade? So, I think you've got a combination of shorter-term and medium-term to longer term issues. And so, our focus is to be as transparent as we can on what we see, and we'll continue to update you as the year progresses. Dan L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Very good. Thank you, guys. Operator : Next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hello. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Shar. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Steve, I think you sort of touched on this in your prepared remarks, but on the injunctions in Brazil, is there preliminary, is there any procedural process that we could follow to see how things are transpiring? And then the second question is, Brazil does have relatively high rates. So is there any talk on how \u2013 the potential of passing these costs onto customers? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yeah, Shar, on the injunctions, in talking with our teams in Brazil, I don't know that there is a set timeframe or schedule that you can look to to determine resolution of this. I think these initial injunctions and discussions around the market by various stakeholder groups are a positive step. But we expect that it will take quite a bit of time to resolve this issue and get new processes and settlements in place. So that's just the nature of the way these negotiations often go in Brazil. So I wouldn't look for a timeframe there. Regarding Brazilian retail rates, they did jump up quite a bit over the past year. And certainly that is something that is on the minds of Brazilian politicians, as to, how do we deal with the cost of this out of dispatch situation due to the hydrology issues? And right now, the hydro generators are bearing a lot of that burden, and the customers have borne some burden as well. That's part of the debate that will be worked upon over the next year or so in Brazil. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it. Got it. And then, on slide 11, you added a new footnote, footnote 3. Just curious, this footnote, is it basically inferring that the 4% to 6% is embedding some of the challenges you're seeing in the International business, or it's sort of pending some of the challenges that you're seeing in the International business? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: You know, Shar, what I would say is, given the depth of the challenge we've experienced during the first six months, and the fact that we've seen hydrological conditions, really coupled with some of the complexities around other economic factors, including Petrobras and other things going on in Brazil. That the duration of this challenge is uncertain to us as we look past 2015. So when we look at the back half, we believe the back half of 2015 will be reasonably comparable to 2014. We'll be anxious to see how the rainy season begins, but we need more information and time to look at our forecast for 2016 and 2017. And so, we wanted to just provide some transparency on that, and that's the \u2013 really consistent with the remarks we shared with you today. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it. Got it. And then just lastly, weaker wind resources was a little bit of a theme this quarter. Is this something that we should think about from a structural standpoint, just given that the El Ni\u00f1o cycle is just starting, or is this something that's sort of a bit of an anomaly? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: I don't know that I've heard anybody profess to understand the wind patterns that well, Shar, that they could predict them. So I don't know that it's anything more than an anomaly now. We're heading into the second half of the year, where the wind traditionally picks up. So we'll get a better idea after that. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Excellent. Thanks very much. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Greg. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Hey, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : So, I just wanted to go over some of the things you said, just to make sure I understand them in terms of looking on actually slide 14, which is your original assumptions put up against your year-to-date results. It looks like you're basically telling us that if International is flat in the second half versus the second half last year, that you're $0.10 behind plan. On the other hand, you're saying you're $0.04 ahead of plan at the utility because of the early close of the NCEMPA acquisition and then you're also \u2013 see better results in the second half versus the second half of last year in the Commercial business because of the 400 megawatts of new renewables and that's how you sort of get back to plan. Is that a reasonable summary of what you said or am I missing something? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: I think you've hit on some of the elements there. Assuming normal weather over the last half of the year, and we have had warm weather in July, you get a pick up there. Certainly, the wholesale contract associated with the NCEMPA acquisition provides about $0.04 there. We've also seen growth in our retail load year-over-year, even at modest percents that can add several cents to it. If it stayed like the second quarter's results, it would be more than that. Our wholesale business has also picked up through new contracts with co-ops and munis in the Carolinas and in Florida in particular. So, those are some of the things that we look to to continue provide growth over the second half of the year. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: And, Greg... Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. I understand that. I guess to clarify my question, many of those things were baked into the $2.95 billion budget. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Yes. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : I assume normal weather was baked in there. The wholesale pickup was \u2013 you were very, very clear on in your disclosures on the expectation there. So, I'm just focused on what's changed from the plan. I guess you're a little bit ahead of normal going into July which is good, NCEMPA closed early which is good. So, I'd really like to circle back to your answer and focus on what's changed that's not in the plan. $0.04 from NCEMPA... Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: So, let me give it a try. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Yeah, Greg, let me \u2013 so, if we step back from this, as we started the year, we expected the back half to be stronger than the first half from the get-go. And then, if you look at the first half of the year, the weakness in Brazil has basically been offset by strength in the regulated business. We had weather that was strong and comparable to last year, even a bit ahead. We had an early closing in the Midwest Generation sale, which gives us incremental. When you go to the back half, we expect the back half to be stronger, wholesale growth, retail growth. Our O&M outage was more in the first half than the second half. And then, we have the sweetener of the NCEMPA transaction closing. And so, the weakness that we offset in the first half with weather and strong results, we don't expect to see in the back half because we think Brazil will be comparable to 2014. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. And that 400 megawatts... Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Does that help? Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : ...of new renewables coming in, in the back half of the year is baked into your $185 million plan or is that stuff...? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: It is. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yes, it is. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. Great. That's much clearer. Thank you very much. Have a good morning. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Julien. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : So, perhaps to follow-up on Greg's question just a little bit and be clear. First, where do you stand in the context of 2015, if you can specify? And then, perhaps more broadly as you think about the 4% to 6%, is there any thought or expectation to update that and specifically rebase at any point or how do you think about that given where you stand on hydro and obviously 2015 is \u2013 could be a weather event related, but I'd be curious if you want to just elaborate on the 4% to 6% at this point too? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: So, Julien, we are on plan through the first half. And for the reasons we just discussed, we're confident we'll remain within the range of $4.55 to $4.75. In terms of guidance, our current thinking is that we will approach that in the same way we always do. So, you'll have February of 2016 for 2016 and for the longer-term outlook. We will continue to update you in third quarter on any further developments we see in any part of the business as we also normally do. So that's the schedule we're thinking about at this point. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. But perhaps just more specifically, rebasing, is there any thought process of rebasing the base year of that 4% to 6% at all? And then, perhaps the second bigger picture question if you will, with regards to the Clean Power Plan and I know, obviously incredibly complex as you already alluded to. Could you elaborate how the company is positioning to capture opportunities there and obviously you're involved in many of the key angles that would benefit in theory from the CPP, but could you elaborate how you are thinking about taking advantage of each of those respective niches? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: And on rebasing, Julien, we're anchored in 2013 at this point. We will rebase at some point. We haven't made a final decision on that and we'll update guidance in February of 2016. The Clean Power Plan appreciates those questions and we are continuing to digest, we do not have a definitive plan in any of our jurisdictions. Of course it will impact our IRP planning, and impact our thinking on state-by-state. As I'm sure you're aware, the plan did change emission reduction targets. So we have more stringent targets in the Midwest. We have moderately less stringent targets in the Southeast, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida. There's a notion being introduced of a market trading platform, which is new, which we'll need to evaluate, and then the compliance period with these incentive credits and so on, in 2020, 2021, I think, will also be something that we digest. So, we're beginning to understand the elements, I think there is flexibility here. It will be important to involve a stakeholder and state process. These are the states' implementation plans ultimately. But we believe that much as we've delivered consistent carbon reductions over the last 10 years, we'll be looking for a way to continue progress in that direction, at the lowest cost to our customers. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Steve. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, Lynn. A couple questions. First, just specific details. So, I think you guys said, you expect it to be $0.12 down in 2015 in International versus 2014 and in the first half, you're down $0.26. So, assuming it's flat the rest of the year, that means you're kind of off by about $0.14 from plan. Could you maybe just break up, what makes up that $0.14, how much is it below average? How much is it the hydro versus some of the other, the economy or currency or other things, at least a rough cut of that? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yeah, Steve. The bulk of that is \u2013 and you're just talking about International, the delta in International? Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yes. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: From the original expectations versus where we're at now, is that correct? Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yes. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yes. The biggest difference that we're seeing is the impact of informal rationing, if you will, and the weak economy, those two impacts on the demand for power in Brazil. When we set up our assumptions in February, we stated we had no assumption of informal rationing and we had over 2% demand growth. And now what we're seeing is that the demand is actually slightly negative. Because thermals are dispatched first, all of that delta, all of that swing comes out of hydros. And of course, we're a hydro owner here. So that is the big difference that we did not have in the $0.12 downtick for International back in February. And we stated we didn't have any view on rationing in the numbers if rationing came about or lower demand, the results would be lower. So that is by far the bulk of the difference in International. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Steve, one thing I might just point out, Chile, the Chilean tax adjustment that was reflected in second quarter of 2014 is $0.07 of that $0.26 that was planned. We were aware of it. And the additional weakness is in Brazil and NMC [National Methanol Company], the oil prices have deteriorated slightly, but we saw a lot of that at the beginning of the year. And then all the conditions, we've talked about here on further weakening in Brazil is where the larger challenge has originated. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So when we think about beyond 2015 and if we made the jump that hydro might actually normalize. The issues outside of that are primarily related to the economy, I assume somewhat currency and are those two main issues? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: I think those are two main issues, Steve. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Any thoughts to reconsider strategic alternatives for the business? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Steve, that's a question we've spent a fair amount of time on as you imagine. We thought our process and I still believe our process last year was a good one, very thorough. We were looking at growth, we were looking at cash and we solved the cash, which we believe is important to supporting the dividend. We've already brought home, $1.2 billion of that $2.7 billion. There is no question we're operating in a challenging environment, and all of the factors we talked about today are something that the team in International is focused on. I am pleased with the way they've responded to these challenging conditions. And at this point, I don't have anything further to share on how we think about this business strategically, but we've certainly learned a lot about volatility in this business as a result of these recent events, and that'll factor into our planning in the future. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then one last question maybe at a high level. Between the balance sheet and position you have now, and things like the securitization coming in Florida some point soon, how much available cash or balance sheet capacity do you have for investment in growth opportunities, right now? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Well, we have a solid balance sheet and we have a number of growth opportunities, where our capital spend is typically in the neighborhood of $7 billion a year. So, there is... Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : I'm sorry. I want to make sure \u2013 I mean above kind of what you're planning to do right now? So, like if you had opportunities that go above the current investment plan? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: We do. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : And how much upside? Yeah. Okay. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: We haven't quantified that specifically. The one thing I would say, Steve, is if you look at the leverage in the business, the utilities are situated relative to their cap structure that they earn on, capacity sits at the holding company and we're probably at 27%, 28% of HoldCo debt. There's probably capacity at HoldCo, up to 30% or maybe a little bit above, depending on how the credit rating agencies look at that. So, can't quantify it any more specifically than that, but we're committed to our ratings. We think we have an incredibly strong balance sheet with flexibility, to address what we think the business requires. And we'll continue to manage that accordingly. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : And how much will you get from securitization? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: We will get about $1.3 billion from the securitization process. We're targeting the first quarter of 2016 to get those funds. About half of those funds will be used to displace Florida \u2013 Duke Energy Florida OpCo debt, the other half of the funds will come up to the parent. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Chris Turnure with JPMorgan. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Hello. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : You kind of mentioned in your prepared remarks, and then in response to an earlier question that, it's too early to tell what's going to happen potentially with GSF reform (49:07) in Brazil, and I can definitely appreciate that. But, do you have at least a sense as to what the EPS impact would be there, if we went from say a 20% now to a 10% or a 5% protection type level, just versus normal in any given full year? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: We don't have any sensitivities on that, Chris. There is a lot of variables here. Where is our contracted load? What is the PLD price? So there is just variables there that are too multiple for us to try to put a metric on. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: And I think... Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: ...as we get to a point of clarity on the way the courts and the way the regulation will change, we'll be in a position to give you a better sense of timing, what our contracted position is, where we're forecasting PLD. But it's premature to do that at this point, because there are too many moving parts. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Fair enough. And then, just kind of going back to the 2016 and beyond picture, it's still pretty early here to talk about any potential growth guidance changes. But I just wanted to address maybe balance sheet capacity, like we were talking about on the last question, or just your ability to do other things, outside of what you've already talked about, whether it's accelerating more repatriation of cash or doing other securitizations, outside of the Florida one that you already have in plans, or maybe pulling forward Carolina's rate cases earlier than the 2017 to 2018 timeframe that you're currently thinking about right now? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: In connection with our planning process, Chris, we'll look at every element of the business to ensure we're delivering as much value as we can. I think we've demonstrated an ability to identify investment projects that are beneficial to customers and also delivering returns to shareholders. We do have flexibility in the balance sheet for additional investment. So, we'll be evaluating all of those alternatives in connection with our business planning process. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. But at this time, nothing is seeming more likely than not, or nothing's standing out in your mind? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Yeah. Nothing that I would share at this point. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Just wanted... Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Michael. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: ...to revisit \u2013 hi, Lynn. Just wanted to revisit a few things on the Regulated side of the house. First of all, can you remind us, for the spend you do on coal ash in North Carolina, what the cost recovery process is; meaning, how do you actually \u2013 how, and more importantly when, do you actually get this in rates? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yes, Michael. There is no definitive plan for collection of the coal ash in rates. We spent about $100 million to-date on this, and that will ramp up over the next several years. And the way this will work, we'll start spending and acting on our plans in conjunction with CAMA over the next several years. And then, at some point, an appropriate point, we can go in for a rate case, and we can incorporate coal ash spend into that rate case. So we have flexibility there, there is no set timeframe for this. And you might look in time, and think about the next rate case, being associated with the completion of a large power plant, a combined cycle or completion of a lot of nuclear work in the Duke Energy Progress area. That might put you in the later part of the teens, for going in for a rate increase. At that point in time, we would probably request an increment in base rates for coal ash recovery. And the Commission would then begin to monitor coal ash cost recovered through rates versus coal ash spent and adjust it from there; this is not like a normal capital project, where you spend over in a short intense period and then are completed, the spend will go on for a long time. So I think it will have that type of nature of recovery to it. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: There is precedent in North Carolina for more real-time recovery of environmental cost, thinking back to like Clean Smokestacks from a number of years ago. Just curious, is there an opportunity, whether via regulation or via legislation \u2013 and I'm not sure which one it would require \u2013 to get more real-time recovery of coal ash spend, and more kind of the certainty of recovery over time? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Yeah, Michael. I'll take that one. I think North Carolina has demonstrated over a long period of time recovery of mandated cost and certainly coal ash, whether it's at a state level or Federal level, those are required costs of decommissioning the plants. I don't see in the next year or two, any change in the recovery mechanism that Steve just described and given the magnitude of the spend that we're talking about, I think that's reasonable. So, we'll be addressing it in connection with the general rate case and evaluating what else might make sense over time. I think about Clean Power Plan, I think about \u2013 we have trackers for renewables. There are a variety of events that could trigger consideration of other forms of recovery. But I don't see coal ash as being one that would \u2013 we would approach as a single item at this point. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. One last question on utility O&M. Did I hear correctly that what you're basically saying is, O&M levels in the second half of 2015 will be flat to second half 2014? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yes. That's correct, Michael. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: When you look at broader O&M, what are you \u2013 at the Regulated businesses and especially in the Carolinas \u2013 what do you see as potential \u2013 you're a couple of years out post-merger, but continued cost saving opportunities to where instead of flat, it's even potentially down? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Some of the cost savings opportunities that we are now pursuing are the rollout of work management systems. We've already done a lot the corporate work. We've rolled out work management systems in the fossil area. We've done a lot of nuclear work. But now we're rolling out into T&D and that's more dispersed in asset location and employee workforce. So, that's an area that is ripe for some benefits. So, we'll continue to roll these projects out and have some opportunities here to offset some of the cost increases that we face, such as cyber security, normal inflation, Fukushima and that kind of thing, but I do believe there are efficiency opportunities still out there. Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you, Steve, and much appreciated. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Jonathan. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Sorry to revisit this, but you've said a couple of times, you want to be clear about and transparent about what you're saying on growth. And I just on this \u2013 we've already talked about the footnote on the slide around long-term earnings growth. You also changed the word you're using from deliver to target. And I'd hate to read too much into that, but I just \u2013 Lynn, are we saying that if International kind of doesn't rebound post-2015 in a decent way that you may not be able to stay at the low end of the 4% to 6% or are we not saying that? I'm not feeling I heard the clarity. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Yeah. And you know, Jonathan, I'm not trying to reset guidance range at this point. But I am trying to flag for you that we see uncertainty in the International business that is difficult sitting here in early August of 2015 to predict duration and extent. And so, a rebound, if we see a rebound in 2017, that's certainly positive. But it's more challenging today than I would have said to you it was in January of this year and that's what we're trying to signal or trying to say. And we'll continue to update you as we see rainy season starting to develop and we see any potential changes in the regulatory scheme, the injunctions and other things, but it's more challenging based on what we see right now. Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. And again, apologies for the revisit. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: No. That's fine. Great. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: All right. Operator : Next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Thank you. Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hello. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Hi. Listen, with regards to the securitization proceeds, Steve, you said half of them will be used for OpCo debt reduction, half going to the parent. Any thoughts on how that other half gets used? The reason I ask is on the original settlement agreement you were going to be earning an ROE on it, granted it was a 30% reduction, but there was earnings coming from that and so is there a dilutive potential given securitization that may not have been part of the original plan. Is that a fair way to think about this? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: You're correct there. We are giving up the equity return that was baked into the Crystal River 3 recovery mechanism from the settlement in 2013, albeit it was a haircut return. Whether it's dilutive or not depends upon the redeployment of the proceeds here. And again we will be looking for growth opportunities to help replace that equity return loss. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : So at this point you would not assume that that is used for any HoldCo debt reduction. It probably goes into some rate base kind of investment? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Well, it will move into our general funds and help fund growth. Ideally we'd like to find an investment to put it right into, but certainly it will be utilized to reduce HoldCo debt that then helps fund other acquisitions, other purchases, other investments more efficiently. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: And Ali, what I would say to that, we haven't earmarked a specific investment for those funds, but there have been a lot of questions today about holding company capacity for additional investment, this would be part of that. And so our objective will be to deploy that in a way that maximizes the value. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Yeah. And Lynn, what's the latest on the Edwardsport investigation in Indiana? Is that still out there? I thought it should have been done by now. What's the latest? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: So there is a rate proceeding in front of the Indiana Commission, Ali, on the regulatory every six month rider mechanisms as well as the fuel clauses. And we would expect an order from the Commission before the end of the year, perhaps even as early as the third quarter. So, that does remain out there. In the slide deck we've given you kind of a chart of what the open proceedings are, I think it's on slide 21 just to give you a sense of where these are. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay. Yeah, I thought it was a summer timeframe, I guess it's a little later. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: I think it's a little later. Yeah. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay. And last question, the timeline for some of you investments, you've made that investment in the pipeline and you've got the other bigger pipeline out there. Are you thinking, Lynn, when you update your long-term growth rates perhaps next year, that you may stretch it out over a five-year period as opposed to the three-year periods that we've been doing currently, given that some of the stuff won't hit until later in the decade? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Ali, it's a good question, we debate the period internally. We had a longer term one, we moved it to three years, five years is a possibility. But I think the point you're making is a good one, which is infrastructure investment occurs over a longer period of time. So, we haven't made a final decision on that, but we are \u2013 we will evaluate it. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Great. Thanks so much. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Lynn Good for closing remarks. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thanks, everyone for being on the call, for your interest and investment in Duke Energy. We are scheduled for a third quarter call on November 5, and look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months. Thanks again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great rest of your day.",

At this time, all lines have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now pleasure to introduce your host Bill Currens, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir you may begin. Bill Currens : Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's third quarter 2015 earnings review and business update. Leading our call is Lynn Good, President and CEO, along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the Safe Harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on our Web site at duke-energy.com and in today's materials. Please note that the appendix to today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures to help you analyze the Company's performance. As summarized on Slide 3, Lynn will cover our third quarter highlights and provide summary of our recent strategic and growth initiatives. Then Steve will provide an overview of our third quarter financial results and an update on our economic activities within our service territories, as well as an overview of our earnings growth prospects as we move into 2016 in the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This morning reported third quarter 2015 adjusted EPS of $1.47 per share above the $1.40 per share in 2014, as favorable weather and growth in the regulating utilities supported our results. Our regulated businesses have performed well throughout 2015 delivering solid financial results. As we look to the fourth quarter, we are narrowing our guidance range to $4.55 to $4.65 per share. This range reflects mild October weather, as well as storm expenses, unfavorable foreign currency trends and the potential for extending bonus depreciation. The extension of bonus will modestly increase our effective tax for the year. Earlier this year, we increase the growth rate of the dividend to approximately 4%, reflecting our confidence in the strength of our core businesses. The growing dividend supports our commitment to deliver attractive long-term returns for shareholders. Our financial results are made possible by the efforts of our people who work every day to keep our plant safe, efficient and reliable, providing our customers with valuable services. Our regulated generation fleet continued to deliver for customers during the critical summer months. Our nuclear fleet achieved a 97% capacity factor during the quarter and our growing regulated gas fleet continued to deliver value for our customers, taking advantage of the low natural gas prices. In fact our utilities have burned more natural gas in the first nine months of 2015 than they did in either of the two prior full years. The Edwardsport IGCC plant continues to operate well, achieving a third quarter gasifier availability factor of around 80%, massing the first quarter\u2019s record. Additionally in July, the facility achieved a record month of net generation. In early October, we experienced heavy rains and flooding in the Carolinas and 500,000 customer outages. We were well prepared and mobilized our crudes in advance, speeding the restoration of service. Like others in the industry we are making progress towards a safe, cost effective closure of our Ash Basins in the Carolinas. Basin closure is underway at six sites and we are working through the approval of closure plans at our remaining basins. I\u2019m proud of the way the Duke team has responded to this important industry issue with excellence and leadership. We are systematically and strategically increasing our regulated business mix through a series of acquisitions and divestitures as highlighted on Slide 5. As well as the portfolio of investments I will discuss in a moment. Last week, we were very excited to announce the plan to acquire Piedmont Natural Gas, which will add a well established natural gas business and platforms in the Duke portfolio. From a strategic perspective, we see this acquisition as the foundation for establishing a broader gas infrastructure platform within Duke, building upon our recent gas pipeline investments and complementing our existing gas LBT business in the Midwest. We plan to leverage the scale Duke with Piedmont\u2019s well regarded management team and excellent operational capabilities. Piedmont has long been recognized as a premier operator of low risk regulated gas infrastructure. We have partnered with them over many years, as they have built and operated the critical gas infrastructure that serves natural gas generation in this region. Piedmont is experiencing robust customer growth and is investing in projects that have constructive regulatory mechanisms providing a strong base to organic growth. These investments are expected to grow their rate base, by an average of around 9% over the coming years. This acquisition is expected to close by the end of 2016 and be accretive to our earnings in the first full year after close. This will increase our total regulated business mix to over 90%, firmly supporting our earnings and dividend growth objectives. We will keep you updated, as we progress through the approval process. Turning to Slide 6. We are also focused on creating long-term growth and value for our customers and shareholders, with investments that will modernize our system, both our generation and our growth for the benefit of our customers. We continue to introduce more diversity to our fleet through low cost natural gas. Construction has begun on a combined cycle natural gas plant at the lease site in South Carolina, while preconstruction activities will commence on the Citrus County combined-cycle plant later this year. Both projects represent a total of over 2 billion in investments and remain on-time and on-budget. Our Western Carolina modernization project also remains on track. You may recall that we decided to retire our coal unit in Asheville and replaced it with a combined-cycle gas plant and a new transmission line, to improve reliability and support growth in the Asheville area. After working through a comprehensive stakeholder engagement process over the course for the summer, we announced yesterday a modified set of resources to support this project, eliminating the need for a new transmission line. Rather than the 650 megawatt gas plant, we will build two 280 megawatt combined-cycle natural gas units with the option for 190 megawatt simple cycle unit by 2023. A total estimated investment of just over $1 billion. This modification allows us to maintain our 2024 retirement schedule, while reflecting important input from our customers and communities. Further, earlier this year we acquired the NCEMPA asset, a project that is a win-win for our customers in the Eastern region of North Carolina. Our two gas pipeline infrastructure project Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Sabal Trail will provide critical access to additional low cost natural gas in the Southeast, helping to meet growing demand for the fuel from our generation portfolio, as well as to serve our customers\u2019 needs. These projects continue to move through the regulatory approval and siting processes. The formal FERC application for ACT was filed in September and we expect FERC approval in 2016. Once FERC approval is obtained, the project can begin construction activities with an expected COD in late 2018. At Sabal Trial FERC approval is expected in early 2015 with the pipeline operational in 2017. In Indiana, we are revising our grid modernization plan under state legislation and we plan to re-file our plan by the end of this year. We\u2019re also making meaningful progress growing our renewable investments both in our regulated footprint and in the commercial business. On the regulated side, we\u2019re on track to complete construction of 128 megawatts of utility scaled solar in North Carolina by the end of this year and our moving forward with investments in both South Carolina and Florida. Our commercial renewables portfolio also continues to grow with demand for wind and solar projects throughout the U.S. is supported by renewable portfolio standards and growing customer demand. We have a number of commercial wind and solar projects slated to come online later this year, which will increase this portfolio to over 2,700 megawatts of capacity. Overall, these growth investments total $20 billion through 2019 and provide the foundation for growth in the coming years. Steve will provide additional perspective on 2016 and beyond in his remarks. In conclusion, we continue to execute very well, providing safe, reliable and affordable power to our customers. Our growth prospects remain strong as we deploy significant capital and critical energy infrastructure investments. This establishes the foundation to provide clean modern energy to our customers and our communities for decades to come. Let me turn it over to Steve. Steve Young : Thanks Lynn. Today, I\u2019ll review our third quarter financial results and provide a brief look into 2016. I would also discuss the economic drivers in our regulated service territories and the low growth experienced in the third quarter. I\u2019ll ramp up with the discussion of our financial objectives. Let\u2019s start with the quarterly results as highlighted on Slide 7. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year, please refer to the supporting materials that accompanied today\u2019s press release. We achieved third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.47, compared to $1.40 in last year\u2019s third quarter. On a reported basis, 2015 third quarter earnings per share were $1.35, compared to $1.80 last year. As a reminder last year\u2019s third quarter results included a $0.43 favorable adjustment for a change in the estimated value of the Mid-West generation business. A reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results is included in the supplemental materials to today\u2019s presentation. Regulated utilities quarterly adjusted results increased by $0.07 per share, driven largely by warmer weather and strong margins in our wholesale business, including the new NCEMPA contract. As we expected, these positive drivers were partially offset by higher O&M related to the timing of outages, increased cost related to NCEMPA and higher storm costs. International\u2019s quarterly earnings declined $0.02 over last year. Continued weakness in foreign exchange rates in Brazil and lower margins at National Methanol were partially offset by lower purchase power costs in Brazil. Additionally, we recognized an asset impairment in Ecuador during the quarter. Our commercial portfolio incurred $0.08 of lower adjusted earnings as a result of the absence of prior year Mid-West generation results due to lower wind resources this year earnings from our commercial renewable business are expected to be around 75 million for the full year versus our original expectation of 100 million. Commercial\u2019s results will be favorable impacted in the fourth quarter by tax credits related to over 300 megawatts of wind in solar generation scheduled to come online. And finally other was up $0.06 due to favorable tax adjustments in the timing of tax levelization as a reminder due to income tax levelization other reflects projected benefits related to renewable tax credits ratably during the year. Once the projects become operational these benefits are reallocated to the commercial portfolio. Lastly our quarterly results benefited $0.04 from the accelerated stock repurchase completed earlier in the year. Moving on to Slide 8, I\u2019ll now discuss our retail customer volume trends. Across our jurisdictions weather-normalized retail load growth has increased by 0.3%, over the rolling 12 months. Within the residential sector we are seeing some positive trends. We continue to add new customers at an annual rate of approximately 1.3%. And we\u2019ve now experienced two consecutive quarters of relatively flat usage per customer. We also continue to see favorable key indicators for the residential sector including employment, personal incomes and spending, as well as household formations. The commercial sector continues to grow modestly benefiting from declining office vacancy rates and expansion in the restaurant and real estate sub-sectors. This growth was partially offset by lower governmental and retail store sales during the quarter. The industrial sector while strong for most of the year has recently slowed, we are continuing to see transportation and building materials gain momentum. In particular, residential construction activities remain strong in the Southeast. During the quarter, we began to experience some weakness in the metals and chemicals subsectors. This slowdown is due to a pause in industrial activity, driven by a deceleration of consumer, business and government spending, a reduction in inventories and the strong dollar which has reduced global demand for U.S. products. Our economic development teams remain active successfully helping to track new business investments into our service territories. So far this year these activities have led to the announcement of $2.4 billion in capital investments, which is expected to result in nearly 7,200 new jobs across our six states. With rolling 12 month weather-normalized load growth of 0.3% we expect to thin towards the low-end of our original 2015 expectation of 0.5% to 1%. Moving to Slide 9, let me layout our key earnings drivers, as we begin thinking about 2016. As has been our normal practice we will provide our 2016 guidance range and updated financial plans in February. For our regulated businesses, we plan for normal weather. We expect growth from rider recovery and AFUDC on major capital investments, along with a full year impact of the NCEMPA transaction and modest growth in retail load. With respect to our cost structure, we continue to build upon the success of our recent merger integration activities. Cost management is an ongoing effort. And we are finding ways to reduce O&M below current levels to match modest sales growth. We expect growth in the commercial portfolio, as we continue to add contracted renewable generation and expect the return of normal wind patterns. The loss of Midwest generation\u2019s earnings contribution is a headwind but it is partially offset by the accelerated soft repurchase. We expect internationals\u2019 earnings have stabilized in 2015 and have the opportunity for modest growth in 2016, largely driven by an expectation for improved high growth dispatch, over the past several months we begun to see higher water inflows and lower market power crises. Further, meteorologists are forecasting a strong Alminio weather pattern through early 2016, which could lead to increased rainfall in Southeastern Brazil. Currency exchange rates are expected to remain volatile but the inflationary provisions in our contracts in Brazil can help to mitigate some of the currency devaluation. We also expect Brent crude oil prices will stabilize in 2016. Now moving to Slide 10, I want to step back and discuss our overall earnings growth objectives. Since 2013, our regulated and commercial segments representing 90% of Duke Energy have delivered 5% earnings growth. As we look at 2016 and beyond. These segments are expected to continue to grow within our 4% to 6% growth objective as we deploy significant capital and critical gas and electric infrastructure investments, including the acquisition of Piedmont, as well as renewable investments in our commercial business. We will also see the potential for rate cases in the Carolinas in the coming years to provide timely cash recovery of these important investments. The remaining portion of the company, the international business has experienced a decline, contributing earnings of $0.67 per share in 2013 and 2014 to about half that in 2015. About half of this decline is due to the three year drought in Brazil while unfavorable exchange rates and lower crude oil prices comprise the remaining half. From this point forward we will believe that internationals\u2019 earnings have stabilized and are positioned for modest growth, consistent with our past practice, we will provide more specific financial guidance in February. We plan to reset our base to 4% to 6% long-term earnings growth off of 2016. This reflects continued strong growth in our core businesses, as well as a more realistic based year for growth in our international business from 2016 forward. Moving on Slide 11 outlines our financial objectives for 2015 and beyond. For the reasons Lynn mentioned earlier, we are narrowing our guidance range for 2015, from $4.55 to $4.75 per share to $4.55 to $4.65 per share. We have made significant progress in advancing our strategic growth initiatives, both in our regulated and commercial businesses providing strong support for our long-term earnings growth objective. Our objective is to grow the dividend annually at a rate consistent with our long-term\u2019s earnings growth objectives. In near-term, our payout ratio will trend slightly above 70%. We are comfortable with that higher range based on the strong growth in our core regulated and commercial businesses. And the cash flows we are repatriating from international. Our strong investment grade credit ratings are important to us, as they help us finance our growth in an efficient manner. I am pleased with our results for 2015. We have successfully executed on a number of key strategic initiatives and delivered strong financial and operating results. Helping to offset the weakness in international, we remain focused on finishing the year well. With that, let\u2019s open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Shar Pourreza : So this morning, you reiterated your 4% to 6% growth, but also higher yet to be determined 2016 base year and you did drop that footnote you had in the second quarter around DEI potentially being a swing factor in your outlook. Steve is this sort of like what you meant when you mentioned that Piedmont deal would enhance growth trajectory is it less concerns around DEI or sort of what\u2019s driving this increased confidence? Steve Young : Well, I think what I would refer you to Shar is the slide we discussed 10. Where we looked at our core businesses, when you isolate international with our core businesses they have grown consistently at 5% from 2013 through \u201915 and we would expect that to continue. The international business has involved which moved from a $0.60 per year business to $0.30. And that\u2019s been the challenge we\u2019ve had to deal with in 2015, that\u2019s difficult to overcome. So we billion rebasing in \u201916 makes sense in light of what international has done. Shar Pourreza : And it included Piedmont right? Lynn Good : We expect to close Piedmont Shar towards the end of \u201916 into \u201917, you may recall from our announcement a week ago that we laid out a calendar. We will work as aggressively as we can to close it but I think a year is a good planning assumption. Shar Pourreza : Okay, got it. And then just one last question on international, it\u2019s good to see the currencies becoming a little bit less of an issue the hydrology is improving. We haven\u2019t heard much on this lately. Is there any sort of incremental datapoints around the Brazilian government potentially looking at providing some sort of a retrieve to the hydro generators or is this sort of a kind of a dead movement? Steve Young : There has been a lot of activity in this area Shar, recently there was a technical note that was issued by an arm of the government and that\u2019s really just a document that summarizes discussions to-date, a number of discussions are occurring. The government is targeting issuing effectively an executive order this calendar it remains uncertain exactly when, but that\u2019s their target. And what that order might say is not certain at this point either. So there is more work to be done here. I would say that in general the views of people and the government and the regulators have been constructive with regard to generators in our position. So there is more to come there in the meantime, the injunctions are still in effect and that has provided some relief to us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse. Dan Eggers : Hi just taking up on the Slide 11, when you guys, you made the comment about the dividend trending higher than target payout ratio, but also you are wanting to keep with the long-term EPS growth rate. Can you just maybe translate what you\u2019re trying to signal in those comments which seem to be a little bit in conflict? Lynn Good : Dan, I would go back to the Steve\u2019s comments on Slide 10 with the intent to rebase off of 2016 and move to 4% to 6% from that point forward. We see the dividend trending slightly above 70% in the very near-term. And so if I look at the strength of the dividend, the dividend is really driven by the underlying core business, which is growing quite well and given the investments we have put in place, we believe that it will continue. And so we have confidence in growing it at that rate and allowing payout ratio trend out modestly in the short-term we think it\u2019s a smart decision. Dan Eggers : Okay. And then on O&Ms you guys have done a good job as far as bringing down costs since the Progress acquisition. What kind of reductions do you see from here as you are a part of that \u201916 drivers the idea of bringing cost out, is it a substantial reduction \u201916 versus \u201915 or is more just absorbing inflation at this point? Lynn Good : We are still at work Dan on our plans and we\u2019re targeting to absorb inflation plus and we think that's going to be a combination of a number of things that we build a strong foundation on but we are going after productivity and efficiency and the company as you said has demonstrated a great ability to control cost and we see even more potential in to \u201916. Dan Eggers : Okay. And then I guess maybe the last one just on you kind of just calibrated the commercial business and not to get too far ahead on \u201916 but commercial is now coming in below where you guys thought the normal baseline would be, do you still feel comfortable with $100 million as your run rate from residual commercial? Lynn Good : This year we\u2019ve been impacted by wind resources Dan and I think that's a theme that you have seen with others that have significant renewable exposure. So we expect our restoration of that to more normal levels as part of our planning for \u201916 and then we do intend to continue to deploy capital in a way that meets our return expectations, so we would expect to see some growth. I think over the long-term the cash spreads and other things will have to be evaluated, but we see ongoing momentum around renewables. Steve Young : And we have committed projects for 2016 lined up as well to keep the growth going there and also in our commercial portfolio as you move forward we will start to see earnings from our pipeline investments kick in as well. Dan Eggers : Okay. So just one last one on the load growth trends, you may have had a -- you are below, at the bottom end or a little bit below where you thought you\u2019d be even the customer growth seemed pretty good this year, are you having to reconsider kind of what that long-term growth rate is, is it 0% to 0.5% or do you think there is some discrete usage trends maybe around multi-family housing or something like that that is explaining why usage has been that much of a drag relative to customer growth? Lynn Good : Dan, I think we\u2019ve been working with a 0.5% to 1% for some time and I think a 0.5% seems to be the range that we\u2019re in. And I think it\u2019s all the things you talked about it is synergy efficiency, it is housing patterns and even volatility in industrial. We had strong industrial growth when you dial back in this quarter. So what we are focused on as we kind of link this discussion to our cost structure, is planning to cost structure that can absorb that variability and also be positioned for modest very low load growth if that's the direction things continue to head. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Jonathan Arnold : I just would like to understand a little better when you are talking about this rebase on 2016 and Steve, I\u2019m not quite sure whether I have you right, are you saying you anticipate growing at the 4% to 6% through 2016 and then also off of 2016 or implicit within this concept to the rebase seems to be the idea that maybe you weren\u2019t or you want to reposition the range a little bit, I just want to understand what you are saying on \u201916, when you made that statement? Steve Young : What we are looking at Jonathan is we will set a base year or anchor year off of 2016 and then you would see 4% to 6% growth from there. And we think we\u2019ve got to do that given the changes in international we think it\u2019s stabilized and it\u2019s moved from again a $0.60 business to a $0.30ish business going forward. So where we base with \u201916 as the anchor we see a 4% to 6% growth there, underlined by the strong core business growth in the track history that it shows and some potential modest growth in international from that new lower level. Lynn Good : And so what I would add to that Jonathan, if you could look at the Slide 10, you see the regulated and commercial portfolio, the blue bar that's the bar that's growing at 4% to 6% and then you have an international business, which is about $0.30 in \u201915 so it would add to that and grow modestly. So that's the direction that we are trying to provide here with expectations for \u201916 and then we think from that base, we are in a position to grow at 4% to 6% going forward. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. Understood. Thank you. Could you maybe just -- do you have an expectation currently on what -- how pension will look as a driver for next year just specifically or is it a little early to tell? Steve Young : It's a little early to tell on pension you got to take a look at the discount rate right at year-end, and who knows where that will go, if the Fed raises rates or something that could have an impact on it, I don't think it would be any huge change that we\u2019re looking at in pension expense, at this point but again with it being so sensitive to the discount rate, we would -- it's a little early to say precisely. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman : So a couple of questions, I just, these international pressures are not new and in the past you talked about trying to work on a plan and things to offset the international pressures. It just sounds to me like, it just not -- you just kind of changed to, they just are what they are, we\u2019re just resetting the base and then growing off there, because these are just -- became too much. Is that fair to say what happened? Lynn Good : Steve I would say slightly differently. And in 2015, I think the team has done an extraordinary job of offsetting. What is happened in international, we started the year with an expectation, they would deliver 345 and they\u2019re delivering just north of 200 million. And that\u2019s an execution on strategic initiatives more timely and that\u2019s been running the business slow and taking advantage of good weather and other things that have developed. As we look forward, we did not have an expectation earlier in the year of weather international with rebound, the depth of the currency issues, were difficult to forecast at that time, the economic implications. And so as we sit here, closing the year we see a rebound on water conditions in hydrology, but we continue to see headwinds on currency and economic growth. And so we think it\u2019s appropriate in light of what we see today to establish a baseline of about $0.30 for \u201915 on international. And then we do believe it\u2019s stabilized and we see an opportunity for modest growth from there. I think what is important is that the 90% of the business regulated in core has demonstrated strong growth over the period of \u201913 to \u201915 and we think that will keep going. As a result of all the investments we have put in place and our ability to execute. Steve Fleishman : And the updated guidance for the international you are now -- are you using kind of current forwards for currency in oil and the like or? Lynn Good : Yes. Steve Young : Yes. Steve Fleishman : And essentially are you -- okay, great. And then just thinking about Piedmont and the context for the 4% to 6% of this 2016 base now just would that -- you talked on the deal announcement of that enhancing the 4% to 6% so if there was no Piedmont, would you still be 4% to 6% or not. Could you just kind of clarify now that you have this new base? Lynn Good : Yes. So the growth rate is not dependent on Piedmont. We believe the base business itself, the investments that we\u2019ve outlined, the way the business is executing is capable of growing 4 to 6. So we see Piedmont as incremental to the growth rate. And\u2026 Steve Fleishman : But still in the 4 to 6? Lynn Good : Yes. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then just on the dividend growth and earnings growth comment. Because you\u2019re saying, we\u2019re going to grow the dividend in line with earnings but then we\u2019re above the payout ratio. So kind of by definition you just switch to end up saying about the payout ratio. If that is what you actually do? So could you just kind of clarify your communication there? Steve Young : Our dividend is growing about 4% now. I believe that we\u2019ll move above the 70% target level for a while. But as we grow we believe we\u2019ll return back to our target level. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs & Company. Michael Lapides : Real quick question, just when you think about the renewable business. You have had the earnings benefit in the last year or so. Can you quantify and Steve you touched on it, I want to make sure I understand it. Can you quantify the total EPS benefit of the tax credits? And then how you think about replacing that if solar development slows post 2016 and tax credit roll off or PTCs don\u2019t actually get extended? Steve Young : Michael right now, a lot of the net income bottom-line benefit from the renewables, the commercial renewables business comes from the tax benefits. There is some profitability on the non-tax side in the ongoing margin, but the bulk of the earnings comes from the tax benefits. So your question is when these tax benefits when and if they expire what happens there. I think based on what we have seen and heard now there will still be a market for renewable power as no states are backing off RPF standards and that\u2019s a basis for a lot of the growth here is responding to RFPs to meet these requirements. The PPAs in the contracts may have to change with the absence of the tax benefits. And the pricing may have to change, but we will still structure this business to provide profitability here. I would also add that the cost for the renewables is going down and will help offset some of the tax benefits that exists. Michael Lapides : Got it. And just how much were for those tax benefits as part of your 2015 guidance. Is that the full piece of commercial that $75 million or just some portion of it? Steve Young : It\u2019s the majority of the 75 million. Michael Lapides : Got it, okay. The other thing can the O&M cost savings offset the $0.17 impact of positive weather this year? Lynn Good : Michael, we are not getting that specific on how each of these drivers impact, so what I would direct you to is think about our O&M spend and we are at work to not only offset inflationary impact to drive those costs lower in \u201916. So I think about weather and we always start by planning normal weather and then we\u2019re building up with investment earnings as well as cost control. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Chen of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Bryan Chen : Hi my questions have been answered guys. Operator : Our next question is coming from Jim Von Riesemann of Mizuho Securities. Jim Von Riesemann : I got to put my dead head on for a second here. Can you just a talk little bit about how much cash flow is upstream from the regulated utilities to the parent level every year on an annualized basis? Lynn Good : I think we will probably take that question offline. Jim, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve got a cash flow statement sitting in front of us here. Steve Young : Right, I don't have that with me, we\u2019ll have to work on that a bit Jim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ali Agha. Ali Agha : Lynn and Steve just listening to your comments, just so that I\u2019m clear, with normalized weather next year international being modest, some cost savings and then the rebasing, just directionally it appears that \u201916 it is pretty much flat to maybe modestly down from \u201915 and then so is that fair? Lynn Good : I think we\u2019ve given you the drivers, if you look at the slide, on Slide 10 to grow the base business at 4% to 6% add to it international with modest growth and so I think we\u2019ve given you a pretty good sense of where we think it will be and of course we\u2019ll give you more detail in February, as we finalize our business plans so that you can understand more specifically how much of it is coming from O&M and how much is coming from each of the business segments. Ali Agha : Okay. And more near-term in 2015, when you locked of $0.10 from the higher end of the range, is that all because of commercial, is it international being worse, can you just kind of elaborate the change in \u201915 guidance? Lynn Good : So Ali, we have really been working throughout \u201915 to offset weakness in international and have been successful in doing that through a variety of things including favorable weather, as well as early closings on the Eastern Power Agency and the stock buyback. As we look to the fourth quarter though we always plan for normal weather, we started out with October being mild, we have storm expense sitting in October, we have a slighter, weaker currency as a result of some of the movements that occurred in September and then we also talked about the extension of bonus depreciation. We don't know for sure, but it feels to us like that will likely get extended and if it does, because of our cash position, it results in a modestly higher effective tax rate for the company. So all of those things considered, we think $4.55 to $4.65 is an appropriate range at this point. Ali Agha : Steve and on the bonus depreciation front Lynn, I mean the talk is that if it gets extended, it\u2019s a two year extension, I\u2019m just curious of that's how you guys are seeing it and if so can you just quantify, just a bonus depreciation and extension impact for Duke? Steve Young : We\u2019ve heard various guesses that how long it will be extended, we think there is a good likelihood of at least one year, two years is possible as well, and the impacts for 2015, for one year extension is in the range of $0.04 for us if you go beyond into a two year extension, it could be a similar number just depends on our overall tax positioning the issue for us is we\u2019re toggling in and out of an NOL position and which makes us perhaps unique in the industry, if you are deeply within an NOL or outside of an NOL position. This extension doesn\u2019t have an impact and it depends a bit on when we come out of that NOL position, which depends on other factors. So it's a little hard to predict beyond \u201915. Lynn Good : And of course all the cash flow. Cash flow is positively impacted, if it is extended, so let see if this is giving you as earnings for certain. Ali Agha : Absolutely. Last question Lynn, so on the international operations is the mind set now look, sort of hunker down and sort of work with the portfolio flat to modest growth, is that sort of the planning now and not really being more proactive and saying, hey does this really fit in the portfolio? Lynn Good : Our focus has certainly been this year, Ali trying to run the business as efficiently as we can, we focused on cost, I think the international team has done an extraordinary job in a difficult market, we think it stabilized and hopefully, we\u2019ll see a slightly better picture in \u201916. I think the portfolio is always under review. The fact that we added Piedmont is consistent with our view that we wanted more natural gas in the portfolio. So that\u2019s an ongoing review, in the meantime we\u2019re also taking advantage of the international cash as you know. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is comes from Paul Ridzon of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Paul Ridzon : In your release you indicate that for the quarter weather was a $0.09 pick-up at the utility and then when I look at Slide 19 in the deck. I see that last year it was $0.06 below norm, but this year is basically short of normal. Just trying to reconcile that? Steve Young : Yes. I think that your statements are correct there is some rounding in some of these schedules I believe is the difference in your sense. But we\u2019ve returned to normal weather this quarter last year, it was mild weather. Lynn Good : And Paul the other thing I would know the share count is going to have a difference between \u201914 and \u201915, because of the share buyback. Paul Ridzon : Okay. And then kind of given the pending Piedmont acquisition, what\u2019s going to happen to proceeds from securitization, should that just sit on the balance sheet when you use that cash when you close the deal? Lynn Good : Yes. So we would expect securitization to move through the process in \u201916 Paul. So we don\u2019t come into the cash flow as a company and be used for investments or 4 billion debt in the short-term. But we do see at as the cash flow item that over a long-term basis could be used for long-term investments Piedmont being one of them. Paul Ridzon : When do you expect that cash? Steve Young : We would expect to be able to close the securitization in the first to second quarter of 2016. Paul Ridzon : And then just lastly your latest thoughts around filing rate cases in your regulatory jurisdictions? Steve Young : We\u2019re looking at filing in I would say in the late teens it depends upon investment plans and other factors there that we\u2019d look at jurisdiction by jurisdiction. But generally we\u2019re looking at rate cases in the Carolinas in the late teens. Paul Ridzon : And then lastly just a clarification on the payout ratio discussion, if you were to look at your \u201915 payout ratio what would you use as the numerator and denominator. I guess 460 would be denominator? Steve Young : I\u2019m sorry, ask that again, I\u2019m sorry I am not. [Multiple Speakers] Paul Ridzon : I just want to make sure, how are you thinking about the payout ratio? What -- is it the indicated dividend at year-end or is it the dividend paid during the year? Steve Young : It\u2019s the dividend paid during the year as it grows over the annual earnings. Paul Ridzon : So it\u2019s kind of a mix a blend of two years of dividends, because change at mid-year? Lynn Good : So there is nothing fancy about this Paul. Whether you use an annualized number or whether you use what is paid out I think it\u2019s all a matter of small rounding. I would calculate the payout ratio the way you typically do for every other utility. Operator : Thank you. There appear to be no further questions in the queue at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Lynn Good for any closing or final remarks. Lynn Good : So thank you everyone for joining us today for your interest and investment in Duke Energy. Our fourth quarter earnings call which will also include our updated financial forecast will be held in February and we look forward to seeing many of you in the coming months and at the EEI Conference next week. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Duke Energy we\u2019d like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

Operator : Please standby, we're about to begin. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Duke Energy Year-End 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Bill Currens. Please go ahead. Bill Currens - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, April. Good morning everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings review and business update. Leading our call is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide two presents the Safe Harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today's materials. Please note that the appendix to today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. Before turning the call over to Lynn, I would like to give you an update on staffing for the Duke Energy IR team. After over two years with the team, Charlie Tapp will be shortly assuming new responsibilities within the Duke Energy organization. Therefore, this will be his last earnings call. I am very excited for Charlie, as this is a fantastic career move for him. Many of you have work closely with him over the past few years, and I hope you will join me in congratulating him on this fantastic move. With that, I will turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Today, we reported 2015 adjusted earnings of $4.54 per share in line with the year ago. I'm pleased with the solid performance and operational execution of our core regulated businesses despite record mild December weather. These results largely offset challenges throughout the year in our International operation. As a sign of confidence in the future, our board, last year, doubled the growth rate of the dividend, a key component of our investor value proposition. During today's call, we have several objectives. First, I will highlight how we are strategically positioning the business portfolio and investing for the long term. Then I will discuss our 2015 operational highlights, including our industry-leading safety and environmental performance. Steve will provide a financial update, with our outlook for 2016 and beyond. Turning to slide four, I'll begin with a broader discussion of our strategy, which provides an important context for the five-year financial plan that Steve will cover. Our industry is undergoing transformation with new technology, evolving customer expectations, increasingly impactful public policies and abundant low-cost natural gas. These factors will have a profound impact on our business in the years ahead and are enforming our strategic investments. We are focusing our long-term strategy on our core domestic, regulated businesses and our highly-contracted Renewables portfolio. We will invest an increasing amount in the electric grid, to strengthen reliability and resilience and enable new customer solutions. To advance reliable, cost-effective power and a lower-carbon future, we will invest in natural gas generation and infrastructure, as well as build on our rapid expansion and renewable technologies. We will also invest to maintain our valuable nuclear and clean coal assets. We enter this period of industry transformation with a strong regulated business, and we've demonstrated strength and operational excellence, sustainable cost management and regulatory execution. These capabilities will continue to underpin our success in the years ahead. An important part of this strategic focus is our decision outlined on slide five to engage advisors and pursue and an orderly exit of our Latin American generation business. This business has been an important part of the Duke Energy portfolio over many years, providing both earnings and cash flows. However, the returns over the last two years are inconsistent with our commitment to investors to provide predictable, stable earnings and cash flows. We believe there will be demand for this international portfolio at a reasonable valuation. Because we are early in the process, it is premature to establish a specific timeline for a potential transaction. The proceeds will be used to strengthen our balance sheet and help fund the growth in our core businesses. We expect that a sale will be dilutive. Nonetheless, the strategic exit significantly improves our risk profile and enhances our ability to generate more consistent earnings and cash flows over time. On slide six, I will update on our pending acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas. This investment is also an important element of our focus on natural gas infrastructure and customer solutions. Piedmont is a regulated natural gas infrastructure and local distribution company in the Carolinas and Tennessee. It operates gas infrastructure that supports our gas-fired generation in the Carolinas and provides valuable natural gas solutions to customers. We are obtaining a high-quality asset with an excellent management team, exceptional customer service and strong rate base growth prospects. Piedmont's highly-regulated gas businesses and constructive regulatory jurisdictions fit well with our strategic direction. We expect that the transaction will be accretive in 2017 with the level of accretion growing over time through incremental capital investments and integration of Piedmont operations. We've made good progress in obtaining the required approval. The Federal Trade Commission has graded early termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period, and Piedmont shareholders have approved the transaction. We are awaiting approvals from the North Carolina and Tennessee Utilities Commission. We are still targeting to close the transaction by the end of this year, and in the meantime, merger integration efforts are well underway, so that we are ready to hit the ground running immediately after the close. As outlined on slide seven, you can see the series of strategic transactions that we have made since 2012 to realign our business portfolio to drive more stable earnings and cash flows. The exit in International and acquisition of Piedmont will complete the transition. This repositioning provides an outstanding foundation for growth and investment for the remainder of this decade and beyond. Before I turn the call over to Steve, let me highlight on slide eight several important operational achievements in our progress, advancing our strategic investments during 2015. I'm proud of the 28,000 Duke Energy employees who are here day in and day out for our customers. Our customers count on us to provide safe, reliable, environmentally responsible energy every day. We completed 2015 with an industry-leading safety record, significantly reducing OSHA recordable incidents and our total incident case rate. Our work is never complete on this front, but I'm pleased with the focus and alignment throughout the organization on safe, event-free operations. We also significantly reduced the number of reportable environmental events in 2015. We have taken what we've learned from the Dan River spill in early 2014 and applied it throughout our organization to strengthen operational discipline and results. We have also built world-class capabilities to accelerate the safe closure of our ash basins and are on track to continue advancing the support and work in 2016. Likewise, our Edwardsport IGCC facility in Indiana continues to improve its operational performance, delivering the third consecutive year of improved output and gas supplier availability. We also made great progress on a number of our strategic growth initiatives during the year. As mentioned and consistent with our strategy, we are modernizing the electric grid and modernizing the generation portfolio, including investing in natural gas and utility-scale solar. During 2015, we completed the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency asset acquisition, which strengthens our generation portfolio in the Carolinas. We also announced plans for the Western Carolinas modernization project, which adds new natural gas and solar generation. We made updated filings for grid modernization in Indiana and continue to advance utility-scale solar investments in the Carolinas and Florida. In our Commercial Portfolio, we continue to grow our Renewables business throughout the U.S. In fact, we installed around 600 megawatts of new wind and solar assets in 2015, surpassing our original objective. Our natural gas pipeline investments will supply our customers with low-cost fuel and provide supply diversity, while delivering great returns for investors. The Sabal Trail pipeline received FERC approval earlier this month, while the Atlantic Coast Pipeline made its formal FERC filing late last year. In closing, strategic investments that provide value to customers underpinned by excellent operations will deliver stable and predictable growth in earnings and dividends for our shareholders for years to come. Now, let me turn the call over to Steve. Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks, Lynn. Today, my comments will focus briefly on 2015, and I will spend the majority of the discussion on 2016 guidance and our long-term growth prospects in our core businesses. We have extended our long-term earnings growth objective from three years to five years through 2020 to better align with our capital forecast or expected rate case activities and the completion of our portfolio transition. I'll begin on slide nine. In 2015, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings of $4.54 per share, slightly below our full year guidance range. Our fourth quarter results were impacted by very mild weather. In fact, weather in the month of December impacted our results by $0.12 as temperatures in the Carolinas averaged around 10 degrees above normal. For the full year, strength in our core businesses, our regulated utilities and our Commercial Portfolio of renewables and gas infrastructure, as well as early execution on a number of strategic initiatives, helped us offset weakness in our International business. Our core businesses delivered $4.15 per share on a weather-normal basis, representing an average annual 5.5% growth rate from our base year of 2013. And our International business delivered $0.33 per share. For more detailed information on our financial performance in 2015, please refer to the supporting materials that accompanied today's press release. Our 2016 adjusted earnings guidance range, which we are introducing today is $4.50 to $4.70 per share. The midpoint of this range assumes a contribution of $4.30 per share from the core businesses, which represent 4% growth over 2015. The midpoint also assumes $0.30 from International, which is down slightly from 2015. Let me walk you through the key drivers in our businesses from 2015 to 2016. Within the regulated utilities year-over-year weather-normal growth will be primarily driven by the deployment of almost $5 billion in growth capital. Retail load growth of 0.5%, the full year impact of our recent acquisition of the NCEMPA assets, as well as lower O&M costs. Lower O&M reflects our confidence in continuing to drive cost out of our business. I will review this further in a moment. Within our Commercial Portfolio, we plan to invest $1.5 billion in Renewables, and our pipeline joint ventures. Additionally, we realized a full year of benefit from the prior-year accelerated stock repurchase. These growth drivers are partially offset by regulatory lag in certain jurisdictions, as we will not have any significant base rate increases in 2016. The loss of earnings from the Midwest generation business, which was sold in 2015, will also be a partial offset. At International, we expect 2016 earnings of $0.30 per share. In Brazil reservoir levels have improved during the rainy season, which runs through April. As a result, we are assuming a return to normal dispatch of the hydro generation in Brazil after the rainy season, lowering our purchase power costs. This improvement in the Brazilian hydro operations is expected to be offset by the declining Brazilian exchange rates and low Brent crude oil prices, which impact National Methanol's level of profitability. Let's shift to discuss the components of our long-term growth. With the pending exit of International, we believe the appropriate focus for our long-term growth discussion should be centered around our core businesses. Through 2020, our core businesses are well-situated to grow within 4% to 6% off of their 2016 base of $4.30 per share. On slide 10, we have developed a base plan that will deliver 4% to 5% growth. We have also defined incremental growth opportunities that, if achieved, will deliver toward the higher end of the range, or 5% to 6% growth. Our base plan is largely driven by the deployment of between $22 billion and $25 billion of growth capital in our regulated utilities and between $3 billion to $5 billion in commercial renewables in our gas pipeline investments. This base plan also assumes weather-normalized retail load growth of 0.5% per year from 2016 to 2020, consistent with the past several years. As a reminder, every 50 basis point improvement in retail load growth provides about 1% earnings per share growth. In order to accommodate modest organic retail sales growth, we are targeting flat O&M cost through 2020. And, as you know, our track record in cost management has been very good. To achieve the high end of our long-term growth rate, or 5% to 6%, there are incremental growth opportunities that provide upside potential. They include retail load growth higher than our base plan assumption of 0.5%, supported by strengthening economic conditions in our service territories. More on that in a moment. The acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas, which is expected to be accretive to earnings per share, is additive to our growth rate as we move forward. Other growth opportunities exist in our wholesale business, in the form of new contracts. In addition, we also have opportunities to deploy more discretionary growth capital than what we have assumed in our base plan. Those investment opportunities include additional commercial and regulated renewables, further modernization of the generation fleet and additional gas infrastructure investments. Turning now to slide 11. I'll discuss in more detail our regulated investments over the next five years. The combination of these investments supports the growth rate in our regulated earnings base of approximately 5% from 2016 through 2020. Our capital deployment is directed to the strategic priorities that Lynn discussed : customer focus grid investments, new gas and renewable generation investments and natural gas infrastructure, as demand for gas increases. We expect to invest nearly $8 billion expanding our regulated electric grid infrastructure, including improvements in technology. These investments will enable us to improve the reliability of the grid, reduce outages and restore service faster, and provide real-time information to our customers. We also plan to invest around $8 billion in new generation, including natural gas and renewable assets, as we continue to build an energy system for the future and reduce emissions even further, while maintaining the service reliability our customers expect. Finally, we expect investments of $3 billion for environmental compliance. This amount covers steam effluent requirements and cost to close the initial high-priority coal ash basins in the Carolinas. Our earnings growth from 2016 to 2020 is strong, but not linear, due to the timing of capital deployment and subsequent rate recovery. We see earnings growth accelerating in the 2018 to 2020 timeframe, due to several factors. First, grid and customer investments in Ohio and Indiana build over time and are recovered through rate riders later in the five-year period. Second, our investments in new generation in Florida and the Carolinas, as well as our gas pipeline infrastructures projects, will begin to accelerate in 2018 through 2020. Third, we will be filing a number of rate cases in this time period across many of our utilities in order to recover our capital investments. We expect to file a rate case in Duke Energy Ohio in 2016 and Duke Energy Kentucky in 2017. We also expect cases in the Carolinas in the back half of our five-year plan. We continue to fine tune specific timing based on our capital spending projects, such as the Lee Combined Cycle, the Western Carolinas Modernization Project, and coal ash basin remediation. We have further details of our capital spend and recovering mechanisms by category of investment in our appendix materials. Moving ahead to slide 12. I'll discuss some trends we're monitoring related to our retail load. We are planning for modest growth of 0.5% over the next five years. However, there are a few developing trends that give us optimism for some upside over the coming years. The labor market continues to strengthen, with unemployment and median household incomes improving. Jobs are being created in our service territories, as the Carolinas and Florida were among the top 10 in job growth in 2015. We continue to forecast strong growth in the number of customers, particularly, in the Carolinas and Florida. Additionally, usage per customer which declined during 2013 and 2014 has been essentially flat for the past three consecutive quarters. Certain sectors of the industrial class, such as construction and automotive, remains strong, while the strengthening U.S. dollar has challenged other sectors, such as the steel industry. The strength of our service territories is also supported by robust economic development activities, attracting new businesses and jobs. In 2015, these activities led to the announcement of $3.5 billion in capital investments and over 12,000 new jobs in our six-state service area. As we are planning for a period of sustained modest low growth, it is important that we efficiently manage our cost structure. As outlined on slide 13, we've been successful holding costs down in the past and are targeting to keep our non-fuel O&M costs flat through 2020. The Progress Energy merger integration initiatives focused heavily on the consolidation and optimization of our corporate centers. We made significant investments integrating our IT, HR and financial systems to common platforms. We are now rolling out similar initiatives to the operational parts of the organization in order to achieve our target of flat O&M through 2020. Slide 14, shows a our high-level 2016 cash flows and financing plan. As I mentioned in my opening, our strong balance sheet and credit quality are foundational to our overall financial objectives. Our focus on the core businesses creates a better risk profile, with more predictable and stable earnings and cash flows. We design our financing plans and target credit metrics with those objectives in mind. Our five-year plan includes $700 million of DRIP equity after 2017, designed to bolster the balance sheet to continue funding the increasing level of growth investments we expect in the back end of the planning horizon, such as the Atlantic Coast pipeline and new gas generation. Our financing assumptions outlined on this slide do not include the acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas or the sale of International. We plan to issue between $500 million to $750 million of equity through a forward structure and will finance the remainder with debt at the holding company upon closing. Proceeds from the sale of international will be used to strengthen our balance sheet, helping to fund growth in our core businesses. Now I'd like to provide some perspective on the recent five-year extension of bonus depreciation benefits. This extension will generate cumulative after-tax cash benefits of about $3 billion. However, due to our federal net operating loss tax position, we will see total improved cash flows of around $1 billion, but in the back end of our planning horizon. In the short-term, our federal tax position will keep us from recognizing the manufacturing deduction through 2018, impacting our annual earnings by around $0.05 per share. Moving to slide 15, let's talk about our dividend. We have probably paid a quarterly dividend for 90 consecutive years. Last year, our board approved a 4% increase to the dividend, which was double the previous annual growth rate of around 2%. We continue to target annual growth and the dividend consistent with our long-term 4% to 6% earnings growth. Our dividend is supported by the strong cash flows from our core businesses. Our regulated utilities are distributing between 65% and 70% of their earnings to the parent during the planning horizon, providing strong support to the dividend. Additionally, during the period, we continue to hold the International business. This segment will generate annual cash flows of between $200 million and $300 million to be distributed to the parent. Through 2020, our dividend payout ratio is expected to be between 70% and 75%. We are comfortable with the payout, given the quality of our lower risk core businesses and their more stable earnings and cash flows. I'll close with slide 16, which summarizes our key investor considerations. Duke Energy has tremendous scale, offering an attractive investor value proposition, which includes balanced growth in earnings and dividends over time. We are confident in our ability to grow our core businesses between 4% and 6% through 2020. We will also maintain a strong balance sheet to ensure reliable access to the capital markets, while we finance this growth. With that, let me turn it back over to Lynn for some closing thoughts. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : So, thank you, Steve. Before we take your questions, I just want to underscore a few points that are summarized on slide 17. We are strategically responding to the transformation that is occurring in our industry. We're simplifying our business portfolio to focus on our growing core regulated businesses and our highly-contacted Renewables portfolio. We're enhancing customer value by investing in the grid to improve reliability and the customer experience, while also investing in new natural gas and renewable generation resources, as we prepare the business for a lower carbon future. We operate in strong jurisdictions that are positioned for customer growth over the coming years. Our efficient cost structure, coupled with low natural gas prices allows us to make significant investments, while maintaining very competitive rates for customers. Taken together, the predictable stable earnings and cash flows that we are positioned to generate will support attractive earnings and dividend growth for our investors in the years to come. Now, let's open up the line for questions. Unknown Speaker : Operator : Thank you. And, we'll first hear from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners : Good morning. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Good morning, Shahriar. Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Good morning, Shahriar. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners : Thanks for the additional color on the LatAm assets. Lynn, in your prepared remarks, you kind of highlighted some dilution. So, when we're thinking about net proceeds and the cash you still have left to repatriate, I think it's about $1.5 billion. Should we offset this from a sale amount? So, do you kind of lose these cash flows in a pending sale, or is this cash that sitting in an account that's at your disposal which is additive to evaluation? Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Shahriar, we think about it as acceleration of the amount planned for repatriation. You may recall when we set forth the dividend, it was over a seven-year period,, and it basically represented cash flow that would be generated over that period. So, we've harvested about $1.5 billion, we have $1.2 billion to go, and you can think of part of the proceeds as being acceleration of that. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners : Excellent. And then, just for the proceeds, should we think a little bit more de-levering or potentially lower equity needs? Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : As we look at everything that we've laid out here, Shahriar, the proceeds from International will go a couple of places. One bank to accelerate that repatriation that I just talked about. Those cash flows are already in the plan, we're just brining them forward. And then we will use the rest of the proceeds to fund the growth. So, as we laid out the combination of DRIP equity, whether we take to finance, Piedmont, the growth capital that's in the plan, proceeds of International are part of that financing picture over the five-year period. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners : Got it. And then just lastly, really big jump in renewables for the placeholders. Is that sort of extension of the tax credits, or what's driving that? Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : We have been investing kind of in the range of $500 million to $1 billion for some time, Shahriar, and look to continue that. I think the extension of the credits creates opportunities to do it, but we will continue to be opportunistic if we find projects that may (27:29) return expectations, we'll continue to invest. Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : And that's right. And I would add, our placeholder is about $500 million per year, and we've been able to find investments at that level for the past several years. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Partners : Excellent. Thank you very much. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Thank you. Operator : Next we'll hear from Dan Eggers of Credit Suisse. Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey good morning, guys. Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Hi, Dan. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Hi, Dan. Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Just \u2013 I mean, Steve, if you can go back to the bonus appreciation conversation a little bit and maybe kind of layout when you see those cash flows actually affecting rate base, it seems like the timing will differ when you affect rate base, and we'll have much bearing on when you file the Carolinas cases, as they come towards the back end of the decade? Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. So, let me give a little background on the bonus here. We would expect, Dan, to get about $7 billion of additional deductions from this extension, that translates to maybe $2.73 billion of reduced taxes, but only $1 billion of that's going to be within our planning horizon. We are currently in an NOL position. We weren't expecting to be significant tax payers until 2018, so all that shifts out by two years or three years there. So, it's backend loaded for us looking at the corporate level. So, as we plan rate cases in the back half of this period, we don't see huge impacts necessarily on those filings there. Now, I will say that every utility has its own standalone NOL computation and structure, so there may be some effect on some of these filings in different jurisdictions, as we do the standalone filings. But we have, again, not a dramatic impact, because we're already in this NOL position. Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): So we shouldn't think of the bonuses having a substantive effect on kind of the rate of growth that you've had before or as of today? Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Not during this period through 2020. I don't think it is substantive. The biggest impact on earnings, as we said earlier, is the loss of the manufacturers' deduction of about $0.05 a year through 2018. Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And I guess anything about getting the International proceeds back in? What are the opportunities when you kind of look at the list of things you could do that look most compelling as to redeployment of that capital? Is there transmission spending, is there infrastructure spend? Where do you think you can ramp up and reuse that cash? Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Dan, in looking at what we've laid out, we think discretionary spending opportunities against \u2013 exist throughout our portfolio, whether it's additional grid investment, whether it's additional renewables conversions of our coal fleet to natural gas, transmission is a part of it. But our transmission build has been slow and coming. We have the pioneer project under construction, but we continue to be in development mode there. So, I would look at the discretionary capital as opportunities that exist throughout our portfolio. I would add gas infrastructure to that, perhaps I didn't emphasize that, but gas infrastructure around the Piedmont acquisition and further expansion of the pipelines. Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And I guess one last question is on the dividend. If you look where the dividend's going to be in 2016, against kind of the $4.30 baseline earnings, it kind of puts that payout ratio maybe a bit higher than even the targeted range. How do we think about the growth rate beyond this point, post International sale? Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : We move the growth rate up to 4%, Dan, as you know this year. And the dividend is extraordinarily important. Our commitment to investors to continue to grow it remains unchanged. As we look at this transition in the portfolio, what we're moving to is a lower risk, more predictable, more stable set of earnings and cash flows, which we believe gives us confidence in allowing that payout ratio to trend up slightly. And then over time, if we execute on this plan, as we are committed to doing so, that payout ratio will turn down over time. So, we are confident, looking at this, that we have a growing dividend offering to our investors. Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): So you're good at the 4%, even with International sale? Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Yes. Daniel L. Eggers - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Very good. Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Good morning. Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Good morning, Stephen. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I wanted to think through the tax shield that you might be able to deploy in terms of proceeds, if you were to sell assets in Latin America. Obviously, you'll have to pay, I guess, local taxes upon repatriating the money, but could you speak a little bit further, I know you talked about your tax position somewhat, but in terms of how we should think about the ability to shield proceeds from taxation when you bring the money back to the United States? Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yes, Stephen, tax implications depend upon the sales price and so forth, and I can't get into any of that, but the \u2013 so, we'll be taxable, and we have stripped out basis in the past with our International assets. So, there could be a lower tax basis that could result in a gain. Again, our NOL positioning at our corporate level provides a delay in timing of cash taxes, though, that is useful to us. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : And I think, Stephen, you can think of that NOL position as, in effect, sheltering the timing of the payment of the cash gain on that sale. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Oh, I see. So, as you burn through the NOL over time, then that can reverse itself, but initially, it provides quite a bit of potential benefit in shielding some of those proceeds. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : That's right. Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yes, absolutely. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And then just shifting over big picture to the Clean Power Plan. There's certainly been lots of interesting developments in that regard. At a high level, I'd love any commentary you'd be willing to provide in terms of how you think about potential implications for your planning, in terms of additional spending opportunities, feedback at the state level? Any further color on the Clean Power Plan would be great. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Sure, Stephen, and I know that's a top-of-mind question for many, because it's such a recent development. And I would describe Duke's position on this as one of continuing to work toward modernizing our fleet. If you look back at our track record of the last five years, we have been consistently moving toward lower carbon sources of generation, and we see that continuing. So as I look at this five-year plan, whether this would stay a Clean Power Plan or not, we believe the plan that we're on is one that makes sense for customers, and our communities, and our states. I think the clarity that'll come from this legal review will be helpful, but more helpful to set pace and timing of decisions in the next decade, so in the 2020s and forward. So I would say our states are still grappling with this, understanding it, thinking through their processes. We will be closely working with them. We're trying to find solutions that make the most sense for our customers and communities. But I think for the near term, the strategy will be to watch the litigation and then execute the plan that we already have in front of us in terms of modernizing our system. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Thank you. Operator : And then next, we'll hear from Jonathan Arnold at Deutsche Bank. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Good morning. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Jonathan, how are you? Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I'm good. Thank you. Just quick question. From your answers, I think that it's fairly clear you're contemplating a sale of International, but you use the word exit, which obviously could include other scenarios, like a local listing perhaps. Are we definitely talking about a sale, and are you highly confident that that's an achievable outcome? Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : We are talking about a sale, Jonathan. And, I would confirm that we have been working and evaluating options for some time. I think we began providing some visibility to the Street, in the second quarter and third quarter, about some of the things we saw with the International business. We believe we have very high-quality valuable assets. The asset in Brazil is a hydro asset in Sao Paulo. And we believe prospective buyers will share the view of the value of these assets, and we're confident that we can execute. And, at this point, because the process is early, however, we can't give specifics on timing or valuation, but we'll continue to provide updates in the quarters that follow. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. And then, on the slide on financing, I think it says that the baseline, it's not assuming proceeds. But, just to be clear, would you \u2013 does your $700 million of DRIP, would you still expect to be doing that in the event that you do sell International, or does that actually assume a sale? Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : As I look at this \u2013 kind of the whole complexion of this, Jonathan, the $700 million is really tied to accelerated capital spending in that period, Atlantic Coast Pipeline, the gas generation assets, and more infrastructure that we think will be necessary in those periods. We have not had the DRIP on since 2010. And we believe, with the level of capital spending in our core businesses, that that is an important approach. The proceeds for International, you should think about as being an acceleration of repatriation, and that repatriation was already in the plan. And that we believe the remaining amount would be appropriate for delevering, because the International business has provided a source of FFO in our metrics \u2013 our credit metrics. And so, as we take those out, we believe it's important for us to delever in connection with the rest of those proceeds. So, if you look at the whole thing together, we believe we can execute the capital that's included the acquisition of Piedmont, the divestiture of International and have a very strong balance sheet and growth rate coming out of that five-year period. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Lynn. And just sort of related topic, you talked about wanting to hold investment grade, and you're still on negative outlook, a couple of the agencies, do the \u2013 does this plan, do you think this plan keeps your ratings where they are? Or would you be \u2013 are you okay with seeing them slide another notch? Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : We believe, we've put together a plan that is consistent with our ratings, Jonathan. I can't step into the shoes of the rating agencies, though, with certainty, but we will keep them informed along the way of our plans. Certainly, the Piedmont acquisition, they have been informed of. We'll share our capital plans, we'll share our commitment to equity, and we'll share our progress in the International business. But we are targeting to maintain our ratings, as they are today and believe we can execute this plan consistent with those ratings. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's it. Great. Thank you very much. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Thank you. Operator : And next, we'll hear from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me, Lynn? Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Hi, Steve. Yes. Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Good morning. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Great. Thank you. Just a follow-up on the question of kind of thinking about an International sale. Is there a way to give us a sense of debt that might be kind of allocated to International and also maybe corporate costs that's allocated to International, as we're trying to analyze this? Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Steve, we have in-country debt, that I suspect about $700 million.... Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : $700 million of in-country debt. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : And as you look at the segment of International, I would think of that as being a pretty standalone segment. One of the things we were trying to accomplish with the delineation of earnings here in the base period, just to give you a sense of what cash flows and what earnings come from that business. So, I think that's a good starting point for you. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Great. And then just a clarification, you said a couple of times on the growth rate that it's not linear, and it's kind of, I guess, lower through 2017 and then higher 2018 to 2020? Are those comments kind of within that 4% to 6% range year-by-year, or could it be like below 4%, let's say, before 2018 and then 6% or above in that 2018 to 2020? Just wanted to get a little more color on that comment. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Yeah. And, Steve, it's not going to be linear. So, if you look back even at the 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, the base numbers that we gave you on the slide, I think it's slide seven maybe \u2013 slide nine, because we still have jurisdictions where our ability to reset price comes through a base proceeding, there will be some stare-stop to our earnings as we plan for general rate cases. But if we think about over the five-year period, we'll be situated well within that 4% to 6% range. Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : And I think the trajectory within the five-year period have some variability. As you think about implementation of the Senate Bill 560 in Indiana and the exact timing of rate cases that we see in the back half. So, it's a little difficult to be precise, but we're trying to give you a broader picture there that it is back-loaded. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. And then one last question on coal ash. Could you just remind us where things stand on recovery for the coal ash remediation investments, and just when will we know kind of the recovery plan for that? Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Sure. Steve, we believe coal ash costs are recoverable. We believe they are a part of decommissioning a coal plant and part of complying with environmental rules. And, of course, we have environmental rules in North Carolina, but as you know, there are federal rules as well. So, our focus here in the near-term has been moving through closure planning. We're actually excavating ash at a number of sites and working closely with the environmental agency here in the Carolinas. Our intent would be to seek recovery in connection with a general base rate increase, which as Steve indicated would be toward the latter part of this planning period. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Thanks so much. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Brian Chin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Brian, we thought you'd call in today, if nothing else to talk about in Duke. Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Hello, Brian. Boy, what a (43:09) talking about, but... Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : What journalists do, talk a little basketball. Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Right. Oh, my goodness. (43:22) Brian J. Chin - Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I will certainly follow-up offline with you on that, very important. I noticed on \u2013 in the back, on slide 57, there's been a little bit of a delay in the construction of this facility, and so DEI share maybe delayed now till early 2017. Is that the sole reason why it's been delayed, is the construction facility? Is there a potential for the ownership stake to change \u2013 for that change to be delayed, yet again, down the road? Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : It's only construction, Brian, that's all is going on. Brian J. Chin - Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. That's it from me. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Thank you so much. Operator : Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Can you hear me? Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Yes. Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yes. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Good morning Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. I would just want to follow up first on Steve's question a little bit further. How are you thinking about recovery in terms of capital versus O&M of the coal ash? They're kind at some split with the latest thinking, as you begin to prepare those filings and get going there. Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Julien, the way I would think about this is whether it's capital or O&M, it is a cost that we have incurred \u2013 a cash cost that we have incurred. And this cash cost to the extent that it is outside of rates can be incorporated into rates, at some point in time, in any fashion that the commission deems agreeable to do. We've deferred purchase power cost in the past and recovered it with a return off and on. We've certainly recovered capital costs, say, of a power plant that \u2013 prior to its buildup and incorporation into rates. So, I think, conceptually, we just view it as a cost incurred for an extended period, therefore requires financing and recovery off and on in a subsequent rate proceeding. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And, I just want to clarify a little bit more on the discretionary capital budget that you delineated. It seems as an offset, largely, to the bonus depreciation bucket. Can you give us a little bit more sense as to what exactly is in there, the timing of having it realized? I suppose, just getting a sense of confidence there around, particularly, 2016 and 2017, the near-dated spend? How firm are you? Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Since there are a variety of projects, at any point in time, Julien, that we are advancing and working on and planning, and then looking for the appropriate timing, given jurisdictions, given value that we can demonstrate to customers, given potential transactions that could arise. So, they're always in development. And I think, if you look at our track record over the last several years, Eastern Power Agency would have been a discretionary capital item at one point in our thinking. Western Carolina modernization would have been discretionary capital. And so, there are always a variety of projects underway. And I would generally describe, that we have more good ideas, than we actually end up funding. We're trying to make prioritized choice of things that make the most sense for our customers. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And just a further clarification on the latest growth rate bifurcation. If indeed you do \u2013 if you close on the Piedmont transaction, would that drive you that 5% to 6%, or would you need to see that in conjunct with other factors, just to be clear about that? How much would that drive you to the upper end? Just I think it (47:13)? Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : We believe its accretive. And on a full year basis, in 2017, it would be accretive to the growth rate, so you can think about it as being above our base plan today, consistent with the way we've represented it on the slide, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Thanks so much. Operator : Next we'll hear from Hugh Wynne of Bernstein. Hugh D. Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Hi, Hugh. Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Hello, Hugh. Hugh D. Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. I just want to make sure I understood your question to \u2013 your answer to Steve Fleishman's question. Were you all saying that the growth rate in earnings will remain within this 4% to 6% band, but maybe at the lower end in the early years, and at the higher end in the later years? Or were \u2013 was the answer that the growth rate across the five-year period will be in the 4% to 6% band, but it could fall outside of that band in the early years and exceed within the later years? Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : So, the way we answered the question, Hugh, was to say over the planning period, we'll be within 4% to 6%, but we would expect lesser growth in the early period, stronger growth in the later period. We did not give specific percentages year-by-year. Our typical practice is to provide a guidance for 2016, and then will continue to work and provide you better perspective on 2017. But I think it's fair to say, lighter in the frontend, stronger in the backend. Hugh D. Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just wondering if I could ask you to comment on your vision for growth in gas transmission and gas distribution over a five-year timeframe. When the acquisition of Piedmont took place I think that was positioned, in part, as giving critical mass and a respected management team that you could then use to perhaps conduct other acquisitions. How was your thinking evolved around that? Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Yeah, we're continuing to work on the business plan around Piedmont, Hugh. I think if you look at their underlying fundamentals, their growing rate base at about 9% in the jurisdictions that they operate in today. They're, of course \u2013 have some pipeline investments of their own. They're on ATP in (49:37) constitution. So, we are building upon that. We're also looking at integration planning. And what our \u2013 but our plan is to lay out a more specific gas infrastructure plan, as we get closer to the closing of Piedmont. It gives us an opportunity to finalize our regulatory approvals and set out for you where we think that can go. We took a small step today by showing you where it sits in the overall growth rate of Duke, both in terms of Piedmont and additional gas infrastructure, giving us potential to be higher in our range, but more specifics than that, we will wait until we're closer to closing. Hugh D. Wynne - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Thank you. Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Operator : Chris Turnure of JPMorgan. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Good morning. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I wanted to just follow-up on International a little bit here. Could you speak to the difference in performance of the Brazilian assets versus the rest of the generation company in Argentina and Peru and Chile, down there? And then maybe also to the extent that you'd be willing to comment \u2013 would a partial sale of the assets still accomplish your goals with this type of strategic move? Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Let me back up and talk a little bit about portfolio, or Steve, do you want to take the portfolio question? Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : No, go ahead. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : So, Brazil is our single largest asset and contributor to International. If you look at Peru, we've got a combination of hydro and thermal assets. If you look at Argentina, same; Chile, same; and those markets are generally very good markets. I actually think, with the presidential election in Argentina, it's looking better situated for the long term. And so, as we think about an exit, our expectation or intent is to exit the whole portfolio, but whether we exit it altogether or individual assets, or some combination of assets, I think that will remain to be seen as the process continues. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : (52:01) Sure. Thank you. Operator : Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey guys. Real quick question. When you look at the regulated utilities, and I know as a group, you're kind of expecting 4% to 6% over a number of years, can you just comment on which of those utilities could be above that into the band, and which of those utilities might be below, or maybe even just higher level? Which of your utilities you see as growing earnings faster versus slower? Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Yes, Michael. Let me give you a little bit of color on this, and this changes over time as you move through rate cases and so forth. But Ohio has strong growth, in that it has mechanisms put in place to efficiently turn grid investments into earnings. Indiana is looking strong as we implement the Senate Bill 560, the t-disc (53:02) rider that will allow us to make investments in that area. Florida is solid with the Citrus County, Hines and Osprey facilities coming into play. The Carolinas look at growth in earnings between rate cases as being a bit more challenging. And then you see a big jump in the rate cases as the investments then get turned into earnings. And there's a number of good investments there that are coming with Lee Combined Cycle and the Western Carolinas Modernization, that's later in the period there. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : And Duke Energy progress, Michael, has had very good growth as a result of the Eastern Power Agency acquisition and has growth around wholesale contracts as well. So, we actually look at each utility individually in terms of their growth potential, earnings and cash flow generation, and are always looking for where we can prioritize investment to maximize the value of the total company. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks guys. Much appreciated. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Thanks so much. Unknown Speaker : : Thanks. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Hi, Angie. Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Hello, Angie. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : That was close, wasn't it? Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: I was wondering \u2013 okay. So, just a simple math of what's happening. So, you have $0.30 of earnings from International operations, roughly were about $0.10 or even slightly less comes from the Methanol plant, so that's the one \u2013 those are the earnings that stay. And you're telling us that the 4% to 6% of growth in your core earnings already reflects some of the cash that is coming from the International operations that are being sold? So, where is the benefit? I mean, I noticed you saying that there is some dilution of the sale, but I mean, that would imply that the dilution is way north of $0.15, right, because I'm looking at least $0.20 of earnings from International operations, and it doesn't seem like I'm gaining anything on the core business? Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Yeah, so I would look at a couple of things, Angie. First of all, the proceeds that accelerate repatriation will delever more quickly, the holding company. And then you do have proceeds that are in addition to the repatriation that will delever as well. So... Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Well, I know, but shouldn't that be increasing my earnings \u2013 my core earnings, because I have less interest expense? Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Yes. And the way I would describe this is, we are working through a transition in our portfolio. We're starting at $4.30 with the core business. We will use proceeds from International coming into our earnings over the next five years to provide a source of funding for growth. And National Methanol, with the change in the ownership percentage that will occur in 2017, will only be a few pennies, handful of pennies, they should get out there into that timeframe. So, it is this part of \u2013 all of that transition is part of our confidence around financing the growth investments that we've laid out for you in the core business. Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Thank you. Operator : And our final question for today will come from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Hello, Ali. Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Hello. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Good morning. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: First question, can you just remind us, what is the size of the regulatory lag in the utilities right now? And with the five-year plan, are you assuming a significant dent in that, or does that remain relatively constant in your plan? Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : We have described, on slide 10, regulatory lag over the five-year period is about negative 3% on earnings, and that will vary year-per-year. Regulatory lag is depreciation and interest and property taxes, basically on capital investments that are closed prior to a rate case. And that'll build up, then you have a rate case and regulatory lag will drop, and then start building back again. So, it's an average, we looked at it over the period. And it's in the ballpark of 3% negative to the overall earnings trajectory. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then, second, you alluded to \u2013 on the financing for the Piedmont acquisition and the roughly $500 million to $700 million forward equity issuance. Any sense of timing \u2013 any particular threshold you're looking at? What that \u2013 is it earlier than later? How are you thinking about that? Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Well. Let me discuss that a little bit, Ali. We will be looking at doing that fairly soon. We want to have some flexibility here. We looked at doing it in the fourth quarter last year, after the announcement, but we were getting into the holiday timeframe, the markets were a little bit volatile, so we held off. Now, we're in a blackout period, as we're closing the books, and we'll be issuing the 10-K in late February. That will open us up to have the ability to do that, and we'll start looking at the timing of the forward then. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I see. And, last question, the $140 million of net income that you've assumed for Commercial in 2016 as part of your guidance, can you remind us how much of that is the upfront recognition of tax credits versus sort of ongoing earnings? Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : That represents primarily Renewables in 2016, Ali. There is a little bit of earnings around pipeline transmission and other things here in the Commercial Portfolio. But, the lion share of that is Renewables. And so, of course, it'll influenced by PTCs and ITC. We have a heavier mix of PTC contribution and ITC, just given the mix of assets that we own. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: So, Lynn is that \u2013 75%, 80% of that is tax credit recognition. That's the way we should think about it? Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : I think it's substantial amount or the economics of Renewables is from tax credit. So, there's a little bit in there, as I said, around infrastructures, and not all of its Renewables, but I think your percentage is around Renewable business, so are probably about right. So, I think with the $140 million, you have a sense of the relative size of that contribution. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yes. Okay. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Great. Thank you. Steven K. Young - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer : Thank you. Operator : And at this time, I'll turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing comments. Lynn J. Good - President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chair of the Board : Well, thank you, everyone. We certainly had a lot of material today with the year-end call. Look forward to having ongoing conversations with you over the next few days and weeks as you continue to digest what we're trying to accomplish here. We're excited about the strategy, have a lot to accomplish in 2016, and look forward to having these conversations with you. So, thanks for joining today. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation.",

Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Duke Energy First Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Bill Currens. Please go ahead, sir. Bill Currens - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Yolanda. Good morning everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's first quarter 2016 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide two presents the Safe Harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today's materials. Please note that the appendix to today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. As summarized on slide three, Lynn will cover our first quarter financial and operational highlights and provide an update of our recent strategic and growth initiatives. Then Steve will provide an overview of our first quarter financial results, an, update on economic activities within our service territories and close with our key investor considerations. With that, I'll turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased with our solid first quarter financial results, our continued focus on operational performance and the progress we've made on our strategic portfolio transition and important growth initiatives. I'll provide an update on our progress on these initiatives in just a moment. First, let me begin with a few financial and operational highlights of the first quarter as summarized on slide four. This morning we announced first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $1.13. Results for our regulated utilities were modestly below our internal plan as a result of significant storm costs in the Carolinas, milder weather and weaker than expected customer volumes. We continue to see strong customer growth and our 12-month rolling average volumes continue to track consistently with our expectations. Operating results for our international business were in line with our expectations as hydrology began to return to more normal levels in Brazil. We also recognized tax adjustments at international during the quarter, which Steve will review in a movement. As we've looked at the balance of the year, we are affirming our full year 2016 guidance range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share. Daily operational excellence continues to underpin our commitment to our customers, communities and investors. That commitment starts with our focus on safety. For 2015, Duke Energy's employees safety record received the top rank among large utilities as recognize by EEI. Our generation fleet also performed well during the quarter. Our nuclear fleet achieved a 95% capacity factor, building on its record breaking performance in 2015. In Indiana, our Edwardsport IGCC facility continues to improve its operational performance. In February the gasifiers achieved 100% availability, our best month ever. Our growing natural gas fleet is also benefiting customers and the environment, taking advantage of low natural gas prices. In March of this year, our gas-fired plant set a record for monthly natural gas consumption, surpassing the record set last June. This is indicative of the strategic coal-to-gas shift in our generation portfolio, which has enabled us to reduce carbon emissions by 28% since 2005. Our organization responded well to weather challenges in the first quarter. In January, Winter Storm Jonas struck the Carolinas causing approximately 600,000 customer outages. There were also ice and wind storms in February, impacting more than 500,000 customers in the Carolinas. Our teams performed admirably during these events, continuing to provide customers with the level of service they've come to expect. Next let me update you on our coal ash basin closure activities in the Carolinas. We continue to make outstanding progress with closure activities underway at six sites. For each of our basins, the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality is required by statue to recommend risk classifications. Preliminary classifications were released at the end of January followed by a public comment period. We expect DEQ to finalize their classifications shortly. The risk classifications will impact basin closure methods, timing and costs. Based on our comprehensive engineering analysis of our basins, we believe the majority of the remaining unclassified basins meet the requirements for a low classification, allowing 15 years and closure methods which include storing the ash in place. W are committed to safe basin closure in a way that protects our communities and the environment, while minimizing cost to customers. We will keep you informed as the regulatory review process continues to advance. Turning to slide five. I'll highlight several recent milestones in our important growth initiatives. Our five-year capital plan through 2020 includes a deployment of between $25 billion and $30 billion in growth capital in new natural gas-fired generation, grid investment, commercial and regulated renewables and gas pipeline infrastructure. These investments are directed at improving customer service, modernizing our generation fleet and the electric grid, as well as investing in natural gas infrastructure that is complementary to our system. These investments support our transition toward businesses that provide stable, long-term growth in earnings and the dividend. During the quarter, we received approval from the North Carolina Utilities Commission for our $1 billion Western Carolinas modernization project in Ashville. This allows us to move forward with retiring the Asheville Coal Plant by 2020 and replacing it with two highly efficient natural gas combined cycle units. In South Carolina, construction of our $700 million W.S. Lee Natural Gas Combined Cycle Plant is well underway. The project is on budget and on target for a November 2017 in-service date. We also broke ground on our $1.5 billion natural gas-fired Citrus County Combined Cycle Plant in Florida, staying on track for a 2018 in-service date. We're building on our success and growing our commercial and regulated renewable assets. In our commercial portfolio, our two 200-megawatt wind projects, Los Vientos IV and Frontier are on target to come online later this year. Since the beginning of the year, we've announced the acquisition of nine new solar projects including eight in North Carolina. In our regulated utilities, we've announced 100 megawatts of planned solar installations for 2016 in the Carolinas, Florida, and Indiana. That's already about 75% of what we achieved in 2015, which was a very strong year for solar investment. In fact, Duke Energy progress was ranked third among all utilities in 2015 for bringing new solar capacity online. Additionally, as pictured on this slide, we recently completed an iconic solar farm to serve the power needs of Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando. In the first quarter, we also made good progress in our grid modernization efforts. In March, we announced a settlement agreement with nearly all interveners including key consumer groups on our seven-year Indiana T&D infrastructure investment program. The $1.4 billion plan will provide much needed technology and infrastructure upgrades that will benefit customers, providing improved reliability and safety, fewer and shorter power outages, better information, and overall energy savings. In addition, the settlement allows us to continue evaluating the installation of smart meters in our Indiana service territory, which would be eligible for recovery in a future rate case. The grid modernization hearings with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission began yesterday, and we expect a decision around mid-year. Our two commercial natural gas pipeline infrastructure projects, Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Sabal Trail, continue moving forward. Sabal Trail received FERC approval in February, and the pipeline is on target to begin construction in the second quarter and be in operation in 2017. Atlantic Coast Pipeline is also progressing and has adopted several alternate routes, increasing the lengths of the pipeline from about 550 miles to just under 600 miles. The project partners recently submitted updated information related to these alternative routes as well as responses to all of FERC's outstanding environmental information requests. We're confident that FERC will soon be able to issue its draft environmental impact statement, the next important project milestone. And in fact, I believe that statement was issued this morning. The project partners have devoted significant time and resources to ensure that the environmental issues have been fully addressed. And as a result, we've adjusted our expectation for receipt of the FERC certificate to mid-2017. We are still planning for a late 2018 in-service date for the project. Turning to slide six, I will address recent activities around the strategic transition of our overall business portfolio toward regulated and contracted electric and gas infrastructure businesses. The two strategic transactions highlighted on this slide will complete the realignment of our portfolio to focus entirely on domestic businesses that drive more stable earnings and cash flows. Let's start with our pending acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas. In March, we received approval from the Tennessee Regulatory Authority for a change in control upon acquisition by Duke Energy. The final remaining approval is with the North Carolina Utilities Commission, which has scheduled hearing for July 18. We remain confident of closing the transaction before the end of this year. Additionally, at the end of February, we successfully priced a common stock offering to fund the equity portion of the Piedmont acquisition. The $766 million offering was well received by our investors. As a reminder, the shares were offered in a forward structure. This means we will not issue the shares until the forward is settled at the time the Piedmont transaction closes. We are also progressing on the planned exit of our Latin American generation business. We've begun initial steps in marketing the assets including signing nondisclosure agreements and providing information to interested parties. This business includes high quality assets, which we believe will attract significant interest for potential buyers. We will keep you updated on this important strategic transition. In conclusion, I'm pleased with our financial results for the quarter and our progress in advancing our growth investments. We're also maintaining a sharp focus on operational excellence, which includes our commitment to safety and cost efficiency. Our business portfolio transition positions Duke as an industry-leading domestic infrastructure business with stable, transparent earnings and cash flows. We're looking forward to continuing our progress on this transition throughout 2016. Now, let me turn it over to Steve. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Lynn. Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment to thank Bill Currens for his seven years as a leader with the Investor Relations team. Bill's tireless commitment to delivering accurate, transparent information to our analysts and investors has been outstanding. I will look forward to continuing to work with him in his new role as our Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer & Controller. As many of you know, Mike Callahan is succeeding Bill as Vice President of Investor Relations. Currently Mike serves as Director of Regulated Utilities Forecasting. He has also had extensive experience in treasury, financial planning and analysis, and investor relations. We're delighted he's returning to IR to lead the team, where he will continue our efforts to serve our shareholders and investors. Today, I'll focus on four primary areas. First, I'll discuss the major drivers of our first quarter results and provide an update to our full-year adjusted EPS guidance range for 2016. I'll discuss our retail volume trends and the economic conditions within our service territories. I'll spend a few moments on the continued cost management efforts underway, and then I will close with a review of our key investor considerations. Let's start with the quarterly results. I will cover the highlights on slide seven. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release. First quarter adjusted diluted earnings were $1.13 per share compared to $1.24 in the first quarter of 2015. The lower results in the current year reflect milder winter weather in 2016 and the absence of Midwest generation results due to the successful sale of the business in April 2015. Additionally in 2016, we incurred significant winter storm costs and somewhat softer retail volumes, which were offset by a tax adjustment at international. On a reported basis, 2016 first quarter earnings per share were $1.01 compared to $1.22 last year. Let me briefly review key quarterly earnings drivers at each of our business segments. On an adjusted basis, regulated utilities results declined by $0.11 per share, principally driven by the milder weather in the Carolinas and Midwest. Higher revenues from pricing and riders in the Carolinas and Ohio were mostly offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense due to additional plant in service, including the acquisition of the NCEMPA assets in July 2015. Additionally, we incurred higher O&M expense during the quarter as a result of winter storm cost in the Carolinas, which were higher than our planning assumptions by $0.05. Offsetting emergent storm expenses were lower outage costs and increased cost efficiencies throughout the organization. As expected, our commercial portfolio declined by $0.11 per share in the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to the absence of the Midwest generation business, which was sold in April of 2015. Our commercial renewables benefited from improved levels of wind production this quarter and growth from new renewable projects. Other was down $0.06 per share, primarily due to prior year tax adjustments and higher interest expense in the quarter. Moving to international operational performance, in particular in Brazil, strengthened during the quarter. Hydrology in Brazil has improved significantly during the recent rainy season. Reservoir levels in southeast Brazil are approximately 60%, compared to around 30% this time last year. This improvement has resulted in increased hydro production throughout Brazil and lower purchased power costs to meet our contractual commitments. We also had $0.11 of favorable tax related items associated with the international segment during the quarter, which represents the impact of several events. You will recall in the fourth quarter of 2014, we declared a $2.7 billion dividend at international in order to efficiently bring funds back to the US. In early 2016, we announced our intent to exit the international business. This decision, combined with the extension of bonus depreciation by Congress in late 2015, allows us to more efficiently utilize foreign tax credits and reduce our US income taxes. As a result of our intent to exit the international business, we will recognize additional US income taxes for international up until the point of sale. Overall, and with our first quarter results, we remain on track to achieve our 2016 guidance range of between $4.50 to $4.70 per share. Moving onto slide eight, I'll now discuss our retail customer volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather-normalized retail load growth was 0.7% through the first quarter. For the first quarter, our retail load growth trends were soft. Within the residential sector, we continued to experience strong growth in the number of new customers, approximately 1.3% over the recent 12 months. However, after moderating for most of 2015, residential customer usage trends have declined during the quarter due to the slow economic recovery and adoption of energy efficiency initiatives. Employment and wage growth trends continue to be favorable for the residential sector, along with the improving housing sector. The commercial and industrial classes continue to grow, to show growth of 0.2% and 1.1% respectively over the rolling 12 months. The commercial sector continues to be supported by office vacancy rate declines and job creation remains strong. Offsetting this growth is the governmental sector, as many agencies face tighter budgets, elimination of jobs and adoption of energy efficiency measures. As for the industrial sector, construction, automotives and textiles continue to show strength in the Carolinas and Midwest. Other industrial companies continue to reduce production as they work through unusually high inventory levels accumulated in 2015. However, the softer global economies and the stronger dollar is still impacting companies that compete globally, such as steel and metals. Our 12-month trends continue to track to our planning assumptions, despite a weak first quarter. We will continue to closely monitor customer usage patterns as we progress through the year. Moving to slide nine, as we continue to position our company for a low load growth environment, I'd like to spend just a moment discussing the progress that we made in managing costs across the organization. So far this year, absent the emerging storm costs, O&M is tracking favorable to the prior year, which is consistent with our expectations. We are focused on standardization of our operational processes and systems to manage our business much more efficiently. We also continued to take advantage of the flexibility and cost savings associated with the transition of our generation portfolio from coal to natural gas. Also within our nuclear and fossil generation fleets, we're making changes in how we plan and execute our plant outages and how we utilize resources across our fleet. Although the Nuclear Promise is an industry-wide approach to controlling costs, activities are already underway within our nuclear fleet to drive out cost and place more discipline on capital allocation. In our transmission and distribution businesses, we continue to pursue technology that not only provides greater reliability and information for our customers, but also helps control work volumes, metering costs and contractor needs. I'll close with slide 10, which summarizes our key investor considerations. Duke Energy has tremendous scale, offering an attractive investor value proposition, which includes balanced growth in earnings and dividends over time. As Lynn mentioned, we are making excellent progress on the acquisition of Piedmont and the exit of the international business. After the completion of this strategic transition, we will operate a portfolio that provides lower risk and higher quality earnings and cash flows to support growth in both earnings and the dividend. Our strong capital plan includes the transition toward a lower carbon future as we retire coal and build new efficient combined cycle natural gas and renewable resources. We're excited about the growth opportunities for natural gas infrastructure across our service territories, particularly in the Southeast. Our electric grid investments allow us to deliver higher levels of reliability and offer new innovative products and services to our customers. Our dividend is very important to us. We continue to target annual growth in the dividend consistent with our long-term 4% to 6% earnings growth objective. Strong cash flows from our core businesses support our dividend. We are only one quarter into the year, but remain on track to achieve the $4.50 to $4.70 adjusted earnings per share guidance range for 2016. With that, let's open the line for your questions. Bill Currens - Vice President- Investor Relations : Okay. Greg, I think we've got you first in the queue. We'll go to Greg Gordon. Greg? Operator, if you can hear us, we'll go ahead and take Q&A now. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We appear that we having some technical difficulty. So, we'll wait for a few minutes to see if we can establish the line for questions. Bill Currens - Vice President- Investor Relations : If everyone could just bear with us for one second. They had a fire alarm over at the operator's location. So just bear with us for a second here. Operator : We'll take our first question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Hey. Thanks. Bill, first of all I wanted to say congratulations. You've run a fantastic IR program. You're leaving it in great hands as well. Bill Currens - Vice President- Investor Relations : Great. Thank you for that comment Greg. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Yes. Good morning. How are you? So, couple of questions on tax. So you're ahead of the game on tax and international. I was a little bit distracted when you were going through that part of your script, so can you rehash what's going on there? And does that effectively put you ahead of target for the year for that segment, since you're already more than halfway there in the first quarter on your targeted guidance assumptions? Or is the tax drag year-over-year from other parts of the business offsetting it? And finally, you're at a 26% effective tax rate year-to-date. Are you still expecting it to be 32%, 33% levelized over the course of the year, or is that also trending better? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So Greg, let me start with a little explanation on the tax adjustment, then I'll turn it to Steve on specifics around effective tax rate. So coming into this year, we had the extension of bonus depreciation and then the planned announcement of the exit of international, put us in a position where we could relook at the tax consequences of the sale of the business and we are going to be in a position to utilize more of our foreign tax credits, which is real economic benefit from the combination of the extension of bonus and the decision to exit. And so that economic benefit is being reflecting in the first quarter. It does put us ahead of our first quarter plan on international as a result of that. But also as we indicated in the script, we will begin recognizing tax expense, because we will no longer be making the assertion that the proceeds do not come onshore and that tax expense will be reflected over the balance of the year. So, ahead of plan through the first quarter, good economic benefit from the tax planning that the team has accomplished here, and I'll turn it to Steve to talk about effective tax rate. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, we had expected and forecasted an effective tax rate for the year of about 32% to 33%. I think it will be lower than that. You might lower it by 1% on that range, as a result of the tax strategies we put forth related to international. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. So some portion of that $0.11 will flow back, but there will be a net benefit when we look back at the end of the fiscal year. Is that a fair summary? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's correct. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, that's true. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's correct. A modest amount will turn, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. I think I understand. Thank you, guys. I'll cede to the next question. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you, guys. That was actually going to be my first question. So, I'll ask my second one which was on the international sale. Can you give any insight at this stage whether you feel it's more likely the assets get sold in one block or in packages or some other structure? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Jonathan, we're pleased with where we are on the process. There's been good market interest in the assets. We're still in preliminary phases. So, I can't speak to whether or not the transaction will be a single transaction or a combination. Our objective will be to optimize the value of the portfolio. And as the year progresses, we'll keep you informed on timing and expectations. But I would say we're off to a solid start on the process. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Are you committed to exiting everything, or is it possible that there would be a partial sale if that was the better value outcome? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We've made a decision to exit, and are certainly in that process today, Jonathan, and as we move through it we'll have a better sense of timing and approach. So, I think that's a question that we'll be prepared to give more specifics on as the year progresses. But again, we're off to a good start with the degree of market interest we're seeing in the assets. Bill Currens - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you. And thank you to you as well Bill. And good luck. Bill Currens - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Jonathan. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : We'll go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks for that peaceful moment there earlier. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We didn't know what was going on for awhile. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I know, when we figured out it was a fire alarm, it has to be one of the first ever. Mr. Currens (32:20) on his final call. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yes. So, we'll always remember your final call, Bill. So, just one other clarification on the international. There were Bloomberg Radio story headlines this morning that seemed to imply there was a comment from that saying that the dilution from the sale would be less than you had thought going forward. That's not what you said though here in this call. So, could you just clarify, did you say something about that or is there anything to add there? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Steve, thanks for that question. So it's kind of all a part of this discussion around economic value from this tax adjustment. So, we still intend, believe the transaction will be dilutive. We'll give more visibility on valuation as the process continues. But the fact that we've had a tax planning strategy here that has provided an economic value reflected in the first quarter is significant. It's a combination of bonus and the decision to sell. So that was the point I was making. But we'll know more on the valuation of the entire transaction as the year progresses. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. But there just to, I'm sorry to clarify again. So you were referring to the benefit that you got in this first quarter. There is not some other tax benefits that occur post sale that we weren't. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's correct. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Great. And then, just maybe on the clarifying kind of going back to last call. So you had said before, the 4% to 6% growth rate and it's going to be kind of maybe kind of lower toward the beginning of the period, then rising toward the end of the period. Is that still kind of the way you look at it? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's correct, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We don't expect linear, just given the timing of our capital deployment, the approach we take toward rate cases and resetting our prices. But over the five-year period, we believe we have the capital investments, the growth initiatives that will drive growth within our 4% to 6% targeted range. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then lastly, I think Piedmont has a stake in the Constitution Pipeline. I mean, I'm sure that's not a huge part of the company, but just does that affect much at all your kind of expectations there, the delay? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, we've been following that closely. Steve, and of course are disappointed in the ruling in the State of New York. I think the partners in the projects have been very clear on where they are and the fact that they are reviewing a number of options to go forward. At this point, we're planning for a delay in the project. But as these options are pursued, some of which could include resubmission or appeal through the courts, we'll have a better sense of timing and outcome, so more to come on that. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : And their stake is like $250 million, is that the right number? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Around $200 million. Around $200 million, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Okay. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll move next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Julien. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Get it started. So, a few clarifying questions here. Following up on Steve's last question, how do you think about hitting the bottom end of the range through at least the near-term period? Just to kind of clarify that. Do you expect to be able to hit that 4% in the subsequent years, especially given the year-to-date start and where the sales process is et cetera? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You know, Julien, I think our guidance on that is as it was at the end of the year. We have reaffirmed our range of $4.50 to $4.70 for this year. We're in the midst of portfolio transition with the sale of international and the acquisition of Piedmont, both of which we expect to make substantial progress on in 2016. That will have bearing on 2017 and forward, so we'll give you a better sense of 2017 as we get close. We're confident in the range. We believe it will be nonlinear, as we've talked about, but don't have anything further to say on that at this point. But we're working hard on all elements of both growth initiatives, capital deployment, pursuing rate cases at the right time, and moving aggressively through the transition in the portfolio. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : And then a quick follow-up on pension accounting here. We've seen some companies in the sector pursue some new policies on discount rates. I'd be curious, is that something you all are reviewing? Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We keep abreast of the various accounting rules and options available to us and those are things that we look at with a regular basis and we're keeping an eye on those things. We're aware of the different methods of selecting discount rates, yield curves, bond methods, spot methods, so we're keeping an eye on that. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Just no decisions at this point. Julien. Those decisions will be finalized in connection with our year-end planning process. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : So, would that still affect potentially this year? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, no decisions have been made at this point. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No decisions, and typically a decision like that would impact prospective years. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. And then, more strategic question here. As you think about the gas expansion that you are undertaking by the acquisition of Piedmont, how are you thinking about future expansions or exposures on the gas side of the equation? And specifically here, either more gas utilities or more importantly, I suppose the more direct midstream pipeline exposure. I'd be curious. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Julien, we're excited about what the potential of the Piedmont acquisition represents for Duke and our focus here in 2016 is on closing the transaction and also progressing Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Sabal Trail. We also see growth within the Piedmont franchise, both with customer additions as well as infrastructure that would support gas generation here in the Carolinas. So, we expect to continue to build on that platform in particular. We'll look at assets that make sense for Duke, whether they're midstream or local distribution companies, but don't have anything more specific to share with you at this point. We're focused on closing the transaction and integrating it in a successful way. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Turnure with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Chris. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. I had a more specific question on timing for the international sale. I do respect that it's still relatively early in the process, but it's my understanding that you really got the ball rolling back in January, so it's been a couple months now. At least you do have those I guess confidentiality agreements in place, and you are in discussions. Maybe it would be helpful to hear a best case scenario here knowing what you know, in terms of timing for the ultimate close of the transaction. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. And you know, Chris, the ball was rolling in January and February on planning. The ball began rolling into the market with discussions with counterparties on non-disclosure agreements and interest more in the late March, April timeframe. And so we are two months into that process. The data room, the data book is in the hands of prospective buyers, and over the next couple of months, we'll be learning more about degree of interest, number of parties that intend to stay in the process, and we'll have more to update in the second quarter. I just you know, given where we are, I don't have any more specifics to share with you. Jonathan I believe or someone asked earlier about, is it one transaction or multiple. That of course would impact timing. Our objective is to optimize the value of the portfolio, and we're going to move through this in a thoughtful way to accomplish exactly that. And we'll give you more specifics when we are further into the process. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. And then my second question is on Atlantic Coast Pipeline. We did have the delay in the start of construction I guess that you gave some color on in your prepared remarks, but the overall cost and completion date remains unchanged. Is there any more information that you can give us there in terms of the drivers of that delay and start of construction and maybe moving pieces within the lack of change of completion date and lack of change of total costs that might have kind of netted to no effect there, I guess. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Chris, there has been a very active engagement on the part of the partners throughout this process and the delay in receipt of FERC approval has really been the result of pursuing alternate routes and addressing environmental and stakeholder concerns along the way. So the schedule, as originally developed, had contingency timing in it which we've continued to work actively with our partners, including you know the way we're engaging with contractors. And at this point believe that we are on target for a mid-2017 approval from FERC, which should give us an ability to continue to target late 2018 for in-service. So, a lot of good work has been going on to look at a variety of alternatives and to work with the contingency that was within the original project plan. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, that makes sense. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Couple of easy ones. Can you all talk about how much utility O&M was down year-over-year in the quarter excluding the impact of storms? Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, Michael. The O&M, the non-recoverable types O&M was down $0.04 year-over-year in the quarter. And again, we had about $0.05 of storms delta quarter-over-quarter offsetting that. But we had the $0.04 benefit. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then CapEx in the quarter came in, like if I just annualize that number, that would imply a year-end number several billion below kind of what you highlighted for 2016 levels. Should we just assume CapEx is very back-end loaded in the course of this year or is there a kind of downside potential to that CapEx number? Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think our original capital plans for the years are still intact. I think it's just a shaping during the year. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And Michael, if you look back even at 2015, we spent about 20% of capital last year. We're kind of in that range this year in the first quarter, and then it picks up over the course of the year. So the pattern looks similar to what we've experienced in previous years. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then finally, can you just remind us what are your thoughts or plans around rate case timing across the various utilities or across your system? Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, Michael. As we had mentioned in the February call, we're looking at the majority of these cases to be back loaded in the five-year timeframe. But that's always subject to scrutiny of costs and events that are going on at the time. And in fact, we are looking at accelerating a rate case. We may file a notice this year for our filing for Duke Energy Progress South Carolina jurisdiction. So we're always looking at what's the appropriate time to go in, what's our cost structure look like and the investment timing related to that. I'd still say that the majority of the cases are in the back end of the five-year timeframe. But the South Carolina is an example of an opportunity we have that we need to move on perhaps earlier. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Yeah. I asked that question only because if I look at the quarterly demand rather than the rolling 12 months, while it's really strong in the Carolinas, Florida has been a little bit weaker and Indiana and Ohio especially in this quarter were significantly weak on a weather normalized basis. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Michael, the rate case timing in Florida, you may recall, we have the GBRAs in place in connection with the building of the plants and that along with that, has a stay-out through 2018, I believe. And then in Indiana, we've been pursuing the T-disc, the grid investment, which will give us an ability to track and that will in hearing hopeful to get approval in Indiana, which will give us an opportunity to reset prices for those investments. And we'll continue to monitor whether load trends and other things would change our timing in Indiana, but we believe the tracker that we're pursuing is the highest priority rate activity in that jurisdiction. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Jim von Riesemann with Mizuho. Please go ahead. James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: I am all set. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jim. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Jim. Operator : We'll move to our next caller then, Praful Mehta with Citi. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, guys. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hello. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hello. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): So, my quick question was, you mentioned on growth on the gas side that you might look at other gas assets. So just to clarify, are you talking about building on your platform for gas with acquisitions or are you looking for organic growth to build on your gas platform? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : The first objective is to close the sale, or close the purchase of Piedmont Natural Gas. And we believe that we'll have organic growth opportunities within that platform not only for new customer additions but expansion of the interstate pipeline system in the Carolinas as we continue our strategic move from coal to gas. And then beyond that, for midstream or LDCs, there was a question earlier that address our interest in that. We will consider those types of additions to the portfolio that make sense, complement what we're trying to do. But our primary objective is closing the transaction, focusing our attention on integration, focusing our attention on growth organically as I outlined, and then other opportunities we'll evaluate as they arise. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got you. Thank you, guys. That's all I have. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hello. Good morning. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hello Ali. Bill Currens - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. Can you remind us for this year, the commercial power earnings that you've budgeted, how much of that is essentially coming from recognition of tax credits? Is it almost all of it? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : If you look in the slide deck, Ali, on slide 13, it gives you the full year assumption for commercial, and that business is commercial wind and solar, which as you know have tax credits as an important part of their economics. So, that gives you a range or a perspective on the magnitude of that contribution. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And Lynn, what is the mix between ITC and PTC recognition there? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : More heavily PTC, just because of the nature of our portfolio, Ali. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And what's current the average life of contracts on the PTC side? Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : On the PTC side, we look at PPAs that are in the range of typically 15 to 25 years, in that type of range. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And the PTC benefit, Ali, as you know is a 10-year benefit. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yes. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: And you are relatively early in that recognition, right, for most of the portfolio? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You know, certainly, we've been in the business, started modestly in 2007 and then you can look at our kind of capital contribution in growth 2012, 2013, 2014, so I would say early in that PTC period generally. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. And lastly, Lynn, I know when you provide us full-year guidance, you lay out what you're expecting adjusted ROEs to be across the portfolio as well. And in general, I mean would you say is there much in terms of, because looking at those numbers, it doesn't seem to be, but is there much in terms of regulatory lag that you would say exists in your portfolio that perhaps can be captured in future years or are you thinking generally speaking the ROEs will move when you file those rate cases in the back end of the five-year forecast? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Let me make a comment and then Steve can continue. Steve commented a moment ago, Ali, that we see the potential for rate cases in South Carolina in 2016 that's consistent with capital spending and cost structure and earned returns. And so we do have rate case potential in South Carolina in the very near term. And then later in the five-year period in North Carolina, that will be the result of regulatory lag showing up on capital investment that is occurring now and will occur into the future. I commented on trackers in Indiana and Florida, but at some point, we'll address updating those rates as well. So, I think regulatory lag for any jurisdiction where we have historic test periods or the need to use base rate increases to achieve prices is going to have some regulatory lag associated with it. And that's the careful analysis that we closely watch in determining the timing for filing. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And I would add, as we said in February, we had a slide on our five-year growth and we showed the lag was about 3% negative. And that's an average number over the five-year period. It will vary year per year. And it is as Lynn said related to the jurisdictions where you've got gaps between rate cases and you build up investments during those gap periods. So, we're working on that and planning around those events. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Ali. Operator : We'll take our next question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Congratulations again, Bill. Bill Currens - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Paul. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : I wanted to just sort of touch base on the storms. Is there a normal number for storm costs that we should be thinking about in this quarter? Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It is hard to predict storms obviously. The past three years we've seen winter storms that have hit us in the range of $50 million or $60 million a year, but whether that's normal or not, I would hesitate to say. We try to impute an amount that we think about in our budgeting, but you'll have during the summer season the potentials for hurricanes in the Southeast and then in the winter storms across our jurisdictions other than Florida, typically there's the potential. there. Hard to predict, but we've seen winter storms the past three years in the neighborhood of $50 million or $60 million. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. On slide 19, it looks like you guys are indicating that for the utilities, only about $0.01 was impacted by unfavorable weather. And I mean, is that solely because of it seems \u2013 it's a little surprisingly, it seems a little low. Does that take into account storm outages that might lower customer usage or, because when we look at slide eight, it looks like non-weather adjusted sales were down 4%, and I think that does not include leap year, correct? Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's correct. Yes. Let me give a little color on this. But typically, outages from storms do not affect volumes very significantly, as one point to make there, when you're looking at the whole breadth of things. I would say that the, I always want to say this, when you're looking at a quarter in particular, short periods of time, you have to be careful about weather normalized data. I think the first quarter of 2016 was mild, particularly March, and I don't know whether we pulled all of the weather impacts out appropriately in the first quarter of 2016. Correspondingly, the first quarter of 2015 was very, very cold. And I don't know whether all of the weather was pulled out of that quarter as well. So you're comparing these two weather normalized periods, and it shows that the weather impact may not have been that significant. I suspect that it may have been more mild than what we showed in the first quarter here, but I don't try to guess at what that could be. So we just roll with the data. I like to look at the 12 months rolling more critically there. We did as we acknowledged it, it was a bit of a soft quarter, but I think the 12-month rolling numbers are in line with what we've been forecasting. And I would want to emphasize that in response to a relatively weak load, we have aggressively pursued our cost structure to offset that. That's part of our long-term plans. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Okay. Great. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You know Paul, the only thing I would add to it is, we have standard methods of identifying what is weather related and non-weather related. And what Steve is commenting on is those standard methods can be impacted in periods where there is extreme temperature. So extreme cold or extreme warm weather that we experienced in March. So that all leads us to look at longer time periods, so that we don't have those anomalies that could exist in any quarter. And that is really what has led us to this 12-month rolling average discussion on load because we think that is more indicative of trends we're experiencing. And as you can imagine, we watch this really closely and manage the business for a low load growth environment. Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC : Excellent. Thanks a lot. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : And our final question will come from Andy Levi with Avon Capital. Please go ahead. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Hi. Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Andy. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Andy. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : How you guys doing? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well. Bill Currens - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yes, sir. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : You're one of the best ever, even though you never won that award, okay. I just want to say that. I would have given you that award. Bill Currens - Vice President- Investor Relations : You just gave it to us, so thank you. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Okay. But maybe next year Michael will win it, so. Actually I think most of my questions have been answered, but just back on the sales. So leap year is what, about 30 basis points on an annual basis, is that? Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's roughly right, Andy. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Right, so I guess for the quarter, you times up by four or something like that, or is that not the right math? Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah I think you could get in the ballpark there, and it's a little, that's a rough way to do it. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Right. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : But again, I think getting weather normalized data is as much art as science and when you get an extreme period like we had in March and comparing it to an extreme period like a prior year, I think you can get fluctuations that make that comparison a little distorted. We think our customer growth and volumes are in line with our broad prediction levels and we'll keep an eye on it. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : What do you guys think, I mean just in general, because it's not just you who are seeing like decent customer growth or weak sales trends and it's not just this quarter. Is it still energy efficiency or what else could it be? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : The other thing that we look at, Andy, is multifamily housing versus single family homes. We're starting to see some positive trends in the Carolinas where there are more single family home construction opportunities. But coming out of the economic downturn, a lot of the growth was in multifamily units, which by their footprint use less energy than a home. So, I think we're closely monitoring this and the call to the action for us is to ensure that our cost structure and the way we manage our investments and assets are consistent with the trends we're seeing at the top line. And we believe we have a demonstrated track record in managing our business that way. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Yeah. And then, just in general I guess, international is doing better than expected. Part of that is the tax benefit; part of that is hydro and then I would assume for the second half of the year, you'll have some tailwind from currency if things kind of stay where they are. So that's a positive for this year. But it also seems that the utility itself, because of the sales trends and I guess lack of rate increases, seems to be towards the low end of your range at this point. Again, it's early in the year, but is that a fair statement? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Andy, we're on target for the range of $450 million to $470 million that we talked to you about. This is the first quarter. I think to give you any more specifics on placement within the guidance range is just premature. As you know, the third quarter is our most significant quarter, and we're managing the business with identifying rate increase opportunities. Steve talked about South Carolina of course watching costs as part of that. And we'd like to see a longer trend on the sales growth to continue to monitor where that is progressing. So on track to achieve what we set out to achieve at the beginning of the year. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Okay. Thank you very much, and Bill, again congratulations. I think you'll be a great Controller and keep everyone in the straight and narrow, because I guess that's what a Controller does, and I'm sure your kids will be happy to spend more time with you than they have for the last few years. Bill Currens - Vice President- Investor Relations : All right. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Andy. Bill Currens - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Andy. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/ Millennium Partners : Yes. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Operator : With that being our last question, I'll turn the call back to Lynn Good for closing comments. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, Yolanda, thank you. And thanks everyone for hanging in with our fire alarm and our farewell to Bill Currens and welcome to Mike Callahan today. And most of all, thank you for your interest and investment in Duke. We look forward to meeting with many of you over the next several weeks and months and look forward to continue discussions. So, thanks again. Operator : That will conclude today's conference. Thank you all once again for your participation.",

Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Duke Energy Second Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Callahan. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Callahan - Vice President - Investor Relations, Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you, Anna. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's second quarter 2016 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO, along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide two presents the Safe Harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today's materials. Please note the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. As summarized on slide three, Lynn will cover our second quarter financial highlights and provide an update on our portfolio transition and strategic initiatives. Lynn will then provide an update on our coal ash efforts as well as other operational highlights. Then Steve will provide an overview of our second quarter financial results, an update on low growth trends and recent regulatory activity before closing with our key investor considerations. With that, I'll turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let me start on slide four and express how pleased I am with our financial results this quarter. This morning we announced second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $1.07, an increase of $0.12 from the prior year. We generated higher adjusted earnings with strong results at our regulated utilities, which gives us confidence to reaffirm our full year guidance for 2016. We also demonstrated our confidence in the strength of our core businesses with the recent increase in our dividend. We have consistently paid a dividend for 90 years, which extends our commitment to this key part of our total shareholder return proposition. We accomplished strong results this quarter while continuing to build our domestic energy infrastructure business as you can see on slide five. Let's start with our pending acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas. This acquisition and the expansion of our natural gas infrastructure platform supports our transition to a lower carbon future. In June, Duke Energy and Piedmont reached constructive settlement agreements with the North Carolina public staff and other key interveners. The settlement provide clear benefits to customers and communities. In July, the North Carolina Utilities Commission held a hearing to review the proposed acquisition. The acquisition review will be fully briefed on August 25, when proposed orders are due from all parties. There is no statutory timeframe for the commission to act and we won't speculate on their timing; however, integration efforts are going well and we will be opportunistic with our remaining acquisition financing such that we are prepared to close the transaction when all closing conditions are met. We remain confident of closing the transaction by the end of this year and possibly earlier. In addition, we're proceeding as planned with our process to access the Latin American generation business. We've received strong interest from a variety of parties. We have since invited a select group of bidders to participate in detailed due diligence, including management presentations and site visits for the purpose of providing final bids. We will continue to provide updates as we move through this process. Turning to slide six, I'll provide you with a brief update on our progress executing our $30 billion strategic growth capital plan. Our vision is to invest capital in smarter energy solutions that generate cleaner energy and modernize the grid, creating value for our customers and delivering earnings and dividend growth for our shareholders. Our major generation projects continue to move forward as planned remaining on time and on budget. In South Carolina, construction of our $600 million Lee natural gas combined cycle plant is progressing well toward a November 2017 in-service date. In Florida, construction has begun on our $1.5 billion Citrus County combined cycle plant. And our up rates at Hines are on target for an October 1 in-service date. In addition, we continue to add solar to our regulated generation portfolio. In May, the NCUC approved two new solar projects totaling 65 megawatts in our Duke Energy Carolina service territory. Both of these projects are expected to be online in the first quarter of 2017. In Indiana, the State Regulatory Commission approved our 17-megawatt solar plant at the Crane Naval Station, the second-largest solar power plant in the state. Per Indiana statute, we will recover 100% of the cost of the project via a clean energy investment rider. We also had several positive developments regarding our grid modernization efforts. On June 29, the Indiana Commission approved our previously filed settlement agreement for our seven-year, $1.4 billion plan to build a smarter energy infrastructure, which is now under way. In Kentucky, we filed a request to deploy smart meters in our service territory; while in South Carolina, we received an accounting order from the commission allowing Duke Energy Carolinas to defer the cost of smart meter investments until the next rate case. These programs will provide much needed technology and infrastructure upgrades. They build upon our progress in investing in the energy grid and will benefit customers with improved reliability and safety, fewer and shorter power outages and overall energy savings. Shifting to our commercial portfolio, we continue to advance our two natural gas pipeline projects, Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Sabal Trail. We expect to receive FERC's notice of schedule for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline soon. We still anticipate a FERC order allowing construction to begin by mid-2017, keeping the project on target for a late 2018 in-service date. Meanwhile, you might recall that Sabal Trail received FERC approval in February of this year. Pre-construction work is underway with construction expected to begin in late summer. The project remains on target to be in operation in mid-2017. We also had success this quarter growing our commercial renewable fleet. Our 200-megawatt Los Vientos IV wind project achieved commercial operation in July, a month ahead of schedule. Our 200-megawatt Frontier wind project remains on target to begin serving customers later this year. With the acquisition of 55 megawatts of new solar projects, we now have two additional projects in North Carolina and our first in New Mexico. By year-end, we expect commercial renewables footprint to be approximately 3,000 megawatts. Turning to slide seven, let me update you on the significant progress we made during the quarter on coal ash basin closure. As we have previously discussed, our work is underway to close basins at seven sites in the Carolinas, including two sites in South Carolina. For our remaining North Carolina basins, in the second quarter we received updated rankings from the North Carolina Department of Environmental quality. The rankings established closure methods, time frames, and ultimately cost. They also highlighted the need for additional time to complete ongoing dam improvement activities and collect additional scientific and engineering data to appropriately rank and safely close the basin. In response, North Carolina adopted House Bill 630 to strengthen the 2014 Coal Ash Management Act. The legislation provides important clarifications, keeping final authority for coal ash oversight with the state environmental regulator and outlining a path to low classifications for many of our basins, which allows for a range of closure options, including capping the material in place. It also requires the completion of the dam improvement activities and providing access to a permanent alternative drinking water supply for certain residents. This removes any concerns for plant neighbors about potential impact to their surrounding private drinking wells. In addition, the legislation directs the construction of ash reprocessing facilities at three sites to make the material suitable for use in concrete. We support recycling ash, which is the only way to avoid permanent storage of this useful construction material. The time frames outlined in the new legislation are generally consistent with the requirements of the federal Coal Combustion Residual or CCR rule and work is underway to meet the requirements in the CCR rule and the North Carolina legislation. The new law in North Carolina does not materially affect our current estimated costs for basin closure and we remain committed to safe sustainable long-term solutions for coal ash across all of our jurisdictions. Moving to Indiana, we filed testimony in June to support our first petition to recover approximately $400 million in costs associated with the federal CCR rule. Our petition requests that these costs for dry bottom ash conversion projects be recovered under the Indiana Federal Mandate Statute. This statute provides for 80% recovery of project costs through a rider and 20% deferred until the next rate case. Hearings are scheduled for November, and we could receive an order by mid-2017. Finally, in July we filed a request in Kentucky for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to construct a $23 million dry bottom ash handling system at our East Bend station. Before I turn it over to Steve, I'd like to highlight on slide eight several of our recent operational accomplishments made possible by the dedication of our employees. Our strong generation fleet performance has persisted through the second quarter. Year-to-date, our nuclear fleet has achieved a 96% capacity factor. At Oconee Unit 3 in the Carolinas our team set a new record for shortest outage time, an improvement of 10% over the prior period. In June, the company was recognized by EEI with the association's Emergency Recovery Award for our outstanding power restoration efforts in the Carolinas following Winter Storm Jonas earlier this year. These efforts were again on display in response to the approximately 550,000 outages caused by Tropical Storm Colin in Florida in June and powerful windstorms in the Midwest and Carolinas in June and early July. In each of these storms, our teams worked diligently and safely both day and night to restore service as quickly as possible, and I commend their commitment to meeting our customers' needs 24 by 7. Also in June we exceeded the $687 million guarantee fuel and joint dispatch merger savings, providing a significant benefit to our Carolinas customers as a result of the 2012 Duke and Progress Energy merger. The dedicated efforts of our teams allowed us to complete this important milestone, a full year ahead of our original commitment. In conclusion, I'm pleased with our financial results for the quarter and our progress in advancing our strategic initiatives as we invest in cleaner and smarter energy solutions for our customers and deliver growth for our investors. We are maintaining a sharp focus on operational excellence, which includes our commitment to safety and cost efficiency. Our portfolio transition enhances Duke's position as an industry-leading domestic infrastructure business with stable transparent earnings and cash flows. We look forward to completing this transition. Now let me turn it over to Steve. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Lynn. As Lynn mentioned, we are pleased with our strong quarter. Given the results through the first half of the year, we remain on track to achieve and today have reaffirmed our full-year 2016 guidance range of between $4.50 to $4.70 per share. Let me walk you through some of the key drivers from the quarter as well as provide updates on current retail volume trends within our service territories and regulatory activity underway in our jurisdictions. I'll start with the quarterly results on slide nine. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year and a reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. On a reported or GAAP basis, 2016 second quarter earnings per share were $0.74 compared to $0.78 last year and were impacted by an impairment in Central America. Due to the continued advancement of our process to exit the Latin American generation business and the increased probability of sale, we evaluated the carrying value of the asset groups within International Energy. We determined that certain assets in Central America were impaired and as a result we recognized a pre-tax charge of $194 million. In addition to this impairment, costs related to mergers and savings initiatives were also special items that have been excluded from our adjusted EPS results. Let me now discuss our adjusted quarterly earnings and key drivers at each of our business segments. Second quarter adjusted diluted earnings were $1.07 per share compared to $0.95 in the second quarter of 2015. Regulated Utilities quarterly adjusted results increased by $0.13 per share despite less favorable weather. This was primarily driven by higher pricing and riders. We also realized higher wholesale margins, primarily due to the long-term contract associated with the NCEMPA acquisition in the prior year. In addition, reduced outage costs and ongoing cost management efforts enabled us to further reduce our O&M in the quarter. Even with $0.06 in higher storm related costs year-to-date, our focus on operational efficiencies and cost savings initiatives position us to achieve our full-year O&M reduction target and helps position us to maintain a flat O&M cost structure through 2020. Commercial Portfolio results increased by $0.01 per share in the second quarter. The higher results were largely driven by increased investments in our share of the Atlantic Coast and Sabal Trail pipelines. Our renewables portfolio was flat compared to the prior-year quarter as weaker than expected wind resources were lower than historical averages, a trend similar to last year. On a year-to-date basis, our commercial portfolio was slightly behind our original expectations for the first half of the year. We will continue to monitor this trend throughout the remainder of the year. Moving on, other was flat for the quarter as a favorable income tax adjustment resulting from a completed IRS audit was offset by higher interest expense. International's quarterly earnings declined by $0.02 over last year. Lower earnings at National Methanol were driven by the completion of planned maintenance and lower MTBE prices. Looking ahead, the expansion of the new palm facility at National Methanol has been delayed and is now expected to come on line in the second quarter of 2017. As a reminder, once in service this expansion will reduce our ownership percentage from 25% to 17.5%. International's results were also impacted by higher income tax expense. Because of our announcement in early 2016 of our intent to exit our Latin American operations, we no longer expect to permanently reinvest earnings in that business. As a result, we will continue to recognize additional U.S. income taxes up to the point of sale. Stronger results in Brazil due to improved hydrology more then offset weaker foreign currency exchange rates. Overall, it was a solid quarter and we are pleased with our results. Moving on to slide 10, let's review our retail customer volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather-normalized retail load growth was 0.3% through the second quarter and continues to track our long-term expectations of approximately 0.5% load growth. We are particularly pleased with the strength of our residential volume trends, which continue to grow at 0.8% over the last 12 months. Growth has been bolstered by a 1.4% increase in the number of customers. This has more than compensated for the usage reduction by our residential customers due to their increased adoption of energy efficiency and general housing trends. For the first time since the recession, we are beginning to witness single-family housing starts reaching the level of multi-family starts. At a macro level, employment and wage growth were also trending favorably for the residential class. Moving to the commercial class, we experienced a decline of 0.2% over the rolling 12 months. Commercial continues to grow in our Carolinas and Florida jurisdictions, led by gains in non-manufacturing employment and declining office vacancies; however, in the Midwest, we see continued declines in the government sector related to the impacts of budget cuts. In our industrial class, we continue to see growth of 0.4% on a rolling 12-month basis. Industries that support construction and automotives remain strong, and we are seeing positive signs once again in the chemicals, rubber and plastics industries. A few large industrial customers in the Midwest completed production outages during the quarter, which we believe temporarily impacted growth. Meanwhile the softer global economy and strength of the U.S. dollar are still impacting companies influenced by exports. Of note, this quarter, we saw a renewed strength in sales in the metals sector. In particular, Indiana showed growth in this sector as tariffs on imports have resulted in increased domestic metal production that is critical to the Midwest industrial base. We will continue to closely monitor economic conditions and our customer usage patterns throughout the remainder of the year. Moving to slide 11, the company recently submitted regulatory filings in South Carolina and Florida. On July 1, we filed a request with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina to increase revenues by about $79 million for Duke Energy progress, our first rate case in this jurisdiction since 1988. We've made significant investments to build new energy infrastructure to meet the needs of a growing customer base and comply with environmental regulations at both the state and federal levels. These investments allow us to provide affordable, reliable and increasingly cleaner energy to customers. They are key drivers for the proposed increase, which will allow us to recover the costs associated with assets we have placed into service in recent years. These include our H.F. Lee, Smith, and Sutton natural gas fired combined cycle facilities. They also include the South Carolina retail share of costs from the NCEMPA acquisition, in addition to renewables investments. The hearing will begin on October 31 and, if approved, new rates could go into effect in January 2017. We have also filed two separate petitions with the Florida Public Service Commission under the generation base rate adjustment mechanism to increase revenues by approximately $70 million. The first petition includes the Hines Energy inlet chilling air units, which will provide approximately 220 megawatts of additional capacity to the current plant. The second petition is filed to recover the total revenue requirements associated with the previously approved acquisition of the Osprey generating facility from Calpine. We expect this acquisition to be completed in early 2017. Also in Florida, I am pleased to announce that we recently completed the securitization of cost associated with our retired Crystal River 3 nuclear plant. By issuing bonds at very attractive interest rates, this transaction will save our Florida customers nearly $800 million over the next 20 years. This financing represents a win-win solution that allows us to continue making investments in Florida that provide cleaner energy solutions for our customers and at the same time, help manage the impact to our customer's bills. I'm proud of our team that worked diligently to create significant value for our customers through this transaction. I'll close with slide 12. Duke Energy has tremendous scale, offering an attractive investor value proposition which includes balanced growth in earnings and reliable dividends over time. As Lynn mentioned, we are making good progress on the exit of the Latin American generation business in preparing for the integration of Piedmont. After completion of these strategic transactions, we will operate a portfolio that provides low risk and high-quality earnings and cash flows to support stable earnings and dividend growth. We are making significant strides in executing on our capital plan, including investing in cleaner energy resources and technologies that modernize our energy grid to provide the enhanced services that our customers expect. And we are excited about the growth opportunities for natural gas infrastructure across our service territories, particularly in the Southeast. Our dividend is very important to us. The strength of cash flows generated by our operating companies allows us to continue to target annual growth in the dividend consistent with our long-term 4% to 6% earnings growth objective. We had a good first half of the year and are looking ahead to the third quarter, traditionally our strongest. This gives us confidence to reaffirm our $4.50 to $4.70 adjusted earnings per share guidance range for 2016. With that, let's open the lines for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll move first to Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: On the Latin America sale, can you give us any update on just when you would anticipate this wrapping up? I think you're saying it's \u2013 you've gone into the second round already. Is this a this quarter or more a fourth quarter type of thing? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You know, Jonathan, it's progressing as we expected. We are targeting an announcement by the end of the year and believe closing is a 2017 event. So we will give more specifics as we continue through the process. But we're on pace to achieve that at this point. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then just on the same topic, I think on the last call you had said that you would sort of give some updated thoughts around likely dilution as the year progressed. And given that we've seen an improvement, I guess, in the fundamentals and some other aspects, do you have anything new to say on that or should we sort of stick with the prior commentary? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think the prior commentary still works, Jonathan. I think until we can talk more specifics on the price and the timing, it's difficult to be more specific at this point. So we will provide that information when we have clarity and give you the kind of update you'd expect on implications to long-term earnings trajectory. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Is it fair to say that you might feel better than you did three months ago, given changes in the marketplace? Or is that just ... Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, I certainly \u2013 yeah, I think your observations of optimism. We see stronger GDP growth being projected for 2017 working through some of the political issues seems to be moving forward. Of course, the hydrology has returned to normal so there are a number of positive trends. And you all watch FX, that's trended favorably as well. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: But you're definitely selling, right? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We're definitely selling. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Jonathan. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Stephen. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Morning, Stephen. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Wanted to just check in with you on coal ash spend and recovery. I know this is a topic you've talked about in the past but I just wanted to make sure I understood your latest thinking from here in terms of approach to recovery of spending, any additional thoughts you might have in terms of just strategy for addressing that spend? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Stephen, the forecast that we have in place at this point has about $1.3 billion of coal ash spend over the next several years, really targeted to the first four sites. And we think that's a good planning assumption for now. We have requested deferral of those costs in South Carolina and we've received approval, and we will be pursuing recovery of cost in South Carolina in connection with the case that we just filed. For North Carolina, we intend to file a case really in connection with in-service date of certain of the plants. So we gave you an update on our timing on that and coal ash would be a part of that general rate case process. I'm pleased with what we've accomplished so far, both in terms of the progress we've made in basin closure. And I believe the legislation that's in place today has also reduced any uncertainty, or a lot of the uncertainty, around the cost estimate and closure methods, which I also think is important. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, that's very helpful. And shifting to kind of the other side of the spectrum on solar, I guess two parts to this. One, we've been hearing a whole bunch of encouraging commentary from other utilities in terms of just potential for increased solar growth. So I was curious in terms of your take on that potential. And relatedly, in terms of your organic growth capabilities in terms of your team and being able to grow this business yourself rather than simply acquire other mature assets, if you could just speak to your capabilities. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Stephen, we have had a separate dedicated team focused on renewable growth since 2007. We call it our commercial renewables team. So we have about 3,000 megawatts of a combination of wind and solar. Some of it has been greenfield-developed; some of it has been acquired. And we've been in the business of not only building, constructing, operating but also acquiring assets for a long period of time. We continue to put capital to work in a disciplined way in that business. The returns are heavily impacted by tax incentives. And so ensuring that we're delivering an appropriate return is always an area of focus in that business. Over the last three years we've turned greater attention to regulated renewables and have made a number of solar investments in the Carolinas. We announced one in Indiana and we've had a number in Florida as well. And that team has delivered probably between 250 and 300 megawatts of owned renewables in all of our jurisdictions. We believe that's going to be increasingly important as we go forward. So there's been a lot of development in both areas of our business over the last several years. And I believe we have a strong team to continue to pursue growth in those areas. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. And, Lynn, in terms of the potential for gross step change up in terms of greater solar growth, just as the cost of solar continues to drop very rapidly, should we expect a step change or do you see it as more of a gradual evolution where you're focused? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You know, and I think, Stephen, I would talk about it in a couple of ways. In the regulated area, each jurisdiction has a slightly different profile. We have renewable standards in some. We have solar legislation in some. In Florida, we have a site plan that has 500 megawatts under development over the next 10 years. And we are constantly looking for what is the lowest cost resource that we can bring in that makes sense for customers and really use that as part of a planning assumption for our integrated resources. So we will see that continue to build. I wouldn't see it as a step change, necessarily, but continued growth consistent with what makes sense for customers. On the commercial side, we have a combination of wind and solar. Our portfolio today is more heavily allocated to wind. And we look for opportunistic opportunities to bring assets into the portfolio that make sense given our return expectations. So if you look at our capital plan, you see $500 million to $1 billion of annual spend looking for the right opportunities. And that's a good planning assumption, again, to think about how we are adding renewables to our portfolio. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Good morning, Lynn. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hello, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Couple of questions related to international sale \u2013 just the assumptions kind of on the edges. What was the debt level there at the end of the quarter? I had it last time around $650 million. Is that still about right? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : That's a good assumption. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's about right, yeah. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And you still expect that you will not have to pay any taxes on a sale \u2013 cash taxes? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Because of the NOL position, Steve, it's pushed out. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then is there anything you need to deal with in terms of overheads within the whole company that are being attributed there that might have to be placed to the rest of the company? Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, I think we're in pretty good shape there. We have a Houston office that deals with the international business, and so it's a bit more stand-alone than some of our other operations. So I think we're well prepared to deal with that. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You know, Steve, I would add to that. In each country we run a finance organization. There's a CFO, there are HR execs, there are legal support in each country. And then we also have, as Steve indicated, a Houston office that serves as overall oversight. So there are resources here at the corporate center that support international but it's not to the extent that you might expect for a more domestic business. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then unrelated question, just I think, Steve, you mentioned something about commercial maybe tracking a little bit below plan so far this year. But then I assume the utilities may be a little above. Could you just kind of clarify what you're saying there? What are \u2013 if that's true, what are the key drivers on each -below or above? Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Right. Yeah, let me talk about some of our segments here. Commercial is running a bit below. We've had below-normal wind, if you will, and that's pushed some of the earnings down there. We'll see what happens in the last half of the year. International had a large favorable tax item that we booked in Q1. Some of that will come back over the remainder of the year. But that's been helpful to their results certainly for us. On the regulated side, we started out the year with mild weather and storms and some weak weather-normal volumes. We've done a great job in the second quarter of coming back. Weather has picked up a bit in June and certainly in July. We'll see where that goes through the third quarter. Our O&M savings have been quite significant. Year-to-date, $0.10 savings; that's been offset by about $0.06 of storm but still some very strong year-to-date O&M savings that help us there. We've gotten good top-line revenue growth from energy efficiency riders and some infrastructure riders in the Midwest. That has helped and continues there. We'll see how weather-normal load picks up in the second half. We're optimistic about the residential side of things. So there's ups and downs in the various segments there but feel good about where we're headed for the rest of the year. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : And we'll move next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, actually just to pick up on the last question to kick it off. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Well, good morning, first off. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Perhaps if you could \u2013 good morning. I wanted to follow up here on the commercial renewables, if you will. What is a good rule of thumb when you're thinking about wind or solar as you build those out and make the year-over-year comparisons? I know that you've had these pressures but what are the rules of thumb? What is 100 megawatts, what's a gigawatt equal on an EPS basis? Again, you've obviously got the one-time ITC element here but just kind of an ongoing basis. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Julien, that's an interesting metric. The way we look at these projects is overall return over the life of the project with an expectation that the return has to clear hurdle rates around cost to capital and other things. So we don't look at it as a specific metric of revenue or EBIT per megawatt hour, whether it's wind or solar. The profile, as you indicated, is different. So the ITC impact of solar for the commercial can have a more heavily weighted near-term impact. Wind comes in over the 10-year PTC period. What's influencing results for us in the first half is just the wind not blowing as much, so we had relatively weaker wind in the quarter relative to plan. But it's really consistent with what we saw last year with weaker wind, so not much of a year-over-year delta. Hopefully, that clarifies. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Yes, absolutely. And then if you can expand on your strategic vision for the company. Obviously, we've seen other peers in the Southeast look at Midstream a lot more closely. Obviously, you guys have more of a history. Can you give us your latest thinking on the trajectory? Is gas utility it or are you going to go further? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Julien, if you look at the investments we've made over the last three years, we have been turning more attention to gas infrastructure. And that is really building on the transition in our generation portfolio toward more natural gas. So if you go back to 2008, 2009, 2010, the Carolina companies had very little generation coming from natural gas. That, today, is in the range of 25% to 30% of our energy is coming from natural gas. So we made an investment in the Atlantic Coast pipeline, $2 billion investment, to bring more infrastructure into the state to provide infrastructure for further development of generation and also services to customers. We made an investment in Sabal Trail, which is important to Florida, which is already a very gas-heavy area. And then we added Piedmont, which is the interstate pipeline in the Carolinas, which we believe has great growth opportunity, not only for the customers they serve, but for increasing power generation. So we believe that gas infrastructure fits with Duke. The returns, the regulated returns, the cash flows in support of our dividend are important. And we will look for ways to continue to add to that portfolio as we go forward. At the same time, as you know, we are also adding to our electric business with grid investment, renewables, gas generation. And we'll continue with those investments as well. Always looking for ways we can add additional value to customers and to our investors. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. And a quick clarification on a prior question. When you were talking about recovery mechanism for coal ash and the timeline in turn for rate cases, can you elaborate a little bit on your confidence of the 4% to 6% and when that's going to materialize as it relates to the latest clarity in coal ash recovery and, in turn, the clarity that you're now getting for your rate case timeline? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Julien, we're on track for 4% to 6% as we've talked about, really over this year. The rate cases will be more in the back half of the five-year period. So you should be thinking about greater contribution in 2018 and 2019 than in 2017, as an example. I think what the coal ash legislation does is it provides more certainty on our larger sites, on the methods that we can use to close. And therefore, the overall cost and impact to customers will be lower over the 10- to 15-year period that we pursue closure of these basins. So I think it's all fitting together in what we have shared with you as our approach to delivering the 4% to 6% over the five-year period. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Great, thank you. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Shar. Good morning. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Shar. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : So most of the questions were answered. Just real quick on Atlantic Coast Pipeline. I think that it's obviously now fully subscribed. So is there sort of a viewpoint on when and if you would look to upsize it to around 2 BCF of laterals and compressors? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Shar, we need to get through the FERC process for the existing status or investment of the pipeline. We expect to receive a scheduling order soon and anticipate the FERC order in 2017. So I think discussions about the future around that pipeline will be better served 2017, 2018 as we continue to progress the existing project. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it. And then just lastly on the solar, as we sort of think about your pipeline and your backlog and installations, how should we sort of think about the solar versus at the regulated utility, regulated rates or at the commercial business? As you look to do more solar. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So at this point in the regulated business, Shar, it's almost all solar. You should think about the Carolinas renewables investments as being solar investments. We have one wind investment in Indiana and there could be potential for more wind in the Midwest. But I would think about our regulated potential as being primarily a solar potential. As we think about commercial, we look at both. And, in fact, this year we're going to install more megawatts of wind than solar, just based on the opportunistic nature of what we've developed, the returns we've delivered and what we believe to be the highest quality projects. So we'll be more opportunistic in the commercial business looking at a complement of wind and solar. We like the profile of PTC. So there might be a slight bias toward wind. But in our regulated business, as I said, solar will be the predominant investment type. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it. And then do you expect that mix between wind and solar commercial to potentially invert as the PTCs roll off? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We always look at that, Shar, and what makes the most sense for the business. Where do we have the greatest return potential? We are heavily weighted to wind. We've probably put more attention to solar in 2014 and 2015 and so we continue to look at a mix. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Excellent. Thanks so much. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, guys. Can you just talk about pension for a second? Just trying to think about what your sensitivity is to changes in discount rates and interest rates and how that may impact O&M and which jurisdictions do you get kind of more real-time recovery of that increased cost versus which ones where there's a little bit of lag? Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Michael. A sensitivity first : 25 bps on our discount rate is about $0.02 up or down on our pension expense. And it's a similar sensitivity on the return on assets of a 25 bps change on the return on the fund assets. A couple of things about our pension plan, it's fully funded, over 100% funded. And it's a closed pension plan. And we have de-risks that -- we're in the process of de-risking it. And so we're not quite as volatile as maybe some folks might be regarding swings there. Most of our jurisdictions have that as part of cost of service in our service territory. So you update pension cost like you do other non-fuel O&M type costs. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. One other question, a little bit of a change of topic, but when you look at demand across your different service territories, the demand trends look very different near Southern service territories versus those in the Midwest. Can you talk a little bit about how having those very different kind of demand trajectories impacts how you might think about managing those different jurisdictions differently? Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Michael. You certainly do see different characteristics across our service territories, which is one of the benefits of that type of diversity. When you look at the Midwest, you'll see less residential population growth than the Southeast. But you do see some very solid industrial growth. When you look over the past several years, we've seen a lot of the automotive and metals in the Midwest kind of carry our growth during 2012 through 2015. What we're seeing now is that the residential growth in the Southeast is picking up as some of our industrial growth has declined a bit. But we have jurisdictional leadership that is very well attuned to the business climates in all of our jurisdictions. And they do vary. Florida has little industrial and has a lot of residential. The Midwest has a lot of industrial, so we're well in tune and manage all of those jurisdictions accordingly. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Michael, what I would add is each jurisdiction has its own business profile challenges and opportunities as well as the public policies in each state can impact the way we think about our priorities. And so I think about the Carolinas with the focus on renewable portfolio standards and the increased interest in solar in South Carolina. We are taking advantage of that interest and making investments in that way. In Indiana, it's been a jurisdiction that has very much been interested in infrastructure investment. The support for the grid investment of $1.5 billion has been something that moved through the legislature and then we've been able to put a plan in front of the Indiana Commission that they have approved. And so the point you're making about tailoring what we do, both in terms of regulatory strategy and legislative strategy to each state, is something that our jurisdictional teams are focused on. And I think that's one of the strengths of our portfolio is we have the opportunity to take advantage of the interests in each state. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you for that. One \u2013 I guess one final, in the Carolinas, in North Carolina, have you all quantified what the coal ash expected capital spending costs are for the next few years and then kind of what the total obligation or liability is longer term? Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : What we have disclosed, Michael, in our five-year plan, we had disclosed $1.3 billion of CapEx related to the four sites that we knew we were going to excavate. And then beyond that, we had disclosed that we had between $0.7 billion and $1 billion for some other sites that we had disclosed we were going to excavate. Some of that spend gets outside the five-year window. So we'll update those numbers in February. Those are kind of the disclosures that we had. I don't know that they've changed dramatically. The overall ARO obligation on our books for the Carolinas and North Carolina is about $4 billion. That hasn't changed a lot over the past several quarters. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Lynn. Much appreciated. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Brian Chin with Bank of America. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Brian. Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. Just a general industry question. We've heard from a number of your peers that are investing in wind and solar that because of the improvement in technology and economies of scale that PPA prices are now economical at lower and lower levels. Could you give just a general sense of what your commercial team is seeing with regards to PPA prices for wind and solar? And what's your general take on to what extent do you agree with that statement versus does the industry \u2013 is the industry experiencing a little bit of a capital discipline issue here? Can you just comment on that generally? Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Brian, the prices are lower. PPA prices are declining. I think that reflects the improvement in the technology. And the comment that I would make, the economics are still largely, largely driven by tax incentives. And so an important criteria in establishing returns is your ability to monetize those tax credits, either through a tax equity structure or through your own profile. And so that's something that we look closely at. I think we've disclosed that we are in an NOL position. And so our appetite for immediate monetization is limited. And so I think there are a variety of considerations as we look at additional investment and what discipline means for Duke Energy in the returns that we're trying to deliver with renewables. Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. And then one other question. You made it very clear at the beginning of the year that the National Methanol group was not part of the international sale effort. Can you comment on are there any conditions that might occur in the future that might prompt you to revisit that? And what is the investment case for owning National Methanol? I understand that you have a very complex relationship with the government of Saudi Arabia in terms of an ownership structure. But from just purely an investment standpoint, what is the case for continuing to own that business? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Brian, I'll maybe give you a little perspective on history on this. We had the opportunity to renegotiate the NMC contract. My, what has it been? 2011, 2012? Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Where we extended the life of the contract in exchange for a reduction in ownership because we were not going to put additional investment dollars into the joint venture. And we ended up with a very attractive net present value on that investment where you get another 15 years or so of earnings with no additional capital investment. And we thought that was a prudent thing to do because the value of selling it at that point of renegotiation was inferior to the extension profile. And so at any point, I guess we could enter into discussions with our partners about an exit. But I look at it today as being a very small investment that produces strong cash flows that we're able to bring in and use to support the dividend. And in the scheme of all of Duke, it's relatively modest. Right? We're talking about less than $100 million of net income. So that's the history I would share with you and it's been a good contributor over time, as you know. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, I would add that it's an investment on our books of less than $100 million that produces net income, cash dividended to the parent of, in some years, close to $100 million a year. It's lower than that, but still very profitable at the lower levels. So it is an equity investment; doesn't require a lot of management time or effort. Selling it has some challenges. So we'll hold on to it. Brian J. Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you, and best of luck as you complete the international asset sale. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Brian. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Michael Weinstein (51:59) with Credit Suisse. Unknown Speaker : Hi. Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Hello, Michael (51:48). Unknown Speaker : Good morning. A lot of my questions have been answered. But just to follow up a little bit on coal ash, would you remind us how much has actually been spent to date so far versus the total plan, and is that the amount that you expect to file in your next North Carolina rate case? Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We've spent roughly $500 million to date, and we'll be spending at accelerated clips as we go forward. So we'll be determining what \u2013 based upon levels of prior spend, that will impact our filing criteria. Typically, we would not try to recover costs that have not yet been spent. So that's why you build up a spend pattern a little bit and then make recovery applications there. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think, Michael, it's important, when we talk about $500 million, in the Carolinas, we operate four utilities. So it's North Carolina \u2013 Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress; South Carolina \u2013 Duke Energy Carolina, Duke Energy Progress. So that spend would be included in four different sets of rate cases as we go forward. Unknown Speaker : All right. That makes sense. And I know that you said earlier that the tax \u2013 that you don't expect any kind of, I guess, gains tax on the sale of the Brazilian portfolio? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So we're in an NOL position on our federal tax basis is what we were talking about. And so cash taxes \u2013 if there are cash taxes to be paid \u2013 will be deferred into the future. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, we... Unknown Speaker : Yeah. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, we would suspect that we would have a taxable gain on the sale. But the level of taxes recognized depends upon the sales price and so forth and various tax mechanisms put in place. But whatever tax liability we get from that will be deferred due to the NOL positioning. Unknown Speaker : Have you disclosed the tax basis? Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, we have not. Unknown Speaker : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. Operator : And we'll now take our next question from Praful Mehta with Citi. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Just one question on \u2013 we've talked a lot about your portfolio about for commercial, natural gas, putting the 4% to 6% growth rate that you have in context, how would you look at these different pieces of the business? As in what's driving \u2013 what's kind of delivering higher growth in the 4% to 6%, what is lower? And as you look forward, how do you look at your portfolio? I mean, what do you look to grow? What do you think will deliver that stronger growth more post the four- to five-year timeframe as well? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I would point back to the slide that we included in our February call that laid out the components of the growth. Certainly the utilities, the regulated utilities are an important part of that. And it's a combination of wholesale growth, investment growth and modest load growth. Our commercial business will contribute. Piedmont and the gas platform will contribute. We see Piedmont as growing at a faster rate than 4% to 6% and the pipeline investment will be growing at a slightly faster rate. So I would refer you back to that slide. I think it's the \u2013 probably the best depiction of the details around how the 4% to 6% unfolds over the next five years. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got you. And do you see that trend happening more past that five-year trend as well? As in, do you see utility growth tapering off a little bit and that Piedmont picks up on that growth over time? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : You know, I think we continue to look for ways that we can deliver investment for customers in our electric business. I think the one thing I would point out, if you look at the profile of Duke over the last 5 to 10 years, our growth has been more heavily weighted toward generation, which means we continue to have a lot of potential in distribution, grid, transmission and customer, that we'll continue to find opportunities to put capital to work over the next five years. But I believe that trend will continue into the future. Renewables are another area that I think will continue beyond the five-year period. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Right. I would add that we see our regulated rate base growing at 5% over our five-year timeframe. And ultimately, that's a way to think about an earnings base. And now the timing can vary depending on rate case timing but that's the earnings based growth we see. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got you. Thanks so much, guys. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Ali. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning, Lynn and Steve. First question \u2013 just so that we don't double count these numbers, can you just remind us in the base case scenario, how much cash had you assumed you would be taking out from international on a going forward basis? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : About $300 million a year. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's correct. And thus far we've taken back about $1.5 billion through the repatriation effort that we put together in late 2014. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. But that $300 million a year, was that indefinite or was that over some period of years? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So, Ali, you might remember we declared a $2.7 billion dividend. The $1.5 billion that Steve indicated has already moved against that dividend. So we had $1.2 billion left, and I believe we were targeting to move that between now and 2021 or something like that. So it was not \u2013 what we had accomplished was a very favorable structure transaction that gave us an opportunity to move $2.7 billion in an advantaged way. And we were going to move the $300 million a year against that between now and 2021. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. And just to be clear, Lynn, correct me if I'm wrong, so when we think about the proceeds that you'll get from the international sales, it's the stuff or cash that's above $1.2 billion that we should think of as incremental cash that you would not have counted on in your base case original plan. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Certainly accelerated \u2013 an accelerated $1.2 billion. Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Right. It accelerates it and would be greater than $1.2 billion. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Right, right. And then separately, with the write-off, I know you alluded to that in your opening remarks, what is the book value of those international assets now? Steven K. Young - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : They are in the neighborhood of $2.4 billion, $2.5 billion. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Okay. And last question, the 4% to 6% growth longer term, can you remind us the underlying load growth weather-normalized, is that 0.5% have you assumed that stays consistent over that period or just remind us what you assumed there? Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : 0.5%. You have a good memory. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Thanks so much. Operator : And it appears there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Good for any additional or closing remarks. Lynn J. Good - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So I want to thank you all for your interest in investment in Duke Energy. We look forward to continuing to provide updates on all of these matters as we go forward. And, of course, the IR team is available today for any follow-up questions. So thanks again. Operator : Once again, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Callahan. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Callahan : Thank you, Rachael. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Duke Energy's third quarter 2016 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO, along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the Safe Harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today's materials. Please note the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. As summarized on Slide 3, Lynn will cover the key milestones we reached in the quarter as we near the completion of our portfolio transition and provide a brief overview of our new business segments. She will also discuss our third quarter financial and operational highlights and provide an update on our growth initiatives. Steve will then provide an overview of our third quarter financial results, and lower growth trends as well as an update on regulatory activity. He will also provide insight into our expectations for 2017 before closing before closing with our key investor considerations. With that, I'll turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We have a strong third quarter at Duke Energy. Delivering very solid financial results and demonstrating significant progress in the execution of our business portfolio transition. We closed the Piedmont Natural Gas acquisition and we also announce the sale of our Latin American assets. This transition of our business portfolio strengthens our franchise of high quality stable and growing energy infrastructure businesses.  Starting on Slide 4, let me begin with our business portfolio transition. On October 3rd, we closed the Piedmont Natural Gas acquisition following approval by the North Carolina Utilities Commission. We\u2019re delighted to bring Piedmont's industry leading expertise into our company as we expand our natural gas platform. Supporting our transition to a lower carbon future and growing investments and important natural gas infrastructure. We've worked with and admired Piedmont for many years and our post-closing integration efforts are well underway. In addition on October 10th, we announced agreements with the China Three Gorges Corporation and I Squared Capital to sell our Latin American generation assets. China Three Gorges will buy our assets in Brazil for approximately $1.2 billion including the assumption of debt. We expect to complete the transaction in 2 to 4 months once we\u2019ve received required approvals in Brazil and China. We\u2019re making good progress.  In fact to this morning the Brazilian anti-trust agency preliminarily approved the transactions without any restrictions. This begins a 15 day statutory objection period and if no objections are filed the approval will become final. I Squared Capital will buy our remaining assets in South and Central America in a separate transaction also valued at approximately $1.2 billion. We expect to close this transaction within the next three to five months. The proceeds available will be used to reduce Duke Energy Holding Company debt. Steve will discuss additional implications from the transaction in a moment.  Both of these announcements demonstrate our commitment to deliver more projectable growth and in earnings and cash flows. I'm proud of our team for the extensive work on these transactions as well as the continued dedication of our employees at Duke Energy International, who have managed the business very well throughout the process. We look forward to a timely close as we exit our Latin American generation business and we're pleased to welcome the Piedmont employees to Duke Energy. Turning to Slide 5. Consistent with the transition of portfolio today we are announcing the realignment of our financial reporting segment structure beginning with our fourth quarter results. Perspectival we will discuss performance for three primary business segments. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure will be comprised of our regulated Electric Utilities in the Carolina's, Florida and the Midwest. This segment will also include our commercial transmission investments.  As previously noted Frank Yoho will lead our Gas Utilities and Infrastructure Business, which will contain Piedmont, our local gas distribution companies in Ohio and Kentucky, and our gas pipeline investments such as Atlantic Coast Pipeline, Sabal Trail, Constitution and Piedmont\u2019s existing joint venture investments.  With the realignment of our business Commercial Renewable will become its own segment. Meanwhile, Other will continue to include holding company interest expense and our captive insurance results. Other will also begin to include our National Methanol equity investment in the fourth quarter. With the divestiture of Latin American generation business, the balance of the international segment will be classified as discontinued operations starting in the fourth quarter of 2016. We will continue to report the earnings of this business in adjusted earnings per share until closing. Turning to Slide 6, let me update you on our strong financial results for the quarter. We announced third quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $1.68, an increase of $0.21 from the prior year. We generated higher adjusted earnings with strong results at our regulated utilities due to warmer summer weather and our continued commitment across management and operational excellence. As a result of the strong result through the first three quarters of the year, we are trending towards the high-end of our original 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share, this excludes cost associated with Hurricane Matthew. Turning to Slide 7, we are continuing to move forward and deliver strong results on our $30 billion growth capital plan, this plan aligns with our vision to invest capital in smarter energy solutions to generate cleaner energy and modernize the grid, creating value for customers and delivering earnings and dividend growth for our shareholders. Here are a few updates, site preparation activities are underway and are nearly $1 billion Western Carolinas Modernization Project with plant construction anticipated to begin in early 2017. This project allows us to retire our Asheville coal units early, build cleaner natural gas units and install renewable energy on the site. The project is on track to be completed by late 2019. In September, we work with the Indiana office to be utility consumer counsel to develop a plan to modernize and upgrade the Markland Hydro Station. This multiyear effort will increase the output of the nearly 50 year facility, producing low cost, carbon free electricity for Indiana residence for years to come. For the agreement, the approximately $150 million investment and related expenses will be recovered through the recently approved renewable energy rider. Last week we issued an RFP for 400 megawatts of renewable energy in our Duke Energy Carolina's service territory. This furthers our efforts to provide renewable energy to our customers because project must be in operation by December 31, 2018. Also in Carolina, we recently filed for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity or CPCN for our Duke University combined heat-and-power projects. The projects will consistent of natural gas fired generated, that also provides steam service to the campus and lowers the University's carbon dioxide emissions by 25%. Combined heat-and-power projects represented an attractive energy solution that could benefit many of our universities and other larger industrial customers in the years to come. Shifting to our natural gas infrastructure investments, we continue to make investments in integrity management programs within our local distribution companies and advance construction of our pipeline projects. Let me briefly update you on Sabal Trail, Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Constitution. Construction on the Sabal Trail pipeline began in August and the project remains on track for June, 2017 in-service dates. Since our last earnings call, we have received FERC's notices schedule for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, based on this schedule we expect to receive the final FERC certificate and begin construction in the third or fourth quarter of 2017. This schedule moves our expected in-service date to the second half of 2019. In September the project partners announced the selection of Spring Bridge constructors as the lead construction contractor representing a significant milestone for the pipeline. This firm is a joint venture, a forward leading U.S. Natural Gas Pipeline Construction Company with the extensive experience in similar projects.  As you recall we have now added Piedmont's 24% stake in the Constitution Pipeline to our portfolio. FERC approved this project in December of 2014. However in April of 2016 the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) refused to grant the project\u2019s water quality certificate. In response the project filed lawsuits with the U.S. court of appeal to the second circuit and the U.S. District Court of Northern New York seeking to overturn DECs actions. Both of these lawsuits continue to progress with oral arguments before the U.S. Court of Appeal scheduled for November 16th and we expect a decision in this case by mid-2017. We continue to believe that the business case for this pipeline is compelling, as the northeast lacks adequate access of lower cost supplies of natural gas that this pipeline provides. Before, I turn it over to Steve, I'd like to highlight on Slide 8 several of our recent operational accomplishments made possible by the dedication of our employees. As many of you know we manage through two major hurricanes this fall. After Hurricanes Hermine hit the south east in early in early September, our team restored power quickly and safely for more than 200,000 Florida customers, and 150,000 Carolina's customers. Then Hurricane Matthew, a historic storm stuck to our Florida and Carolina's Service Territories in October. The storm tragically resulted in multiple fatalities and wide spread flooding impacting many of our customers across the Carolina's. The flooding, wind and rain caused extensive damage to our energy system leaving more than 1.7 million customers without power. Piedmont\u2019s infrastructure experienced minimum damage.  In terms of customer outrages Hurricane Matthew is the fifth worst storm to hit the combined Duke Energy Carolina's Duke Energy Progress Service Area with damage similar in scale the Hurricane Floyd in 1999 and Hurricane Hugo in 1989. In response we mobilized more than 10,000 workers to rebuild the system and restore power for our customers. We continue to work with the hardest hit areas as they look to recover and rebuild. I'm extremely proud of our employees and our unwavering commitments to serving our communities. Given the magnitudes of the storm we intend to request a deferral of incremental cost and will ask that they be considered as part of our next base rate cases for Duke Energy progress for the majority of damage occurred. Our current estimate of incremental cost is approximately $200 million. We are still in the process of refining this preliminary cost estimates.  Moving to our generation fleet results in the quarter our fleet responded well to the hot summer weather. Our nuclear units at Catawba and McGuire's set new generation records and our Edwardsport plant set a new station record for generation in the quarter.  Also in the third quarter Duke Energy was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for the 11th consecutive year. This consistent run demonstrates the effectiveness of our sustainability, economic and environmental and social efforts. This is a significant achievement earned by the entire company.  In addition, we were named as Site Selection Magazine's annual list of Top 10 utilities in economic development for the 12th consecutive year. Another example of our focus on developing our communities and growing our customer base. Through September our economic development efforts have yielded almost $3 billion of investments and more than 10,000 jobs across our service territories. In conclusion, I am very pleased with our progress on the transition of the portfolio and in delivering strong financial results in the quarter and building momentum for a strong finish to 2016. We are advancing our strategic capital investments and maintaining our focus on operational excellence and value to our customers. Our portfolio of businesses is well-positioned to deliver strong predictable earnings and cash flows to our investors. Now let me turn the call over to Steve. Steve Young : Thanks, Lynn. Today, I\u2019ll walk you through the key drivers from the third quarter as well as provide updates on the current retail volume trends within our service territories and regulatory activity underway in our jurisdictions. I\u2019ll close with looking heads to 2017 and our key investor considerations. I'll start with the quarterly results on Slide 9 and discuss our adjusted earnings per share variances compared to the prior year quarter. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year and a reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. As a remainder, this is the last quarter for existing segment structure. We began managing the business under new segments at the beginning of the fourth quarter upon the completion of the Piedmont acquisition. On a reported or GAAP basis, 2016 third quarter earnings per share were $1.70 compared to $1.35 last year. Third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.68 compared to $1.47 in the third quarter of 2015. Regulated Utilities quarterly adjusted results increased by $0.34 per share quarter-over-quarter. This strong performance was primarily driven by warmer weather across all of our service territories which added $0.14. We also recognized a lower effective tax rate primarily due to prior year tax adjustments which contributed to an $0.08 increase. Higher revenues from energy efficiency riders in the Carolina's and grid investments riders in Ohio continue to be favorable drivers of earnings adding $0.05 to results for the quarter. Whether normal retail volumes also added $0.04 with growth primarily in the Carolina and Florida, I\u2019ll discuss those details in a moment. Finally, our cost management efforts across the business provided the $0.02 uplift, despite additional storm cost in the third quarter. Our ongoing commitment to managing O&M cost and finding efficiencies throughout our business, position us to achieve our goal of maintaining a flat O&M cost structure through 2020. Commercial portfolio results increased by $0.02 per share in the third quarter, the higher results were largely driven by additional wind and solar facilities placed online this year and more favorable wind resources throughout the summer months. Moving on, Other was down $0.14 for the quarter, largely driven by our higher effective tax rate due to prior year tax benefits and a current year unfavorable audit settlements. These unfavorable tax items offset the favorable tax variance in the regulated utilities segment. For the year we continue to expect a total company adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 31%, compared to our original expectation of 32% to 33%. This is primarily due to the favorable tax benefit realize at international in the first quarter. Our first three quarters have been strong reflecting favorable weather and strong execution on the part of our team. As we look to the fourth quarter, I would like to share a few considerations. First, Piedmont will contribute $0.03 to $0.05 in the fourth quarter, in regulated utilities we have taken the opportunity to re-plan some of our O&M work including advancing a fossil plant outrage and some distribution projects into the fourth quarter. In addition, the prior year results included the favorable Ohio regulatory settlement. Meanwhile at commercial renewables we expect a relatively flat quarter compared to the prior year and for the segment to finish below original expectations for the full year. Market returns continue to decline and we remain disciplined on renewables capital deployment. With our strong year-to-date results through the third quarter and our expectations for the fourth quarter we are trending for the high end of our original guidance range excluding cost associated with Hurricane Matthew. Moving on to Slide 10, let's review our retail customer volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather normalized retail load was 0.6% through the third quarter and continues to track our long term expectations of approximately 0.5% load growth. Overall we are pleased with the strength of our residential volumes, which continued to grow at 1.1% over the last 12 months. A strong 1.4% annual increase in the number of new customers drives this growth. Utility sponsored energy efficiency programs and more efficient building codes and standards continue to partially offset this customer growth. Recently we have seen the decline in usage per customer beginning to level out of it. Looking forward positive trends in new job and wage growth as well as a recovery and housing are positive signs for continued residential growth. Moving to the customer class, we experienced an increase of 0.4% over the rolling 12 months and improvement compared to last quarter. Commercial usage is slowly improving across our jurisdictions as non-manufacturing employment improves and office vacancies continue to decline, even with new office space being added. These improvements were somewhat offset by commercial businesses supporting manufacturing. In addition, we continue to see declines in the government and education sectors especially in the Midwest. In the industrial class, we see growth of 0.2% on a rolling 12-month basis. Industries that support construction and automotive continue to show resilience. However the metals industry is once again experiencing declines. We will closely monitor economic conditions and our customer usage patterns throughout the remainder of the year and into 2017.  Moving to Slide 11, let me take a moment to discuss the status of the DET's South Carolina rate case. In October we reached a constructive settlement with the office of regulatory staff and other key intervening parties. The settlement was reviewed by the Public Service Commission and Staff Carolina during a hearing earlier this week. The major components of the settlement were largely consistent with our initial filing, we requested that the $79 million increase with an allowed ROE of 10.75% and equity structure of 53% and a rate base of 1.3 billion. Our significant energy infrastructure investments were the key drivers for the proposed increase. The settlement provides for the $56 million revenue increase and an allowed ROE of 10.1%. We also agreed to a 53% equity structure and a $1.3 billion rate base. If the settlement is approved as filed new rates are expected to be effective in January 2017. Customer rates would be implemented over a two year period in year one customer bills will increase by $38 million then step up to $56 million in year two. DEP will reduce its cost to removal liability by $18 million in year one to provide a neutral earnings impact to the company in the first year of rate implementation. Based on the settlement coal ash cost that had incurred will be recovered with a return over a 15 year amortization period and we agreed to differ any future rates cases to 2019. This settlement is an important milestone and we expecting an order from the commission in the coming weeks. With the transition in our business portfolio, I want to provide you some broad parameters for 2017 on Slide 12. Consistent with past practice we will provide guidance for 2017 including a five year capital plan during our February earnings call. We anticipate growth in the core businesses electric and gas infrastructure and commercial renewables of about 5% off of the $4.30 midpoint of our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance range. Accretion from Piedmont is expected to be $0.08 to $0.10 per share in 2017 a strong first year reflecting the benefits of early integration. We will provide additional perspective on growth capital in all of our segments in February. International results through closing use of sales proceeds and National Methanol are expected to contribute between $0.10 and $0.15 per share in 2017. National Methanol will move to other and contribute $0.05 per share based on prevalent Brent crude oil prices in our ongoing ownership percentage, which is expected to set down in 2017. The use of proceeds from the sale of our Latin American generation assets of 1.7 billion to 1.9 billion will displace future financing at the holding company and we will also contribute about $0.05 per share based on current interest rates. We estimate first quarter operating results from our international business could also add up to $0.05 per share of earnings depending upon the timing of the close. We look forward to further discussion of 2017 and beyond in February. I\u2019ll close with Slide 13, Duke Energy has tremendous scale offering in attractive investor value proposition which includes balanced growth in earnings and reliable dividends overtime. Within months we expect to complete our multiyear portfolio transition, affirming our commitment to provide low risk, high quality earnings and cash flows, and supporting our long term growth projections. We will continue to invest in cleaner energy resources, modernize the energy grid and build our natural gas platform and provide enhanced services for our customers. With that let's open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instruction] We will take our first question from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Michael Weinstein : Could you discuss in a little more detail the -- I think you said that there was a -- the results from commercial renewables was not as what you expected. Just wondering if you could discuss some of the issues surrounding that. Lynn Good : Michael, I would you direct you to the Slide 16 of the deck which gives you a comparison of where we are for year-to-date results against original expectations. Can you see commercial has delivered about 65 million of net income against our original expectations of a 140 million. We are not expecting that will deliver a 140 million for \u201916. Some of that short fall will be the result of lesser capital deployment as Steve mentioned, returns have been very market driven, so break for customers but load for investors. And then we continue to expect to be slightly behind on wind on solar resources as a result of what we've seen in weather patterns. So those are the two things that I would point too. Michael Weinstein : Is it that the market for investment has become more competitive than you expected, let's say, a year ago, that returns on acquisitions are just smaller than you thought? Or is this more of a weather issue? Lynn Good : I think returns are lower, Michael and I think the other thing to consider for Duke as an investor we are in an NOL position as a result of bonus depreciation and so as we look at returns we consider that the monetization of tax credits need to reflect when we will be a cash tax payer, so the DCF of that can challenge our returns. So that's something that we\u2019ll continue to monitor. As the time progresses we understand the market well, we have great expertise in both wind and solar base on the business that we've built, we still like for business, but we are declined in the way we deploy the capital based on the returns we\u2019re seeing in the market. Michael Weinstein : How long does that NOL position go out to? What do you expect? Steve Young : As currently we are expecting assuming there are no further extensions of bonus that we would come out of the NOL position in 2019. We would then begin using tax credits ITC production tax credits, so we would still not be a significant cash tax player for a few years after that. Michael Weinstein : But that, in theory, could make the renewables business a little more competitive for you, right? Lynn Good : I think as we get closer to that period of tax where we burn off the NOL that will impact our view of returns Michael, because the relative value the tax credits will be greater. Michael Weinstein : Alright, understood. Thank you. Operator : Will take our question from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Ali Agha : First question, Steve, the proceeds from the international sale, as you mentioned, you are going to use to pay off parent debt. Can you remind me, on average, what's the average interest rate on the debt that you are paying off? Steve Young : When we did the calculation, we come up with roughly $0.05. We\u2019re looking at long-term holding company rate, might be in the 3.5% to 4% type range of that nature. So that's the basis of what we\u2019re looking at and we've baked that into our financing plans anticipating that to happen we\u2019ll initially take down some bridge facilities of shorter term with the proceeds. Ali Agha : Okay. But there is enough -- that high cost, or relatively high cost, debt available to get that kind of savings? Steve Young : Well, what I'm speaking about is, we\u2019ve anticipated this and baked it into our financing plans to avoid issuances of hold co. at that higher level. Lynn Good : So, Ali, if you think about it, as 1.7 billion to 1.9 billion of proceeds coming into the holding company. So the average rate as Steve reference is consistent with that. Ali Agha : I see. Then second, the commercial results that you are getting, $65 million year-to-date, or $140 million for the year, I guess a little lower now -- how much of that roughly is the recognition of tax credits? Lynn Good : Tax credits are going to be a significant part of the renewable return. Ali, I don\u2019t have an exact number in front of me, we do have a modest amount of contribution in commercial fund of pipelines at this point to the third quarter, we\u2019ll move that to the gas infrastructure segment in the fourth quarter. Steve Young : That\u2019s correct. The results for the commercial portfolio reflects small amounts of AFUDC on the pipelines, that will be growing. But right now it is primarily from the renewables business and that is heavily driven by the recognition of the tax benefits. Ali Agha : Got it. Last question. Lynn, as you look at this portfolio now, post the international sale, and you look at your utility footprint, is everything essentially core as far as Duke is concerned? And related to that, as you are looking at growth over at least the next three, four years, does M&A come back into the mix for you as you are looking to deliver growth for shareholders? Lynn Good : So Ali, the businesses that we earned coming out the transition are all core and I think the strength of the franchises we own in the South-east both Gas and Electric and then a strong position in mid-West are core businesses. And we\u2019ll be looking to drive growth for investment that build on cleaner forms of generation and strengthening our grid and driving growth and providing value to customers, that will be job one at Duke. I believe M&A represents something that we will continue to look at as opportunity for rise, and I think we\u2019ve demonstrated a track record of successful integration of M&A candidates, but job one, as I said is growing core businesses that we own. Ali Agha : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instruction] We will take our next question from Maxwell Burke with Citi. Maxwell Burke : So maybe just jumping back to your renewable portfolio, when you are underwriting these investments, do you generally assume that the PPA cash flows are going to cover the full investment cost? Or do you assume some residual value, post-PPA, in order to recover that investment? Lynn Good : We will typically assign some terminal value beyond the contract period. Maxwell Burke : Okay, got it. And maybe just as a follow-up, can you provide any guidance on how you think about valuation, post-PPA? Do you make some assumption around re-contracting, or do you apply a dollar KW [ph] multiple, or some other method? Lynn Good : We look at a variety of things as we think about terminal value including forward curves as well as market experience. And so our contracts are the majority of the value that we are looking at and so terminal was something and we look at a range of possible outcomes. Maxwell Burke : Got it, thanks. Operator : It appears there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back to Ms. Lynn Good for closing remarks. Lynn Good : Thank you everyone for your interest and investment in Duke Energy. We have made tremendous progress this quarter and look forward to see many of you in the coming months and at the EDI Financial Conference next week. Thank you.",

Please note the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. With that, I'll turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $4.69, closing out a very successful 2016. We delivered strong operational and financial results, ending the year at the high end of our guidance range. We completed our multiyear transition of our business portfolio, with the well executed exit from our International operations and the acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas. Through it all, we maintained strong earnings growth in our core businesses and continued to increase our dividend. 2016 was clearly a pivotal year for Duke Energy and it's a key indicator of the success we expect going forward. As you see on slide 4, today Duke Energy enters 2017 with premier electric and natural gas franchises operating in constructive jurisdictions and with a demonstrated track record of strong execution. With our scale and portfolio of complementary businesses, we benefit from a wide range of investment opportunities. And as you will hear today, we're excited about our five-year $37 billion growth capital plan, up approximately 25% from last year. We have strong growth in every segment underpinned by capital, delivering value to our customers. Today, we extended our consolidated growth rate of 4% to 6% through 2021, which is off of the midpoint of our 2017 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.50 to $4.70. Our capital plan and regulatory strategy has been designed to produce earnings within this range each year of the five-year plan. And as the investments build and recovery accumulates, we're even more confident of our ability to reach the high end of the growth range. The assets we have, coupled with the strategy that produces real results, offer a solid long-term investment opportunity. We are positioned to deliver growth in earnings and dividends in a low risk, predictable and transparent way, providing an attractive risk-adjusted shareholder return for our investors. As a capital-intensive business, our growth is supported by the scale and strength of our balance sheet, which remains the continued focus for our company. In short, our attractive yield and demonstrated ability to reliably grow our regulated businesses positions Duke Energy as the leading infrastructure investment. We have a great story to share today. And in a moment, Steve will provide details on our five-year capital plan. I want to spend the next few minutes offering insight into our long-term vision for Duke Energy and where we plan to take our company in the next decade. Our industry is undergoing transformation, from increasing customer and stakeholder expectations to rapid technology development and new public policy requirements. The companies that succeed in this dynamic environment are those who anticipate and adapt. We see great opportunity in this period of transformation. And our focus is highlighted on slide 6, investing in infrastructure, our customers value and delivering sustainable growth for our investors. Slide 7 shows how that vision is manifested. We will invest at areas that position us well for this transformation; strengthening and modernizing our energy grid, generating cleaner energy through natural gas and renewables, and building natural gas infrastructure to support the growing need for this important resource, and by building on a foundation of customer satisfaction and stakeholder engagement. Everything we do begins with customer service, and we also understand that working collaboratively with our stakeholders is critical to our success. To paint a clearer picture of where we're going, we pulled back the lens and outlined on slide 8 our aspirations for the next 10 years. We will relentlessly pursue our goal of achieving and sustaining top quartile customer satisfaction, placing the customer at the center of everything we do. We will strengthen our energy delivery system, investing $25 billion to create a more modern, smarter energy grid. We will generate cleaner energy through natural gas and renewables, investing $11 billion as we move to a lower-carbon future. We will expand our natural gas infrastructure to meet customers' needs, doubling earnings contribution of our natural gas business. And we will enable more timely recovery of revenues in all of our jurisdictions, as we work to improve regulatory cost recovery mechanisms. Of course, any success we achieve is grounded in our commitment to maintaining industry-leading safety standards and operational excellence remains as the foundation of all we do. Our success starts here. Today, Duke Energy leads the industry in employee safety, and we will continue that leadership in the years ahead. This is our path. It's ambitious and it's achievable. Let me spend a few minutes on each investment area. First, turning to slide 9, I will discuss grid modernization and our objective to improve system performance and enable additional capabilities through smarter energy infrastructure. Our transmission and distribution network is the largest in the nation, and on its own, our Carolinas system is the sixth largest. Our scale requires consistent capital investment. But in this era of transformation, the demands on our system have never been greater. And while the system is reliable, recent events such as Hurricane Matthew have highlighted opportunities to strengthen the grid. We have outlined a 10-year $25 billion plan to modernize, building a more flexible, reliable system. We have already begun this important work in the Midwest, with plans to expand it into our other jurisdictions. We're using data analytics to inform our investment plans, delivering the highest value to our customers. This work will direct our targeted undergrounding programs, as well as a number of other reliability and integrity upgrades. Additionally, new technologies available today will advance our energy grid and deliver services our customers and communities increasingly expect. Our initial investment will focus on enhancing basic services with smart meters and communications technologies, increasing power quality and improving reliability. These investments will also support more distributed energy resources on our system. Subsequent capital spending will integrate emerging technologies, such as storage and improved remote monitoring, communications and control. We expect to reduce our outage frequency and duration rates by 50%, and significantly reduce our O&M expenses through the deployment of more advanced technology. Much of this work will also support our goal of moving the company into the top quartile for customer satisfaction. Our next major investment platform focuses on generating cleaner energy. I'm proud of our efforts to reduce our environmental footprint, including reducing our carbon dioxide emissions by 29% since 2005. As you can see on slide 10, our retirement of more than 40 older, less efficient coal units, coupled with the addition of clean natural gas plants and renewable, is driving our emissions reduction. In the next 10 years, we will invest $11 billion, increasing new, highly-efficient natural gas generation to 35% of our portfolio, and cleaner renewable energy sources to approximately 10%. These renewable energy sources include hydro, wind and solar. With these investments and our carbon-free nuclear generation, by 2026, we will reduce carbon emissions by 35% from our 2005 levels. In addition to regulated renewables, we will also invest in commercial renewable assets, as we continue to pursue projects that meet our return criteria. Reducing our carbon footprint is important to many in our communities. We remain focused on being a leader with environmental stewardship at the forefront of our plans. Moving to slide 11, our third area of investment focus is natural gas infrastructure. We look at the future of this industry and the future generation needs of our company, natural gas will continue to play a major role. With the acquisition of Piedmont, we now operate a five-state gas distribution business and have investments in midstream natural gas pipelines. We rank second nationally for natural gas consumption across our electric utilities and LDCs. This underscores how these business will continue to complement one another. With more than 90% of our margins in the LDC business mostly fixed through decoupling and weather normalization mechanisms and our low-risk natural gas pipeline investment portfolio, we have very little exposure to volumetric risk in this business. Similar to our electric businesses, our LDCs, which serve more than 1.5 million customers, are located in states with strong customer growth of over 1% over the last five years, including customer growth of 1.5% at Piedmont. Our growing midstream business is anchored by our investments in highly contracted pipelines such as Atlantic Coast, Sabal Trail, and Constitution. This infrastructure will bring much needed gas supplies to the Eastern U.S. for an economic growth and helping us grow our customer base in the Southeast. Atlantic Coast Pipeline is a prime example of the tremendous overlap between our electric utilities, LDCs, and midstream pipeline investments, driven by transportation contracts with our natural-gas-fired plant and Piedmont. ACP will provide opportunities for industrial and manufacturing growth and infrastructure investment in our Eastern Carolinas communities. This growth, as well as combined heat and power, coal-to-gas conversions and dual-fuel projects will boost our gas business. We look forward to benefiting from coordinated infrastructure planning between our electric and gas utilities as we prepare for new gas-fired generation facilities that will maximize this new gas platform. We also anticipate continued economic development opportunities across the region as a result. In the next 10 years, we expect our natural gas platform to account for 15% of our portfolio, up from 8% today, as we expand and scale our natural gas business. Before turning to Steve, let me turn to slide 12 and touch on a few policy issues that are top of mind for investors. We are engaged with Congress and the new administration as they begin to address important policy issues impacting our company and customers. The President and congressional leaders have an ambitious agenda that includes a few particular areas of focus for us, including tax reform and infrastructure policy. While it's early in the process and much work remains ahead, Duke Energy supports many of the goals of comprehensive tax reform, which could benefit our customers and support critical investments needed for economic growth. No specific legislation has been introduced, so we are working with the administration's campaign tax plan and the House GOP blueprint. We've analyzed a number of scenarios to evaluate a range of potential impact to our business. Our preliminary analysis shows that the administration's tax plans, which would allow the option to retain interest deductibility and forego immediate expensing of capital, is neutral to slightly accretive for our company on a consolidated basis. On the House GOP plan, the range of potential outcomes will be impacted by a number of factors, including the treatment of existing debt and other transition rules. The loss of interest deductibility and immediate expensing of capital will impact our utility rate base over the long term. But given our NOL position, it's not expected to have a material impact over the next five years. It's important to recognize, however, that loss of interest deductibility will permanently impact the cost of capital to our customers, whereas expensing is a timing difference. The most significant impact from the House GOP plan is on our holding company. If we assume the loss of interest deductibility on new and refinanced holding company debt and a lower tax shied on existing debt, the impact could be approximately 5% dilutive by 2021. We all recognize that we're in the very early stages of this matter, and we will continue to update our analysis as more specific information becomes available. We'll also actively engage in advocacy on tax reform, along with EEI and other industry CEOs. Given the capital intensity of our industry and the relatively high leverage percentage supported by regulations, we believe better tax policy should retain interest deductibility and forego immediate expensing of capital expenditures. This approach is recognized in the administration's plan, and we will continue to meet key stakeholders to advocate for our position on behalf of our customers and investors. Turning to infrastructure, the regulated electric industry invests more than $100 billion annually in critical infrastructure, and Duke Energy accounts for nearly 10% of that figure, a welcome effort to streamline the siting and permitting of infrastructure project, such as grid investments and natural gas pipeline necessary to meet the long-term needs of our customers and communities. These topics are complex and will take time. We will be actively engaged with congressional leaders and administration officials to advocate on behalf of our customers and investors, emphasizing the critical role of low-cost energy in driving America's economy. So that's a brief overview of our longer-term strategy, now, let me turn it over to Steve to walk through our five-year financial plan. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thanks, Lynn. As mentioned, I am going to spend the majority of my time walking you through our five-year financial plan. Turning to slide 13, we are introducing our adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share today. In addition, now that we have successfully closed on the Piedmont and International transactions, we will anchor our long-term growth rate off of the midpoint of our 2017 guidance range of $4.60. Over the next five years, we anticipate growing our adjusted EPS by 4% to 6%, consistent with the historic growth rate we have achieved in our domestic businesses. In 2017, our results will be driven by our ongoing investments in electric and gas infrastructure and retail and wholesale customer growth. Positive results in the electric business will also be driven by our base rate increases in Duke Energy Progress South Carolina, and the generation base rate adjustment mechanism in Florida. These positive drivers will be partially offset by higher depreciation, interest expense and other taxes, as we continue to place new assets in service. Given that we have completed the International sale in December, we will not have results from that business in 2017. That will have an approximate $0.05 benefit from the use of proceeds from that sale, and another $0.05 contribution from National Methanol, which we retained and is now reported in Other. Moving to slide 14, we have a robust five-year capital plan of nearly $50 billion in place to drive our 4% to 6% earnings growth. In fact, we have increased our growth capital plan to $37 billion, an increase of $7 billion, largely driven by grid modernization investments in the Carolinas and our growing gas platform. This investment plan will drive earnings base growth in our combined electric and gas businesses of approximately 6% over the next five years. As we look at each of our segments' contributions, electric utilities and infrastructure, representing 89% of our adjusted earnings, is well-positioned to grow at 4% to 5% over the next five years. Our gas utilities and infrastructure business will contribute approximately 8% to our 2017 results, with a five-years growth rate of 10% to 12%. And our Commercial Renewables segment, which includes owned wind and solar assets, as well as our operating services and third-party contracts, will contribute approximately 3% with a five-year growth rate of 8% to 12%. We are confident these businesses will generate stable earnings and cash flows delivering solid results in 2017 and beyond. Turning to slide 15, growth in our electric business will be supported by our five-year $30 billion growth capital plan, the investments align with our strategy to modernize the energy grid and to generate cleaner energy. Our plan also reflects environmental compliance cost of over $4 billion, including approximately $3 billion to safely close ash basins across our system. These significant investments drive a strong earnings-based CAGR of over 5.5% for our electric business through 2021. Now, let me walk you through additional details of our five-year plan for our electric business. On slide 16, you will see our focus on upgrading our transmission and distribution system. We have allocated nearly 60% of our $30 billion plan to transmission and distribution, which includes $10 billion for modernizing our grid infrastructure to make the system smarter and more reliable. The other $7 billion will be devoted to investing in our system for additional customer growth. Nearly 45% of the capital we invest in the grid will be devoted to storm hardening to ensure our system is better prepared for severe weather events. We will focus on key projects, such as elevating substations located in vulnerable or low-lying areas, and making our power poles more resilient. We are also identifying areas more susceptible to frequent power outages using data analytics capabilities. This information will be used as we develop our targeted undergrounding programs where we have allocated 25% of our grid investment to increase the reliability of our system for our customers. Another part of the program will include installing smart meters to provide better information and services for our customers, as well as additional cost efficiency. To-date, we have completed this effort in Ohio, and we'll be moving forward with smart meter installations in our other jurisdictions. We expect to fully deploy all smart meters across our system over the next five years. This accelerated deployment will allow us to offer additional products and services and help to reduce our overall O&M cost given that the advanced technology will avoid the need for many manual processes. Moving to slide 17, we are committed to further reducing our environmental footprint, with plans for new natural gas generation and renewables. Our five-year plan includes investment of $3.3 billion in highly-efficient natural gas-fired combined-cycle plants. This will include completing our Lee combined-cycle facility in South Carolina, our Western Carolinas Modernization Project in North Carolina, and our Citrus County plant in Florida, and beginning work on plants within service states beyond 2021. We are pursuing additional generation projects, such as dual-fuel capabilities and combined heat and power facilities to increase the flexibility of our system, as we continue to meet growing energy demands in the dynamic environment. We will also increase our focus on additional renewables in our regulated utilities. Our $1.3 billion investment plan for carbon-free utility-owned renewables will be led by investments in Florida and the Carolinas. Moving on to slide 18, we operate in attractive service areas where customer growth remains strong, especially in the Southeast, and continues to support load growth in our electric business. That, coupled with cost management, has allowed us to earn our ROEs even without significant rate cases since 2013. We are committed to earning these ROEs and generating stable earnings growth for our shareholders while we invest in infrastructure our customers value. In 2016, weather-normalized retail load growth was 0.2%. This was largely driven by lower-than-expected results in the industrial sector. One of our large Duke Energy Carolinas customers in the metals industry is reorganizing and plans to begin returning to full operations in 2018. And some other industrial customers saw similar pullbacks from operations, would expect to ramp up as we go forward. Looking ahead, we continue to expect approximately 0.5% load growth in our long-term planning assumptions. Several factors give us confidence that this assumption remains true. We are experiencing consistently strong customer growth, especially in our Carolinas and Florida regions given a recent uptick in construction in our service areas and greater housing permit applications. We've also seen a recent shift away from starts of multifamily homes to single-family homes. This shift is highlighted by the fact that four major cities within our service territories recently ranked among the top 16 in the country, with a number of single-family building permits filed. Two of these metro areas ranked in the top 5. The decline in the government sector has leveled out a bit, and we are cautiously optimistic about increased business investment in manufacturing, as inventory levels have declined from previously elevated levels. Based on current and expected economic trends, we're also optimistic about potential for the industrial sector to pick up in the next few years. These positive factors will be partially offset by the continued adoption of more efficient building codes and standards and utility-sponsored energy efficiency programs. While these programs do offset some of our customer growth, they also contribute to earnings through our approved energy efficiency riders. Overall, we believe all of these factors will allow us to achieve 0.5% load growth during our planning horizon. Regarding cost control, we have held O&M flat since 2014, and we'll look to continue that trend going forward, creating headroom and customer bills for important energy and infrastructure investments. 2016, we reduced our O&M costs even with unusually high storm costs compared to the prior year, and after re-planning O&M activities on behalf of our customers to take advantage of the above-normal weather. We committed to reducing our O&M cost in 2016, and we clearly delivered on that commitment. We have outlined our economic growth plan and significant capital investments that we will make over the next five years. Now, let me take a few minutes on slide 19 to discuss our plans for cost recovery, as we balance our growing business and maintaining competitive rates for our customers. We will be very active in the regulatory space over the next five years. As we have done in the past, we will continue to work constructively with key stakeholders to achieve results that benefit our customers and shareholders, while managing our cost to keep bill increases at a moderate level and overall rates below the national average. Investments we have planned will drive economic growth in our desirable service areas and support additional customers and new technologies. As you can see, we will file two base rate cases with the North Carolina Utilities Commission in 2017; one for our Duke Energy Carolinas utility and the other for Duke Energy Progress. Both North Carolina cases are scheduled to be filed in the summer of 2017, anticipating new rates effective in the first half of 2018. These filings will be the first in North Carolina in four years to recover costs associated with our capital investments and more efficient generation such as the Lee combined cycle facility, nuclear projects, and coal ash basin closure activities. Looking beyond 2017, we're making substantial investments in the grid. As we look to accelerate those investments over the next five years, we will be engaged in the regulatory and legislative process to pursue recovery mechanisms such as multi-year rate plans and trackers which are better suited to grid infrastructure. As these regulatory modernization initiatives move forward, we will also evaluate more frequent base rate cases in the interim to ensure timely recovery and more moderate rate impacts to our customers. Updated constructs would avoid the need for filing numerous larger rate cases and level out the rate impact to our customers. Turning to Florida, we are also planning additional transmission investment and additional renewable projects, as we look to 2019 and beyond. The regulatory construct in the state of Florida, which includes generation-based rate adjustments, solar-based rate adjustments and multi-year rate plans, is well-suited to our investment plan. We will continue to make significant investments in the transmission and distribution systems in Indiana and Ohio, with timely recovery of the investments through previously approved riders. As we turn to our gas segment on slide 20, we have outlined the five-year $6 billion growth capital plan to expand our national gas infrastructure and further develop this platform. Our plans are split evenly between investments in our LDCs and our midstream gas pipelines. This business will grow rapidly, driven by an earnings-based CAGR of 11% over the next five years as part of our larger 10-year plan to grow this business to 15% of earnings. Growth in this segment will come from strong organic growth opportunities in our LDCs and midstream investments. We expect to deploy approximately $3 billion in our gas LDC systems, with Piedmont accounting for more than two-thirds of our LDC earnings base, and the Midwest accounting for the remaining third. Our LDCs will continue to invest in infrastructure for our growing customer base, as well as integrity management programs that maintain the safety of our system. These integrity investments are recovered efficiently through well-established riders in several of our jurisdictions. Moving to our midstream investments, we plan to invest an additional $3 billion in our pipelines during the five-year period, much of which will contribute to the completion of ACP. This project is now anticipated to cost between $5 billion and $5.5 billion, and is still expected to meet the second-half 2019 in-service date. We look forward to growing this platform as we expand our natural gas infrastructure and leverage the expertise of our Piedmont team. Turning to slide 21, I have already mentioned our $1.3 billion investment in regulated renewables. In addition, we will also invest $1 billion in commercial renewable assets. This expands upon the more than $5 billion we have already invested in our contracted commercial renewables business since 2007, focusing on entering long-term power purchase agreements with creditworthy counterparties. Our Commercial Renewables business continue to expand its wind and solar portfolio, ending the year with nearly 3,000 megawatts in 14 states. These commercial investments, plus our growing regulated renewables footprint, have positioned us as a top 5 renewables company in the country, and our plan will continue to advance that position. And we do not currently pay significant cash taxes. Due to our corporate net operating loss tax position, we will continue our disciplined approach to capital deployment in our commercial business, focusing on projects that meet our return criteria. Given the more attractive tax credit profile from the Production Tax Credit or PTC, we will explore wind projects more aggressively than solar in this segment. In 2016, we invested in approximately 1,000 megawatts of new wind projects that qualify for the 10-year PTC under Safe Harbor rules. This gives us flexibility to bid on RFPs over the next several years. Historically, we have not employed tax equity to finance our renewables projects. Given that we have had more efficient and less costly options, we are always seeking the most cost-effective means to develop and finance these projects, and we'll continue to evaluate other capital sources including tax equity structures when appropriate. Strong balance sheet and credit quality are foundational to our overall financial objectives. Slide 22 shows our high level 2017 cash flows and financing plan. With our portfolio transition complete, we have a better risk profile with more predictable and stable earnings and cash flows. We are supporting the balance sheet with $350 million of DRIP equity per year from 2018 to 2021, which will advance our efforts to fund the increasing level of growth investments in our business. We expect the frequent rate case activity and equity through our internal plans to strengthen our financial metrics over the five-year plan. I would also like to highlight S&P's recent affirmation of our ratings and revision of our outlook from negative to stable. This action reflects the strength of our balance sheet and confidence the rating agency has in our ability to execute on our commitments. Before I turn it back over to Lynn for closing remarks, let me turn to slide 23. We understand the value of the dividend to our shareholders and are committed to growing the dividend responsibly. We have paid a dividend for 91 consecutive years, demonstrating the steadfast commitment to our shareholders. Moving forward, we expect to maintain our annual dividend growth rate at approximately 4% to 6% through 2021, as we target a payout ratio in the 70% to 75% range. With that, I will turn it back over to Lynn. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Steve, thanks, and thanks to all of you who've joined the call today. We are excited about the future and remain confident in our ability to deliver strong growth and financial results. We have an ambitious and achievable strategy focused on investing in the grid, cleaner generation and natural gas infrastructure, all while modernizing our cost recovery mechanisms and providing customers with the service they value. As this slide shows, we bring many advantages to this conversation, including scale, constructive jurisdictions, a track record of execution and importantly, we are unencumbered by the challenges that we have successfully put behind us. In conclusion, our vision for where we want to take Duke Energy is clear and compelling. Our strategy to achieve the vision is well underway. We have the right plan and are working to plan. It is producing results and we entered 2017 with confidence. We're well-positioned to deliver value for customers and steady growth, strong yields and an attractive risk-adjusted total shareholder return for our investors. That is a compelling investor proposition, representing a solid, long-term holding for our shareholders. Foundational to this proposition is the strength of our dividend and with an adjusted earnings growth plan of 4% to 6%, we feel confident in our ability to continue to grow the dividend. Over the long term, the combination of these factors has the potential to generate 8% to 10% total shareholder return to our investors. Now, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Jonathan Arnold, Deutsche Bank. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hello. Good morning, guys. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning, Jonathan. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you for all the details and the update. It's very helpful. I just have a question on the financing and the split between HoldCo and utility and project financing this year. It looks like it's a little over 40% HoldCo. Is that on a net basis? Is that something we should anticipate going forward? Do you stick with that structure, or is HoldCo a little up above where the trend will be? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: I don't know that it's necessarily going to be a trend. It'll be related to timing of maturities and other investments. So I don't think that there's any trend in that, Jonathan. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Yeah, Jonathan, our target, as we've laid out on the credit metrics slide, is to have low-30% overall HoldCo debt to total. So that's the long-term trend you should be thinking about. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So I guess that was the thrust of my question that it seems in 2017, you obviously \u2013 you'll be moving away from the target, and then it only comes down a little bit by 2021. So, how should we think about the 34% is \u2013 within \u2013 do you consider that to be in the target range or is it more sort of backend of the decade that you can \u2013 you get further back down towards it? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Well, as Lynn said, our target is in the low-30%s, and we're a bit above that as we work through this transition of our portfolio. But we'll be looking to move the HoldCo debt into our target range. And we're making progress to our five-year plan. And we'll continue to strive to get it to that point. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And then if I may just on tax, what gives you confidence that the sort of downside scenario under the House GOP is that interest deduction would only apply on new debt? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Jonathan, this is a fluid situation, as you know. And we've looked at a variety of scenarios. We thought presenting the new HoldCo debt would give you a sense of where the exposure is. We recognize we do have downside exposure under the GOP plan. As this continues to develop and legislation is introduced and we learn more specifics, of course, we'll update that. But we thought it was a reasonable planning assumption to share with you at this point based on our understanding of how things are developing. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. But if we wanted to think about what the implications of losing it on the embedded \u2013 the existing debt, I would take the $557 million of HoldCo 2017 interest plus the $87 million in commercial renewables and eliminate the 20% assumed tax shield.... Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: ...I'll give you a \u2013 yeah, I'll give you a quick one. It's closer to 7%. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. All right. So, I'll let someone else go. Thank you very much. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thanks so much. Operator : And we'll go to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning, Stephen. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thought that was a very thorough and thoughtful update on your strategy and growth outlook. Let me just follow up on Jonathan on tax reform which I imagine is a popular topic. When you look at potential levers, I'm thinking first about the potential loss or the potential immediate expensing of CapEx. You obviously have a lot of growth levers at your disposal. How would you think about potentially changing your spending profile to the extent that, that actually got enacted that you immediately expense CapEx? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Well, if you move in that direction with the immediate expensing of CapEx, one thing I'd say, we're currently in an NOL position throughout the majority of our five-year planning horizon. So, the immediate expensing to CapEx would deepen that NOL position at the backend of our plan. So it's not a significant rate base change for us during the five-year plan. Broadly speaking, I would say, as you heard from our capital planning as a whole, we have a lot of investment opportunities as we rebuild the grid and decarbonize and produce cleaner energy. And those opportunities I think will carry us for quite a while. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. Thank you. And then, just shifting over to solar and energy storage and grid modernization, I think you're pretty clear in your plans. But let's assume that cost for solar continue to fall and storage continue to fall. Later in the decade, is there a potential for accelerating spending there? How do you think about solar and storage for your \u2013 I'm really thinking for your regulated territories in terms of the potential for additional spending there? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Yeah, Stephen, I think that is a developing area that we continue to pursue. I think you're aware we have an RFP out now for 400 megawatts in the Carolina, the western part of the state, and we're also in discussions around our avoided cost filing which could provide a pathway for additional solar. We believe there is a wealth of investment opportunities, and putting forward $1.3 billion, we're targeting a substantial investment, but I could see scenarios in which it can go higher. Our objective is to own some amount of the solar in the state of North Carolina and Florida and our other service territories, and we're working to move in that direction. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. And on storage, Lynn, is there a role for storage any time soon, or is it really just premature given the fairly low penetration of renewable energy in your territories? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: It's modest, Stephen, over the next five years. We do have probably a half a dozen to a dozen sites that are under development where we have batteries in place on our system ranging in size from small residential, all the way up to a 35-megawatt battery paired with a wind farm in West Texas. As we look at this planning horizon, we do have some battery megawatts in our plan, but we see it as being a greater contributor, 2021 to 2025, than we do over the next five years. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. All right. Thank you very much. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : In your \u2013 I think in your early prepared remarks, you mentioned something about potentially being at the high end of the 4% to 6% growth rate over time. Could you just give \u2013 I missed the intro of that, could you repeat that and just what would you need to see to kind of be looking more at the high end? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Yeah. So, Steve, what I talked about is, it's really successful execution of this plan which includes ramping up investments such as the grid investment in the Carolinas, coupled with timely recovery gives us greater confidence at the higher end of the range. So we feel like we've got a plan that gives us that potential, and our assignment is to execute it. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And I guess \u2013 I mean, one thing might be just getting maybe through resolution of somebody's rate cases to get better visibility on those? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Sure. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: We have rate cases filed this year. I think better visibility might present to you how we have addressed rate cases for historical investments. Steve, I think it's important to recognize that we have a demonstrated track record of successful execution of regulatory outcomes. If you look at what we have accomplished around our jurisdictions, whether it's related in Florida, the new generation, Crystal River and Levy in Indiana, rate cases in the Carolinas, we have confidence that we can find the right balance between customers and investors and putting capital to work in our jurisdictions in a constructive way. So we come at this with a plan that we believe we can execute. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And just \u2013 should we assume the earned ROEs that you're kind of assuming in 2017 for the different states, or is that roughly kind of the range for the five-year plan? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: I think that's a reasonable assumption. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then one other question just on the coal ash. In the 2017 guidance, what are you assuming on how that is treated, just to continue deferral at a debt return, on equity return or... Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: So, for GAAP purposes, Steve, there will be \u2013 we only record a debt return on... Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: That's correct. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: ...on coal ash. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: It'll be a debt return. We'll continue to defer up until the point of commission order. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: And we will request coal ash recovery in the upcoming cases here in 2017. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Okay. Thank you very much. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning, Michael. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Good morning. How are you doing? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Just to follow up on Steve's question a little bit, so are you saying that the successful execution of the plan gets you to the higher end or the upper end of the range, and that even if there were some problems, you would still be at the midpoint? Is that a good way of looking at it? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: So, we've put together a plan exactly, Michael, that if we successfully execute, will position us at the higher end of the range. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got you. And in terms of the \u2013 can you discuss like the impact of the NOL position on the renewable growth plans? Because I remember it is a little bit slower now, and it sounds like you're going to be more focused on wind going forward. How is that being impacted by the NOL position? And also what's the status of the 500-megawatt plan for Florida solar? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yes. Regarding our NOL position and how it's impacting our commercial renewables, we've talked about this a bit in the past. We've been in an NOL position for a while, and under current rules, we're projecting to come out of that in 2020. And that affects the timing of the ability to monetize the various tax credits that these projects generate. In spite of that, we've been able to land projects and bring them in very efficiently and economically. As we move \u2013 what we've seen over the past years is that it's a competitive landscape with some narrowing margins there. We've still been able to put in service 500 megawatts of commercial renewables in 2016. So as we look forward, what we wanted to do is give an indication here that recognizing our NOL position. We will look at tax equity. Partnership arrangements is a possible financing tool. We've looked at that in the past, we haven't found anything that was acceptable, and we found other options that were more beneficial to us. But we will be open and continue to examine those possibilities. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Michael, a couple of additional things I would point to. As we get toward the end of the decade, we are planning at this point to be out of an NOL position, now that's setting aside tax reform which could of course change the landscape. So, we believe we'll become increasingly competitive as we enter the latter part of the decade under current tax law. And the other thing I would point to, consistent with your question on Florida, is that we have directed more capital in this plan to regulated renewables, $1.3 billion in the Carolinas and Florida, which we believe will be underpinned by increasing economics, improving economics of those investments in those states. And we will look for ways we can add that form of renewable which has a better return profile for our investors. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, great. Thank you. And also just one last question on taxes, I don't think you made any comments on the border-adjusted tax and how that might affect your operations at all? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Yeah. So, Michael, we do have some exposure to border-adjusted tax within our regulated businesses. I'd point to \u2013 our nuclear fleet is being impacted with fuel and so on. I think what's important is to recognize that our nuclear fleet is regulated that this would become a part of our cost of service. And we are \u2013 of course, as we advocate around impacts to customer rates, the benefits of low cost energy and other items, we are pointing this out in our advocacy plan to our key legislators, is important to Duke Energy and Duke Energy customers. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: All right. That's great. Thank you very much. And by the way, the presentation looks great. The new slides look very well done, so... Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: ...congratulations on doing that. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you very much. Operator : We'll go to Chris Turnure with JPMorgan. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. You touched on a couple things around the rate cases that you're going to file for in North Carolina this year, but I wanted to try to get some more detail there. And if we think over the last kind of four years, what has changed since the last filings and decisions there? I'm wondering how we can think about that. You've had some load growth. You definitely had rate base growth, but a big chunk of that is deferred with the coal ash expenses. So, are we kind of looking at you guys pretty much earning your authorized ROE right now and the main benefit of these cases being just a cash recovery on coal ash? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Chris, I would point to a couple of things. I think the other variable \u2013 and what has happened over the last four years is, we have executed very effectively on cost management, which gives us some headroom in order to put capital investment in and recovery in without raising prices in a significant way for our customers, and that's very important as we enter in a rate case. We do have capital investment. We intend to recover nuclearly combined cycle. We have deferred costs in the form of Hurricane Matthew, and, of course, we have recovery of ash. So it will be a mix of cash recovery and returns. And as we get closer to filing, of course, we'll give you more specifics on what we're filing for and the composition, and you can expect that later this year. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then my next question is on your capital plan for the next five years. You already talked about commercial renewable growth in there. But are there any placeholders that we should be aware of for kind of large lumpy projects that are not yet approved or kind of maybe even aspirational on the pipeline side or things of that nature for pipelines or other? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: No, we do have growth capital in the plan, Chris, and I would think of it in kind of the $500 million range over this five-year period. And we typically maintain some level of growth capital if you look at us historically because you think about five years, there's time to develop, and we want to put those aspirations out there. So there is some growth capital, kind of $500 million to $700 million, in the gas plan. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. But nothing kind of particularly large that would move things year-to-year if you were not successful in getting them. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: That's correct. Christopher J. Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : And Praful Mehta with Citi, your question next, please. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. And, yes, the slides do look great, so I appreciate it. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I had a quick question on holding company debt and tax reforms. I want to just quickly come back to that. If the interest deductibility does go away, do you plan to change the target holding company level that you want to have in terms of debt? And if you do, what are the level do you have in your tool kit right now to think about how you'll reduce that level over time? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: I think \u2013 let me start, and I'm sure Steve has some thoughts on this as well. I think as we think about tax reform, we turn the discussion to the holding company because of the impact. But I think as you face tax reform, you also have to look at what's happening to the underlying earnings power of the utilities and what options we have there. And that would be a part of the decision process on how we would address the holding company. Certainly, delevering could be something we would consider, but I think there's a lot of work to do before we would reach a conclusion like that. And so as this develops, we will continue to keep you informed. And we understand the assignment of mitigating impact to the extent we can, and that's one of the benefits of looking at scenarios that is underway right now. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Thank you. And then on the utility side, the growth profile you provided was very helpful through 2021. But if we have to look at retail customer rates, and I know there was a slide you provided with rates in 2017, but just to get a sense, well, what kind of load growth you're looking at over that timeframe, and how do you think rates would go or increase over that timeframe to get a sense for sustainability of that growth over time? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: So, we focus very keenly on customer rate impact. And you'll have more visibility on specifics as we think about the plans in 2017 as we announce these rate cases. But over a longer term, we target kind of rate of inflation for \u2013 CAGR for customer rate. So, that might be in the range of 2% to 3.5% depending on the jurisdiction. And we actually use that as a governor when we think about capital deployment and our cost of service because of the importance of keeping competitive rates. I think you recognize that we operate in a very competitive environment where our rates in the Carolinas in particular are 20% below national average, and that is an advantage to our service territories if we can continue to perform in that way. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: And we've seen rate reductions due to fuel over the past several years to our customers. So that's part of the overall picture as well. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. That's very helpful. Just a quick follow-up. So if there is, in fact, tax reform that reduces customer bills just because of newer tax rates, does that mean you have more headroom to spend more CapEx during that timeframe? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yes. In general, if income taxes are lower like any other operational expense, that provides an opportunity for a utility to make further investments in infrastructure under the same rate scheme. So those can be beneficial situations that we have taken advantage of in the past. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Thank you, guys. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll go to Brian Chin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Brian. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Brian. Brian Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good morning. I guess following up on Praful's earlier questions related to debt. On the HoldCo debt, does the 5% dilutive comment on the House plan, does that incorporate expected changes to the HoldCo debt structure or is that just holding the HoldCo debt outlook in your plan constant and then you could react to it later to mitigate that 5% dilutions? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: It's a modeled level of HoldCo debt in our five-year plan, also considering cash flow impact that we can see in a very preliminary way from the utilities up to the parent. And so that's about a 5% dilutive, Brian. Brian Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got you. Got you. Okay, great. And then one other thing, the grid modernization CapEx update is pretty helpful here. What proportion of the grid modernization spending is subject to legislative approval? I think based on the last couple of conversations I've had with you, there were some legislation in the Carolinas, for example, that was necessary for some of that spending, can you just give a little bit of color on that? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: There's nothing subject to legislative approval, Brian. We believe the compelling customer value for this is quite strong. And so we have been discussing the importance of infrastructure growth in our jurisdictions, Carolinas, in both the regulatory and legislative level to inform them of the opportunity that exist here and the value we think we can deliver. We also see it as an economic development driver in our service territories. As we set out a long-term plan where workforce could be developed to work in areas that are rural areas of the state, we think there's a compelling business case for the leaders of the state. Brian Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Appreciate the clarification. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Congrats on a good start to the year. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you, Mike. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I have a question, just \u2013 I'm looking at the detail you provide in slide 18, and you show the adjusted book ROEs by state. And then you talk about O&M cost to management and the need to file rate cases in North Carolina. And I'm \u2013 I'm just \u2013 I'm a little confused only because you're kind of expecting on a 10% to 10.5% or so ROE in the Carolinas. And you're also managing O&M in the Carolinas as one of your bigger jurisdictions. So just curious what drives the need for a case, especially in a state that typically uses historical test years? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yes, Michael. We've got a number of things occurring here. We've been deferring a lot of costs on our balance sheet that we need to start getting some recovery on. Coal ash is certainly one of those items. We've spent about $900 million on coal ash to-date. We requested and have deferred Hurricane Matthew cost to the tune of about $150 million as well. So, we'll be seeking recovery in some form or fashion of those types of costs. Additionally, we have had infrastructure buildup. Nuclear uprates and the Lee combined-cycle plant are two good examples there that we'll be incorporating into rates. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. But wouldn't those things be weighing on \u2013 right, if they're already in service, you would have lost the AFUDC. Wouldn't they be weighing on the earned returns? And yet it seems like you're doing a great job of actually earning your ROEs there. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: We have been. To the extent you make capital investments and put them into plant and service, they will weigh on the earned returns. But that's where we have worked very diligently to control our O&M cost, to expand our wholesale sales, to keep our regulated ROEs up. But now, as we move forward, it's time to catch up that rate base growth. And also, we do have the singular Lee combined-cycle plant as an example that will be timed with rate recovery, which will be moving from CWIP to in-service. So there's a number of factors, as we've mentioned earlier, some deferred cost cash recoveries and some earnings uplift potentials as well, a mix of the two. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And last thing, just thinking about the O&M cost management. You're saying a 5% reduction and I'm still on that kind of same slide, page 18. Is that a 5% reduction on the total kind of GAAP level of $6.2 billion, or a 5% reduction on that smaller number, the $4.6 billion or $4.7 billion? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: It's on the non-recoverable O&M number. The smaller number there. The larger number has recoverables and pass-through type items, as well as some cost-to-achieve type items. So, we're looking at the non-recoverable, lower number. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay, guys. Thank you, Lynn. Thanks, Steve. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you, Mike. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Much appreciated. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Sure. Operator : We'll go to [Robert Tsong] with SunTrust. Unknown Speaker : Hi, good morning. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning, Robert. Unknown Speaker : Hi. Just a really quick question on the 4% to 6% across the five years. Should we think about it linear across the five years or is it more frontend or back-end loaded? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: No, as we said in our prepared remarks, we have designed this plan to deliver within the range every year, both the capital and the recovery mechanisms. Unknown Speaker : I see. Okay. And that's all I have. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll go to [Hassan Jahan with Avila Research Consulting]. Unknown Speaker : Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hey. Unknown Speaker : Couple of questions on the tax issue. One, Steve, I thought what you said was very interesting. If the corporate tax rate goes down, it sounds like you were suggesting that you get to keep that benefit and then take that money and reinvest it in new infrastructure. Is that kind of right or I would've thought that the rates would be reduced to compensate for the lower tax rates? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Well, not necessarily. There's a number of options that can be put forth here as we work with the various stakeholders. But we've had cost, O&M items drop in the past. There's a number of things that can be done. You can reinvest in capital and keep your ROEs the same under the current rates, but advance your infrastructure for customers. You can use situations like this to accelerate amortizations of regulatory assets and things of that nature when an O&M cost declines and keep current rates where they're at. We've done that in the past, so there's a number of strategic opportunities that exist out there. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: And I think the important point... Unknown Speaker : Excellent. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: ...is if customer rates are otherwise going down for a reduction in tax rates, that gives you the opportunity to deploy capital without an increase in . Unknown Speaker : Right. Right. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: So that's the point we're trying to emphasize here. Unknown Speaker : Okay. That's excellent. Gas LDC, M&A, is that something that is still in the mix? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: So this plan does not contemplate M&A. We feel like with the portfolio of businesses that we have that we've got a good growth trajectory. Asset acquisitions, if we saw something that fit with one of the businesses, we of course would be opportunistic. But there's no, what I would call, corporate M&A contemplated here. Unknown Speaker : Got it. Personal tax rates going down, I would assume if that happens, your 4% to 6% growth rate would start to look very low, correct? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: If personal tax rates go down? Unknown Speaker : More money to the consumer, consumers spend more, more household formations, therefore more electric connections and gas connections, no? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: We love load growth. We do. Unknown Speaker : Exactly. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: That's probably the best thing that can happen to our business. Unknown Speaker : Exactly. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: So let's move to the Southeast. Let's build industrial in the Midwest, we're all for it. Unknown Speaker : But first the tax rate has to come down. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: But to the extent the economy picks up based on various tax initiatives, whether corporate or personal and discretionary spending increases, well, that will certainly help our business. And certainly our Southeast jurisdictions are very desirable areas with a lot of growth. We'd love to see that uptick. Unknown Speaker : Got it. And last question, if you're going to Washington to influence the outcome of the tax results, why not push for deduction of dividends? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: That's interesting question because we have that raised by a legislator actually in an early conversation. So, all things are on the table, I guess. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Thank you very much. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And now I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today and for your attention during a slightly longer call and set of prepared remarks. We will be available, as we always are, for additional discussion and feedback, our Investor Relations team, and we look forward to seeing many of you in the days ahead. So thanks again for your investment in Duke Energy. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, again, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you, all, again for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Good day and welcome to the Duke Energy First Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mike Callahan. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Callahan - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you, Noah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Duke Energy's first quarter 2017 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide two presents the Safe Harbor statement which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website and in today's materials. Please note the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. As summarized on slide three, during today's call Lynn will briefly discuss our financial and operational highlights for the quarter. She will also provide an update on the progress we have made against our long-term strategy including additional details about our grid modernization efforts. Steve will then provide an overview of our first quarter financial results, insight about economic and low growth trends, and an update on our regulatory and rate case activity. With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 for the first quarter. We had solid growth in our electric and gas utilities in the quarter driven by our ongoing investment programs. This was offset by the warm winter weather experienced across all of our jurisdictions. We're already taking action in leveraging our agile operations and ability to manage costs to offset the effects of the weather which Steve will discuss in more detail in a moment. With our strongest quarter ahead, we remain on track for 2017 and have affirmed our full year guidance range. Through all of this, our focus on operational excellence has not changed and our commitment to safety is unwavering. Over the last six months, we've welcomed our Piedmont colleagues and I'm proud to share the recent accomplishments in safety and environmental stewardship as outlined on this slide. I may not quite sound like myself today. We're suffering from a spring cold so thanks for your patience and interest in Duke. The integration of Piedmont is well underway and we're pleased with the progress to-date. Merger integration can be a time of uncertainty but our Piedmont teammates have consistently delivered strong operational, financial, and customer performance. We're looking forward to a strong full year contribution from Piedmont in 2017. Let me highlight a couple of very recent successes. In the Midwest, the American Gas Association awarded our Midwest LDCs the 2016 Safety Achievement Award. Our employees had the lowest incident rate for days away from work compared to our peers last year. Also, Piedmont was recognized as an environmental champion for the third consecutive year based on a nationwide survey. This is the result of our efforts to reduce vehicle fleet emissions and make our facilities more energy efficient. These awards are a testament to our industry-leading operational excellence and I'm proud of our employees and their continued focus on safety and efficient operations. As we turn to slide five and six, we thought it would be appropriate to briefly revisit our strategic vision for the company which we discussed with you in February. Our industry is undergoing transformation from increasing customer and stakeholder expectations to rapid technology development and new public policy requirements. The companies that succeed in this environment are those who anticipate and adapt. We see great opportunity in this period of transformation to invest in infrastructure, our customers' value, and deliver sustainable growth for our investors. This strategy defines priorities for us every day, from investments to regulatory and legislative initiatives. Slide six depicts how this vision is manifested and establishes our investment priorities over the next 10 years. We will invest in areas that position us well for the future including strengthening our energy delivery system, generating cleaner energy, and expanding natural gas infrastructure. Everything we do begins with customer service and we also understand that working collaboratively with our stakeholders is critical to our success. On today's call, we want to highlight the investments we're making in the energy delivery system by, first, providing more details on our investment plans and, secondly, by sharing our recent experience in the Carolinas. Turning to slide seven, let me provide more details in our grid investment plan. The energy grid is a critical part of our nation's infrastructure, directly impacting nearly every part of our economy. Duke Energy's grid is the largest in the nation, stretching more than 300,000 miles. We have developed a comprehensive plan to create a smarter delivery system that positions our states for the future, delivering the reliability and services our customers expect. While some tend to think of grid modernization primarily in terms of smart meters, our plan is more comprehensive. Our investments will help us to automatically reroute power and accelerate restoration through new technologies and core infrastructure upgrades. This will add connectivity, capacity, and control to the grid allowing the system to self-identify problems and react automatically to shorten or eliminate outages. Our targeted undergrounding program will replace select sections of poorly performing overhead lines, many located in hard to access areas. Our plan will strengthen the grid as we upgrade transformers, replace aging cable and poles, install additional protective devices, and expand our flood mitigation work. We will also improve the grid's resilience against cyber attacks and physical threats through enhanced system intelligence programs. And to give our customers the tools to help them lower their bills and improve their experience, we are investing in smart meters, communications technologies, and upgraded systems. These investments will help us improve outage detection and better manage new grid devices including distributed generation. Turning to slide eight, let me highlight an important example of recent progress in the Carolinas. In April, we announced our 10-year plan to upgrade and strengthen our energy grid in North Carolina. The initiative called Power/Forward Carolinas will allow us to reduce outages and better serve our customers, helping to keep the lights on and businesses running. But the investment will do more than modernize our energy grid. It will enable more cost-saving solutions, provide additional reliability to customers, and serve as an economic stimulus for North Carolina communities. We commissioned Ernst & Young to study the potential economic impacts of Power/Forward Carolina. According to the study, our investment will create $21.5 billion in economic output over a decade, bring nearly 14,000 direct and indirect jobs to North Carolina, and contribute nearly $1 billion in state and local taxes that will flow directly into local communities to continue making North Carolina one of the top places to live and work. This long-term initiative was announced in April and the response has been positive as we continue to educate our customers and stakeholders on our plan and the benefits it will provide to the region. Our vision is to create a smarter energy grid. We have bold plans and I'm confident in our ability to execute the strategy across our service territories to better serve our customers in the future. Turning now to slide nine, let me take a moment to update you on a few of our nearer-term strategic initiatives that lay the foundation for our future success. Progress continues on smart meter deployment around our system. To-date, we've installed over 2 million smart meters in our utilities including over 1 million in the Carolinas. In Indiana, our grid modernization efforts are well underway as we continue to roll out a smarter network in the state through the TDSIC program. We're also moving forward with our work to generate cleaner energy with our investments in natural gas plants and renewables. Construction of our W.S. Lee, Citrus County, and Western Carolinas combined cycle natural gas plants remain on track and on budget. For more than a decade, we've been working toward a lower carbon future by modernizing and diversifying our system, including retiring older coal plants and building new natural gas plants and renewables. So far, we have reduced carbon emissions by 29% since 2005 and we're committed to advancing these efforts. With the recent release of our latest corporate sustainability report, we've introduced a new ambitious goal. By 2030, we plan to reduce carbon emissions by 40% from the 2005 level. Work also continues in our three interstate natural gas pipelines as we invest in the needed infrastructure to improve access to this cleaner, cheaper fuel. In Florida, the Sabal Trail Pipeline is on track to be in service in June and construction of the lateral to our Citrus County plant remains on time to meet the planned service date. This summer, we expect the final environmental impact statement for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, keeping the project on time to begin construction in the second half of this year. State and local governments in West Virginia, Virginia, and North Carolina continue to support the project as they understand the economic benefit of this critical infrastructure. Final FERC approval is expected by late summer or early fall which will require a quorum on the commission. Regarding the Constitution Pipeline, we continue to believe this FERC-approved project will benefit customers in New York and New England, bringing much needed low-cost natural gas to the region. We're disappointed in the ruling by the U.S. District Court for the northern district of New York which was related to New York state permit requirements. However, we're still pursuing our appeal associated with the Clean Water Act water quality certification. We anticipate a decision on our appeal from the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals as early as the second quarter of this year. And our discussions with stakeholders continue and we will work diligently to complete the project with our partners. In addition, we continue to engage with federal lawmakers and administration officials in Washington as they consider potential reforms to tax and infrastructure policies. We're actively advocating on behalf of our customers and shareholders as we meet with industry organizations such as the [EI] and congressional leaders. We will remain active on key issues facing our industry and support policies that keep customer bills low and spur economic growth while also ensuring the reliability of our system in protecting the environment. We're off to a good start to the year. The fundamentals of our businesses are strong and we have a great team of dedicated employees focused on executing our strategy safely and efficiently. I look forward to updating you throughout the year about additional milestones we reached. Now, let me turn it over to Steve. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thanks, Lynn. Today, I will walk you through the key earnings drivers from the first quarter, discuss current retail volume trends and economic indicators as well as provide an update on regulatory activity underway in several of our jurisdictions. I'll close with a summary of our key investor considerations. Let's start with the quarterly results. I will cover the highlights on slide 10 and discuss our adjusted earnings per share variances compared to the prior year quarter. For a more detailed information on segment variances versus last year and a reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. On a reported or GAAP basis, 2017 first quarter earnings per share were $1.02 compared to $1.01 last year. First quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.04 compared to $1.13 in the first quarter of 2016. Lower results in the current year reflect the absence of International Energy results due to the successful sale of the business in December 2016 and the effects of warm winter weather. Removing the impact of weather, we see strong growth in the regulated businesses and a solid contribution from Piedmont. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure quarterly adjusted results were $0.03 per share, lower quarter-over-quarter. This performance was primarily driven by the warm winter weather that we experienced over the past few months. In fact, this was the second warmest February and sixth warmest winter on record in the U.S, and our service territories in the Carolinas and Midwest set new record warm temperatures. Partially offsetting weather was favorable O&M largely due to lower storm restoration costs in the quarter compared to last year and our ongoing cost management efforts across the business. Our target for 2017 reflected the reduction of non-recoverable O&M cost from 2016 levels and we're well on our way to achieving that goal for the year. In a moment, I will discuss additional cost efficiencies we're implementing to offset the warm winter weather in early 2017. Results were also favorably impacted by higher revenues from energy efficiency riders in the Carolinas and grid investment riders in Ohio and Indiana. Additionally, we had new rates effective in Duke Energy Progress South Carolina and base rate adjustments in Florida. Retail volumes were also higher in the quarter. I'll speak to those results in greater detail in just a moment. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure results were primarily driven by the contribution from Piedmont Natural Gas. For the quarter, Piedmont delivered $0.14 of earnings, excluding financing cost and share dilution. Despite the warm weather, Piedmont's quarterly results were consistent with their plan. Piedmont's LDC business benefited from existing weather normalization mechanisms in South Carolina and Tennessee and margin decoupling in North Carolina. These mechanisms help reduce volatility associated with volumetric change due to weather. In the quarter, our average customer growth for our gas utilities was 1.2%, consistent with our expectations. This was underpinned by a strong customer growth of 1.5% in the Carolinas and Tennessee. Looking ahead, it is important to note that LDCs traditionally earn the majority of their profits in the colder months of the year and very little during the remaining months. Piedmont achieved nearly half of their full year plan in the first quarter and we expect the LDC to deliver the bulk of the remainder in the fourth quarter of this year. Moving on, our Commercial Renewables segment was flat for the quarter. Increased production from new projects brought online in 2016 was offset by lower solar ITCs in the current year. Other was down $0.01 for the quarter. This was driven by higher interest expense at the holding company which was partially offset by increased contributions from our equity investment in National Methanol Company. Finally, recall that we completed the sale of our Latin American generation business in the fourth quarter of 2016, removing $0.17 of earnings from the quarter before consideration of the use of sale proceeds. Cost management continues to be a strong focus for Duke Energy. Our continuous improvement efforts including the use of lean techniques to streamline our business processes and risk management assessments to eliminate low-value work from our operations align our cost structure to the evolving needs of our business. When we experience weaker weather such as that in early 2017, we will look for flexibility in our cost management practices. As Lynn mentioned, we already have additional cost control plans in place and we'll mitigate approximately $100 million of the weather impact in the first quarter. Some of the opportunities we have identified will be sustainable cost reductions providing benefits for both our customers and shareholders for years to come. Given our size and scale, we can execute these efficiency efforts and we're confident in our ability to finish within the targeted range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share. Moving to slide 11. Let's review our retail customer volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather normalized retail load growth was 0.2%. This was largely driven by lower than expected 2016 results in the industrial sector and the loss of leap day in the first quarter of 2016. However, first quarter 2017 results were strong. We achieved growth of 0.1% even with the loss of the leap day in the prior year. Taking that into consideration, sales volumes in the first quarter were up over 1%. One quarter is certainly not a trend, but it is encouraging and aligns with our long-term expectations for approximately 0.005% load growth over our five-year planning horizon. The residential sector grew 0.5% on a rolling 12-month basis driven by strong new customer growth of 1.4% particularly in the Carolinas and Florida. As we've experienced over the past few years, utility-sponsored energy efficiency programs, for which we're compensated, and more energy-efficient building codes and standards continued to partially offset this customer growth. Current trends and new job and wage growth as well as recovery in the housing market are positive signs for continued residential growth. In fact, we've been closely monitoring the recent shift away from starts of multi-family homes to single family homes. New permit applications for single family housing starts are up over 10% across all of our service territories. Commercial sales have improved by 0.5% across our jurisdictions over the past quarter and is up 0.6% over the rolling 12 months. Non-manufacturing employment continues to strengthen and office vacancies continue to decline across many of our service territories. In addition, we're seeing positive trends related to leisure activities including entertainment and restaurants. Turning to the industrial sector. Though the class is down 0.6% on a rolling 12-month basis, industrial performance in the quarter was strong with 0.8% growth. Industries that support construction and housing continue to do well. This strength is partially offset by industries that are more dependent on global trade given that the U.S. dollar remains strong. However, we're cautiously optimistic about the continued recovery of global economies as well as the resurgence of business investment. We will continue to closely monitor economic conditions and our customer usage patterns and update you throughout the remainder of the year. Before closing, I want to highlight key regulatory activities underway in a few of our jurisdictions as highlighted on slide 12. In Florida, we have completed filings for the Osprey gas-fired plant that we acquired in January and our completed Hines Chiller upgrade project. Both of these filings were made under the generation base rate adjusted mechanism and were approved with new rates effective in February and April, respectively. In Indiana, we completed our second semi-annual filing under the TDSIC rider for the next installment of costs covering the period July through December 2016. TDSIC-1 was filed last October and approved in March with rates effective April 2017. On May 2, we filed our 30-day advanced notice with the North Carolina Utility Commission for our upcoming DEP rate case. We anticipate filing the notice for the rate case at DEC later this summer. New rates associated with these cases are likely to be effective in the first half of 2018. I'll close with slide 13.

With that, let's open the lines for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll pause for a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions. And we'll take our first question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning, Jonathan. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I have a question about the Carolinas grid plan, the $13 billion. Is the $4.9 billion of undergrounding reasonable for the proxy for the proportion to hold the $25 billion broader plan that would be from undergrounding or is that sort of more specific to this piece of it? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Jonathan, if you're referring to slide eight... Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. I think so. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Yeah. That's the Carolina view. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. So if we look at the $25 billion, would the $4.9 billion sort of scale proportionately? Lee T. Mazzocchi - Duke Energy Corp.: So it would not scale exactly proportionate. This is Lee Mazzocchi with the Grid Solutions group. We found that our heaviest concentration of densely vegetated lands that cause outages are really preponderantly in the Carolinas. We do have investments in Florida and the Midwest but they're not quite to the scale and the magnitude of what we're seeing in the Carolinas in the $25 billion. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So it's almost 40% of the Carolinas plan, that's what prompted the question. Lee T. Mazzocchi - Duke Energy Corp.: You would see it less than 40% in the other jurisdictions. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just conceptually, how are you proposing that that would be socialized? Is it locally to the communities that sort of benefit from it or is that more across the whole system? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Jonathan, we think there is a basis to treat this like any electric plant and service, and treat it as a rate base item. And what we're planning to do or are doing is using data analytics to identify the sections of our service areas that are affected by this, and that then has an implication to lowering our outage and outage costs which we believe all of our customers will benefit from. So it's a long-term investment around the improved reliability of the total system and we believe it brings great customer benefits and, of course, benefits to investors as well. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That makes sense. Great. Thank you. Other than FERC, what else do you need to move forward on ACP, if anything? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: So, Jonathan, there are other permits. Water processing permits, for example, in the states and we are working actively with all of the states to progress those permits on a timeline consistent with the FERC approval. And so we feel like we're on track with the timeline that we've laid out for you. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then if I may. I think last quarter's call, when you sort of hinted that if you execute well on the plan the upper end of the guidance range could be in scope, I think the growth rate is based off the midpoint of the 2017 guidance. Having had this slower start to 2017, is that still something you think you can get to with cost offsets and the like or that's the case now? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Jonathan, we remain on track. I mean, this is three months of a year against a five-year plan. The actions that we've identified for 2017 are really consistent with actions that we've taken when you have variability around weather. And so we've identified about $100 million and we'll continue executing on that on 2017. And then the investments that will ultimately drive growth are something that'll build over time, and we've given you some visibility on what those look like and where they're located and we're executing on all them. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Steve mentioned some of $100 million might flow through would be sustainable, I think was the word he used. Can you be sort of more specific as to what percentage of it? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: At this point I think it's pretty immature to get that granular, Jonathan. So when we go after costs, we're always looking for things that can be sustainable but also recognize just flexibility within the year can be helpful. So it's a combination of both. I don't have any more specifics that I'd share with you at this point. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Well thanks very much. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin with UBS. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Julien. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Perhaps just to elaborate a little bit on the last question. On the cost offsets here for the first quarter, I think you said about $100 million or so. Does that have any kind of ongoing benefit or is that really kind of a transient phenomenon? I think you suggested the former. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Well I think it will have an ongoing benefit. I think many of these costs are accelerations of the cost efficiency efforts that are underway, so I think many of them will be sustainable. It's hard to define precisely at this point. But I would also discuss and mention last year, in 2016, we came out of the gate with storms and low volumes and we accelerated cost reductions of $100 million. Then when the weather came in the third quarter, we moved some work into 2016. So that type of dexterity can go both ways but, certainly, many of the cost reductions in 2016, and I think many that we're doing in 2017, will be sustainable throughout our five-year plan. It's hard to be granular at this point given the flexibility that we try to exercise. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Right. So just to be clear about this. This is basically fungible with the wider cost reductions you've been contemplating in the five-year program, right? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: That's certainly part of it. Absolutely. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Julien, what I would add to that is I think this point of cost flexibility is what we want to emphasize with this. So we believe we have the scale and the expertise from the work that we've done over a number of years to be flexible with cost management. And every time we go after cost in a given area we're always working to make it sustainable, and in that event it could be incremental to some of the things we've shared with you previously. But I think the expertise that we're developing around cost management is really fundamental to the business, and we had a good track record of executing. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Follow-up question here on coal ash if I can. Really just kind of curious. Are your plans at all changed given the shift in what seems like ELGs and CCRs at the federal level? I imagine not but I just wanted to clarify that. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: At this point, our plans are moving forward, Julien, and you can think about at least the North Carolina business is having an implication not only from CCR but from CAMA, the laws in North Carolina. And so we're on track. We don't have any specific change of plans just to resolve all of these new executive actions. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And lastly, can you give us a little bit of a sense of what kind of size of rate increase that we're talking about as a function of the forthcoming cases in North Carolina? Do you have a sense yet and how that might net against cost? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Well on the increase, and maybe get to that second one in a second, Julien. On the increase, we'll share more specifics when we file for the increase which will be in about a month for DEP and then there'll be a notice and then a filing for DEC. So we'll, at that time, be in a position to give you more specifics on the composition of the filing as well as the percentage increase. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. All right. Fair enough. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thanks. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, guys. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Hello. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning. Hey, I was wondering if you could give kind of an update on legislative initiatives within the Carolinas especially as to how they might be interacting with your presenting of this plan on April 12. Is it all integrated into one kind of public push with legislators to get more riders in place going forward? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: So, Mike, we continue to engage with our stakeholders here in the Carolinas about our priorities and, certainly, regulatory modernization that fits the nature of the investments we're planning to make in the delivery system are a part of those discussions, as are renewables and integration of renewables into our system. So it's really early in the legislative session at this point, but there could still be some opportunities in the current session and we'll share milestones when appropriate. And in the backdrop, as you know, of all of these, the rate case filings that will also occur in 2017 in the Carolinas. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Right. I guess with 13,900 jobs projected for 10 years, are you getting support from any specific groups enough for that kind of program or...? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Mike, I think there's a lot of interest in infrastructure investment and job creation. I think that's in the Carolinas as well as around the U.S. And this represents really important infrastructure and gives North Carolina an opportunity to lead the way on infrastructure investment. And I think job creation particularly in the eastern part of the state that has been hampered economically is very attractive. So we believe this plan is a win-win for customers, for investors, and for communities. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. And just one last question. Is there any change to load growth guidance at all for electric load growth or even on the gas side? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: No. Our growth assumptions, I think, for our five-year planning horizon of 0.005%, I think those are still the viable and right place to be at this point in time. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Switching gears. You've made significant proposals in the state of North Carolina with regard to how PURPA is being used by solar developers to get contracts for large utility-scale solar. I'm not sure whether the commission has actually made a decision on the things that you've requested be changed in the way that you're forced to sign these types of PURPA contracts. Can you review for people because I think this is a little under the radar for some? What has been going on with regard to PURPA as it relates to solar in North Carolina, what you're asking for to be changed, and where will we stand in that process? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Sure. So, Greg, there are couple of things going on. In the regulatory arena, we made an avoided cost filing which addresses the price, the term, the size of these facilities, and that went to hearing in mid-April. There is, of course, the position of the other parties and the public staff in North Carolina has testimonies that I think would be helpful for investors to take a look at. And really what's being proposed is an opportunity to move this development of renewables and solar in the state into a more sustainable model. So in addition to size and price that we're pursuing on the regulated front, we're also having discussions in the general assembly about the development of a competitive process on an annual basis with a determined size that would give solar developers and also the utility an opportunity to plan. We also think a competitive process would impact price to customers and believe that better planning and better pricing would create a more sustainable market. And so there are two things to track here, not only the regulatory proceedings, avoided cost, went to hearing in April \u2013 that's moving through as procedural process \u2013 but also continued discussions in the legislature about sustainable solar development in the state of North Carolina. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : The bottom line is that \u2013 and this is me summarizing it, not you -the solar developers have been using PURPA as an opportunity to get above market contracts and you're looking for a process that's more transparent so you can be more comfortable, that you're not burdening your customers with solar contracts that are not economic relative to market. Is that fair? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Greg, I think that's fair. We've done some calculations of the prices implied in these contracts, and we believe it's costing customers about $1 billion more than a market price would cost them over a 12-year period. And this notion of better planning and better pricing, we believe, can create more certainty not only for the solar industry but better pricing for customers, and I think that's important as this market continues to develop. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Michael. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Hey, Mike. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Real quickly. On the capital budget for the next few years, you've made a few announcements in just the last few months, even one or two since you reported fourth quarter of 2016. Just curious, any significant changes to the capital budget over the next few years? And if so, which jurisdictions? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: No significant changes, Michael, over the next five years. Some of the timing may be a bit different. But we've got a capital plan, $45 billion to $50 billion over the five years, and that's where it's going to be at at this point. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then just curious, Lynn. How are you thinking about the opportunities at the renewable business, and how the growth over the next couple of years will look relative to the substantial number of megawatts you added over the last two to three years? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Michael, when we put forward our plans in February there's a shift in the renewable investment more toward regulated investment than commercial, and we think that just makes good sense for not only investors but customers in our jurisdictions. So we have about $2.5 billion in the five-year plan; about $1.5 billion sits in the jurisdictions and $1 billion in commercial. And so I think we've shared with you that we're looking at that commercial investment very closely. Returns are tight, the tax position is uncertain for us at least over the next couple of years, and we'll continue to make the right decisions about deploying capital in that commercial business as we see returns that fit our expectations. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And are there opportunities with that renewable business regarding either, potentially, to add more via less on the development side and more via on the acquisition of whole portfolios? Or on the flip side, is your portfolio potentially more valuable and have you assessed that in the hands of, maybe, other parties? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Well, Michael, we continue to look at what we own, its value and contribution as well as what it might command on the outside. So those are ongoing assessments that we do. We feel like we have a really strong portfolio of 3,000 megawatts wind and solar, backed by a long-term contract. And so those are assessments that are ongoing but nothing specific to share with you today on a strategic analysis or initiative that we're considering. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you. Much appreciated. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Praful Mehta with Citi. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. Hi, guys. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. So firstly on the holding company debt. You continue to have a target of about 35% holdco debt to total debt for 2017. I just wanted to understand. Given tax reform expected to come at least, is there any view that you want to, over time, reduce that number or how are you looking at that? And if there is any goal to reduce it, what levers or tools do you have to bring down that holding company debt over time? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Well, Praful, when you look at our five-year plan, you do see over the five years the holding company debt level does decrease. Our credit metrics improve over the five-year plan. We're still issuing holding company debt because we're growing over that five-year period but the ratio to total debt does decline. So that's part of our five-year plan that we've baked in under current tax laws. Now regarding tax reform, it's hard to say where that's going. Proposals are still in very early stages. It hasn't gotten very far. We'll continue to keep our eye on that and we've been assessing other scenarios and other ways to finance if that were to change significantly. But overall, we feel good about our balance sheet and our ability to deal with the holding company debt. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Thanks. And then secondly in terms of the cost saving initiatives. It seems like it's almost dry powder that you used to offset any weather impacts. I wanted to understand if that's a fair characterization, and if it is why not do more? As in, why not do more rather than wait for weather and use it as dry powder? I'm just trying to understand how you kind of think about the cost savings. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Praful, I would suggest that we've been very aggressive on cost savings. If you look at the track record of Duke, we've had flat O&M for a number of years and are projecting flat through 2020. We think that's aggressive and we continue to focus on ways we can drive costs out of the business, and that is our job every day. But what we're talking about here is flexibility as a result of weather where we may make some decisions in a short-term basis in order to offset weather. It could be holding a vacancy, it could be working with a contractor differently, things of that sort. But you should take away that we understand the assignment of being very aggressive with our cost structure and we are achieving that with initiatives throughout the company. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Thank you, guys. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks. First question, Lynn or Steve. Can you remind us? When you talk about the 4% to 6% CAGR in earnings, is that fairly linear? Or given the timing of rate cases and rate increase, there is a lumpiness factored into that as well? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Ali, we shared in February that every year we'll be within the range, that we've developed a plan that puts every year within the range. And so I think that's the way I would respond to that question. And we will have rate cases in 2017 that are important to 2018 and we'll give you more update on those milestones as we go forward. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then overall, just remind us, perhaps, on an LTM basis as well what's the current regulatory lag in the system and where within your jurisdictions are you seeing the biggest lag right now? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Ali, we had talked about regulatory lag over the past couple of years, and it'll vary depending upon the timing of base rate cases that we'll see. But we see most of our regulatory lag in the Carolinas jurisdiction where you have recovery mechanisms through riders or decouplings, similar to what we see in our gas business at Piedmont, you have less lag. And we're trying to work to minimize lag through various initiatives in our regulatory jurisdictions. Most of the lag, I would say, is in the Carolinas jurisdictions at this point in time. Again, it's hard to put a specific number on it in terms of how much it'll pull down in any given year. Specifically, it'll just depend upon the timing of rate cases. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. And, Steve, as you look at that five-year CapEx plan and the funding of it, when at the earliest should we be thinking about equity coming back into the picture from a funding perspective? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Our five-year plan contemplates the use of a DRIP starting in 2018 throughout the remainder of the plan, and we estimate that to be in the ballpark of $350 million a year. So that's in our base plan. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I see, okay. And last question, also remind us. Within the commercial earnings and net income right now, roughly how much of that is recognition of tax credits? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Ali, I would say the majority of the tax credits. If you think about it, it's primarily a renewables business. PTCs are the lion's share of it because our portfolio is primarily wind. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: So PTCs more than ITCs? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Yes. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yes. That's correct. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Wow. I got a question. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hello, Andy. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Hello, Andy. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: How are you guys doing. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: We're good. How are you? Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: I'm doing all right. It's kind of cold here, though. What can we do. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: It's warm out here. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Still kind of spring winter. Hey, just a couple of very, very quick questions. On the cost savings that you did this quarter, is there like a breakdown? I don't expect you to have it specifically, but is the majority in a certain jurisdiction or is it kind of across the board? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: The delta on the O&M this quarter, Andy, I would think about as being across the board. But the one thing you should note, that first quarter of 2016 had a lot of storm restoration in it. That was primarily Carolinas, so the delta over the quarter is being influenced by that. The $100 million as we go forward over the balance of the year, you can think about that as being across the company. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Okay. But the $100 million is exclusive to the storm restoration change? Is that correct or not? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: That's not correct. So two things I would point to. If you look at our actual versus actual announcements for the first quarter, O&M is the positive driver. And that positive driver is primarily the result of the fact that 2016 had storms in it and 2017 doesn't. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Okay. Because I guess what I was trying to figure out was not all of the \u2013 and I think Julien had asked the question, too, but I think you forgot to answer the last part of it. As you think about the rate cases you're going to file in the Carolinas, I guess in this case for the quarter and depending on when the test year is, obviously you've had a lot of cost savings. So to the benefit of the customers, those cost savings will be passed on and that'll lessen the blow of any type of rate increase. But I guess also even this $100 million or the cost that you achieved in the first quarter, that actually is offset by the storm restoration that you did. Did you collect the storm restoration or you didn't? Do you understand what I'm getting at? I'm just trying to figure out \u2013 again, I know we have to wait for your rate case to be filed \u2013 but I would assume there's some good cost to offset the increase. Is that correct? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yeah. Let me try to... Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: And how should we think about that? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yeah. Let me perhaps give some clarity on a few things. We'll file for these rate cases with a 2016 test year and then there are other things you make to that. And you try to look at sometimes normalized cost levels within that, looking at storms and so forth. So I don't think you can draw a definitive conclusion about a cost level in a particular period of time and what it might mean. I would say the ongoing cost efforts that we have to reduce costs, they offset salary increases, inflation, and so forth. So if you recall, in February we talked about our goal is to keep our non-fuel O&M flat through 2020 and we think we can do that and, in fact, reduce it a bit here in 2017. So I'd look at costs more holistically in that way, that we're keeping them flat and maybe slightly reducing them as well, offsetting a lot of the inflationary and salary increase impacts. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: And Andy, on the storms, you may remember we filed a deferral request. It's not Hurricane Matthew and Jonas and Hermine. I mean, there were a number of storms impacting. And that deferral request will be a part of this rate case in the Carolinas. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Got it. That's very helpful. And then my last question is just kind of basic for both of you and just how you're thinking, and I understand what you're saying about equity going forward. But with your stock price doing very well at $0.82, $0.87 at the moment, down $0.05 just to give you a report. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: And then you look at, like, PPO kind of decided to fix their balance sheet a little bit because their stock price has been doing well. I guess it's one of the reasons. There are other reasons, too. And the stock actually is up 13.5% this year even though they decided to issue incremental equity. And so I guess what I'm trying to get at is because if I kind of ran the numbers and doing a mid-sized equity offering now would actually help you on your credit metrics \u2013 and I'm talking about more of the balance sheet, not your FFO and the debt, obviously \u2013 and it would be kind of a one-day type event. Why not kind of go now and try to kind of take down some of that parent debt and issue some equity since, obviously, you have a lot of CapEx? I mean, you understand what I'm getting at. I'm not going to just keep going, but just kind of what's the big thinking of that, with the stock prices so high? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Yeah. Steve may have something to share on this as well, but we are very comfortable with our balance sheet. We believe the portfolio transition and the businesses that we own are very low risk. We have an improving profile in our balance sheet as a result of the strength of this plan. We believe the DRIP is an effective way to issue equity that matches the deployment of capital over time. So we always evaluate financing techniques but believe this is the most appropriate one given where we are. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Okay. And Steve, do you have anything to say or we're good? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: No. We're good. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Okay. Thank you, guys. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Andy, thank you. All right. Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium: Have a great Mother's Day, Lynn. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you, Andy. Operator : And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Well thank you, everyone, for joining today and for your interest in investing in Duke Energy. We look forward to seeing many of you over the next several months, and we'll continue to keep you updated on our key milestones. Thanks again for joining. Operator : And that does concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

Analysts: Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Operator : Good day and welcome to the Duke Energy Second Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mike Callahan. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Callahan - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Duke Energy's second quarter 2017 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide two presents the Safe Harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website and in today's materials. Please note the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. As summarized on slide three, during today's call Lynn will briefly discuss our financial and operational highlights for the quarter. She will also provide an update on our efforts to achieve timely cost recovery in North Carolina, how we continue to transform the customer experience, and the progress we have made on our strategic investments. Steve will then provide an overview of our second quarter financial results and insight about our economic and low growth trends. He will also provide more details about our North Carolina rate cases before closing with our key investor considerations. With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.01 for the second quarter. These results reflect strong execution in driving growth, managing cost and making progress on our strategic investment priorities. We remain on track to deliver our full year earnings guidance range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share. During the quarter, we also increased our quarterly dividend by 4.1%, in line with our policy to grow dividends consistent with our long-term growth in earnings. This marks the 91st consecutive year we've paid a cash dividend to our investors. Turning to operations, we've continued to pursue excellence in everything we do. The second quarter is an important quarter for nuclear outages. Over the last two years, our nuclear leadership team has been focused on driving greater productivity into our outage performance. That work is delivering results. In McGuire Station, we completed a 23-day unit outage, a new record for McGuire. And at our Catawba Station, the team completed an outage in 24 days, five days ahead of schedule. These efforts are consistent with our strategy to find additional efficiencies in our processes and more effectively manage outage timelines. Our Edwardsport plant is also setting new operational records. Gasifier availability has improved to over 85% year-to-date. The plant is also in the midst of a record-setting run of more than 200 consecutive days, an increase of nearly 20% over the prior station record. As a result of the strong operational performance, electric generation has exceeded the prior year by more than 8%. In addition, EEI recently presented us their Excellence Award for Supplier Diversity, highlighting our focus on collaborating with a diverse set of vendors and suppliers as we advance our long-term strategy. And Piedmont Natural Gas was named America's second most trusted utility among residential customers, according to a nationwide survey. These results demonstrate the dedication and commitment of our employees. I want to thank them for their focus on safe operations by serving (4:02) our customers with reliable energy every day. Moving to slide 5, I wanted to spend a few minutes highlighting progress on our strategy; investing in infrastructure our customers value, and delivering sustainable growth. This slide outlines the underlying investment priorities, strengthening and modernizing the energy grid, generating cleaner energy, and expanding our natural gas infrastructure. Importantly, it also highlights key foundational elements to our success : customer focus and stakeholder engagement. Today, I will update you on work underway on these two foundational elements, focusing on House Bill 589 and the customer experience, followed by an update on our strategic investment priorities. Slide 6 includes a summary of recently enacted legislation, House Bill 589, also known as the Competitive Energy Solutions for North Carolina Act. This legislation provides a strong example of stakeholder engagement and progress, and achieving timely investment recovery in North Carolina. It outlines a thoughtful, rational approach to renewables growth that supports our commitment to deliver reliable and cleaner energy to customers and timely returns to investors, and it has the broad support of a wide range of stakeholders. The law reforms the PURPA process, and helps integrate new renewable generation in a way that balances reliability and affordability. It will now allow costs associated with standard contracts for Qualified Facilities to be recovered through the state's fuel costs. It also creates a competitive bidding process for approximately 2,600 megawatts of utility-scale renewable energy projects. Duke Energy will have an opportunity to participate with self-build projects, up to a 30% cap. However, utilities may also acquire projects from third parties, and these acquisitions are not subject to the cap. The law also allows for the recovery of costs associated with these projects through a new rider to be established by the Commission. The competitive bidding process will ensure that new renewables are brought on to the system at market-based rates, delivering nearly $1 billion in savings for our customers over the next decade. It will support the continued growth in renewables in a market-driven and customer-focused way, and provide an opportunity for additional utility-owned investment by our Carolinas utility. This legislative accomplishment demonstrates the importance of stakeholder support and collaboration. We continue to lay the foundation to advance a broader public policy agenda in North Carolina that supports a healthy, robust, energy market through energy grid investment. Strengthening and modernizing the grid will deliver tremendous benefits to our customers, while also creating thousands of new jobs and putting millions of dollars right back into our local communities through new economic development. Our agenda will include both legislative and regulatory initiatives. Turning to slide 7, as we implement our vision for Duke, the customer is at the center of all we do, enhancing their experience is a strategic part of our infrastructure investment strategy. Work is underway to expand customer control, convenience, and choices about their energy experience. Examples include programs such as Pick Your Own Due Date (sic) [Pick Your Due Date] and Prepaid Advantage. Customers can select a billing due date that fits their personal preferences. Prepaid Advantage is a pilot program that allows customers to choose the amount, date, and frequency at which they prepay for their energy services. Customers with smart meters now also receive energy usage alerts, minimizing surprises when their bill arrives. And smart meters will also allow us to enhance our existing outage awareness communication. Finally, as outlined on this slide, we are launching a new Duke Energy customer app in early 2018. The app will provide real-time personalized updates, giving our customers more control over their energy usage and enhancing their interactions with Duke Energy. Our customers expect customized solutions, and we're expanding our services to meet and exceed their expectations. Turning to slide eight, I want to highlight a few of our strategic investments. In the second quarter, we advanced our plans to install smart meters across our service areas. The Kentucky Public Service Commission approved our plans to deploy smart meters to our Northern Kentucky electric customers. This will add to the more than 2 million meters we have already installed across our service territories. We're also making progress with our investments in low carbon natural gas plants and renewables. Our W.S. Lee, Citrus County and Western Carolinas combined cycle natural gas plants are progressing on schedule and remain on budget. And we're advancing our proposed expansion of our Lincoln Combustion Turbine site using state-of-the-art Siemens technology. Also in mid-July, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved our contract to move forward with a combined heat and power project with Clemson University. Shifting to our gas business, we've reached significant milestones for two of our natural gas pipeline projects. FERC issued the Final Environmental Impact statement for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline on July 21st. Federal and state permitting efforts are proceeding in parallel and are on track. We look forward to the confirmation of the current FERC appointees to ensure a quorum. This will allow the Commission to issue the final project certificate this fall, keeping the project on target for an in-service state in the second half of 2019. As of July 3, the Sabal Trail main line is now in service, delivering much needed natural gas to the Southeast region. We are also on track to complete the lateral to our new Citrus County combined-cycle plant in October. We continue to work through the permitting process for the proposed Constitution Pipeline project. We anticipate that the Second Circuit Court of Appeals decision will be issued soon. In light of this delay, the targeted in-service date has been revised to as early as the first half of 2019. Natural gas will play a major role on our continued growth, and we're committed to expanding our infrastructure to meet our customers' needs. In closing, we're now halfway through 2017 and building momentum for the future. We remain on track to deliver current year results. We are also maintaining a strong focus on our strategic priorities, our customers, the energy grid, generating clean energy, developing gas infrastructure and ongoing stakeholder engagements. We are excited about the progress and growth we see in our business and remain committed to the foundation of our success, safety and operational excellence. Now, let me turn the call over to Steve. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thanks, Lynn. Today, I will walk you through the key drivers from the second quarter, discuss current retail volume trends, and update you on economic indicators. I will also provide an overview of our recently filed rate case for Duke Energy Progress North Carolina. I'll close with the summary of our key investor considerations. Let's start with the quarterly results. I will cover the highlights on slide nine and discuss our adjusted earnings per share variances compared to the prior year quarter. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year, and a reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany in today's press release and presentation. On a reported or GAAP basis, 2017 second quarter earnings per share were $0.98 compared to $0.74 last year. Second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.01 compared to $1.07 in the second quarter of 2016. Lower results in the current year reflect the absence of International Energy, which contributed $0.05 in the prior year quarter, and the effects of less favorable weather. Absent these factors, we saw solid growth across each of our operating segments. Electric Utilities & Infrastructure quarterly adjusted results were up $0.03 per share quarter-over-quarter. This performance was primarily driven by higher retail revenues from increased pricing in riders, and stronger retail volumes. I'll discuss the individual drivers of volume growth by customer class in just a moment. Regulatory pricing is higher as a result of the recent activity in our DEP South Carolina utility, and from generation base rate adjustments in Florida. As for riders, we are seeing incremental growth in our Indiana and Ohio grid investment riders, and utility-sponsored energy efficiency riders in the Carolinas. We continue to manage cost across the business. Finding additional efficiencies and optimizing our resources, we are on track to meet our O&M savings goals for the year, exhibiting flexibility to mitigate the unfavorable weather in the first quarter. We've made great progress today, and we'll continue to work hard managing costs in the second half of the year. Gas Utilities & Infrastructure results were primarily driven by our ongoing investments in the Atlantic Coast and Sabal Trail pipelines. As expected, the LDC results were flat in the quarter and we continue to expect these businesses to provide the bulk of their remaining earnings contribution in the fourth quarter. Moving on, our Commercial Renewables segment was up $0.02 for the quarter. Increased wind resource and production from new projects brought on line in 2016 were partially offset by lower solar ITCs in the current year. Other was down $0.07 for the quarter. This was driven by higher tax expense, primarily due to a prior year favorable IRS resolution and higher interest expense at the holding company from the Piedmont acquisition financing. Based on our results to date and expectations for the second half of the year, we are on track to finish within our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share. Turning to slide 10, I'll review our retail volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather-normalized retail electric load was 0.6%, driven by improvement across all customer classes. Excluding the impact of the leap day in the prior year, our rolling 12-month volume growth would have been 0.9%. Building upon our first quarter trends, growth in the second quarter was 1.2%. The solid results for the first half of the year and the rolling 12 months align with our long-term expectations for approximately one-half of 1% load growth over our five-year planning horizon. The residential sector grew 2.5% in the quarter, and 1% on a rolling 12-month basis, as our attractive service territories continue to experience new customer growth. This is particularly true in the Carolinas and Florida, where we are seeing residential customer growth of 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively. Our combined gas utilities are also adding new customers at an annual rate of 1.3%. The Piedmont service territories are growing at 1.6%, with very strong growth of almost 2% in the Nashville Metro area. As we look ahead, trends in new job and wage growth, and continued recovery in the housing market, are positive signs for ongoing residential growth. We continue to see a trend of increasing single-family building permits across all of our service territories, and a decline in the starts of multi-family homes. As of May, the Southeastern states that Duke serves in, our electric and gas utilities rank among the top seven states in the country for growth in single-family building permits. In all, eight of the top 25 metro areas for growth in single-family permits are cities within Duke service territories. During the second quarter, commercial sales across our jurisdictions improved by 0.4%, and are up 0.8% over the rolling 12 months. As we experience growth in the residential class, we see corresponding growth in related commercial businesses, such as hotels and restaurants. Even with the addition of new office space in our service areas, vacancies continue to decline, demonstrating positive signs for growth in this sector. Turning to industrials on a rolling 12-month basis, the sector declined 0.2%. However, quarterly performance was strong for the second quarter in a row, with 0.7% growth in Q2. Industries that support sales to consumers, such as construction and housing, continue to perform well. This strength is partially offset by the metals and auto manufacturing sectors. As we look to the remainder of the year, we are cautiously optimistic about the continued strength in industrials, as the job market remains robust and industrial production advances. We will continue to closely monitor economic conditions and our customer usage patterns, and we'll update you throughout the remainder of the year. Before closing, I want to highlight a few of the key drivers for the pending rate case in our Duke Energy Progress North Carolina utility, as highlighted on slide 11. On June 1, we filed a request with the North Carolina Utilities Commission to increase revenues by $477 million for Duke Energy Progress. This is our first rate case in this jurisdiction since 2013. Since the prior rate case, we have made significant investments in new generation facilities to meet the needs of a growing customer base, and transition to a low-carbon future. These facilities include new solar generation, highly efficient natural gas-fired units at our Sutton site, and amount spent to-date on our new Western Carolinas Modernization Project. In addition, we are seeking to recover investments required to comply with federal and state environmental regulations. These include a wastewater treatment system at our Mayo coal-fired facility, and expenses incurred to safely close our ash basins. We have also requested to include an estimate of the ongoing cost associated with ash basin closure efforts, based on actual spend in 2016. And the amount spent above or below this estimate will be deferred to a future rate case. This approach would allow us to recover our estimated costs as incurred, reducing our financing costs and ultimately benefiting our retail customers. If approved, this will build upon the recent third quarter, allowing both the EC and the EP to recover costs for coal ash remediation from wholesale customers. We believe this was a prudent approach to managing these expenses and maintaining competitive rates for our customers. Looking ahead, intervenor testimony is due on October 20, and the hearings will begin on November 20. Under this schedule, new rates could go into effect on February 1, 2018. Also, in North Carolina, we submitted our notice to the NCUC that Duke Energy Carolinas intends to file a rate case on or about August 25. Similar to Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Carolinas has not had a rate case since 2013. Detailed information will be available when we make the full filing later this month. I'll close with slide 12, a reminder of our attractive investor value proposition. Duke Energy's large regulated franchises and diverse investment opportunities provide balanced growth in earnings and reliable dividends over time. We are well positioned to deliver growth in earnings and dividends in a low risk, predictable and transparent way, providing an attractive risk-adjusted shareholder return for our investors. As a capital intensive business, our growth is supported by the scale and strength of our balance sheet. In May, Moody's changed their outlook for Duke Energy Corporation to stable from negative, and affirmed our current ratings at the holding company and subsidiaries, further validating our approach to managing the balance sheet. We remain focused on maintaining the strength for the benefit of our customers and investors. In short, our attractive yield and demonstrated ability to reliably grow our regulated businesses positions Duke Energy as the leading infrastructure investment. With that, let's open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Mike Weinstein with Credit Suisse Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, guys. How are you doing? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Hello, Mike. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning, Mike. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning. Could you talk a little bit about the status of legislation in North Carolina, and where you think that might be going, and what kind of timeline you might be expecting on that? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hey, Mike, we're really pleased with the H.B. 589 that we referenced on the call. This was very constructive, I think really a win-win piece of legislation, culminating from a 10-month stakeholder process, and bringing not only the opportunity for growth but reduction of cost to customers, improving reliability and opportunities for additional investment for Duke. So we see it as a demonstrated milestone for us as we continue to advance legislative initiatives in the Carolinas. As you know, additional investment around the grid remains the priority for us, and we have laid a very strong foundation in this legislative session on the compelling business case for customers, and also the case for job creation in North Carolina, and look for ways that we can continue to advance that agenda, not only in the legislature but in the regulatory arena as well. So we see 2017 as being a year that we made great progress and more to come. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And also with the PURPA reforms test, when do you expect to see maybe some additional opportunities coming from that? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: There is a procedural schedule that goes with the legislation, Mike, where we need to make a series of filings. So think about this as beginning in 2018 generally. This does represent additional investment opportunities for us in renewables which we'll evaluate carefully along with all of the other capital opportunities that we have. But we see it as a very constructive piece of legislation benefiting customers, and also creating a sustainable renewable market here in the Carolina. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So perhaps, maybe we'll see some more info on that next February. Is that in the next CapEx update? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Sure. Certainly, we'll give you an update on CapEx in 2018, and we'll continue to develop this opportunity, Mike, even between now and then. So you can think about us as looking for ways throughout all of our jurisdictions to continue to deploy capital. And this represents another opportunity that provides investors with visibility on what's possible, and we think, underpins our growth rate for the future. So we look at this as a very significant milestone for us. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: All right. Great. Thank you very much. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Greg Gordon from Evercore. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thank you. Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning, Greg. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Congratulations on the legislation. It's clearly a win for customers by lowering their costs, and also a win for you guys being able to participate if you can bring in competitive projects. So congrats on that. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : On the rate case, you indicated we won't be getting any details on the Duke Energy Carolinas filing until further little while now. But what was the date again at which we'll be able to sort of analyze the ask (25:05) there? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Greg, it will later in August. So we typically file notice 30 days before the case is filed. That's the process here in North Carolina. Soon we (25:15) file notice late July, you'll hear more in late August. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. And can we talk a little bit about the ask (25:22) and the Duke Energy Progress case? I know it's early days in your filing, and you'll be engaging with all the major parties in the case as we go through time. But the headline, increase is 14%, that's a pretty substantial number. Now, I also understand that you haven't filed a rate case in many years, and so that's a cumulative of having been away from rate filings for a while, and the fact that you've put a substantial amount of capital to work, which you deserve recovery for. But still, it's just a very large number. So can you talk about sort of how you socialize that, especially in the context of a lot of the growth capital that you've talked about related to grid modernization isn't even in this case, it's going to be in subsequent sort of future negotiations with Commission. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Greg, it's a fair question, and I would point to a couple of things on this. It's been several years since we've been in. One thing you shall notice that's not in the case is very aggressive cost management. So we've been able to deliver consistent and deliberate cost management to offset impacts to customers. And as we think about moving this case through the process, we'll also engage with stakeholders, as you referenced, to reach a settlement, if we can do that or to have good constructive discussions on how we move forward. So we've got strong capital in here for things like the Sutton Plant and new solar, and we also have investments in the Western Carolina Modernization Project, which has been strongly supported here in the Carolinas, and of course, coal ash. So I think we have a demonstrated record. If you look at the way we've approached the rate cases in this state, really in every state we operate in; bringing people together to come up with a solution that works for customers and investors will ultimately be our objective, and I believe the Commission as well, finding that right balance between customers and investors. So we will work this as we've worked every case, and I have confidence that we'll deliver an outcome that makes sense for both customers and investors. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Great. And can you just refresh our memories traditionally, if there was an opportunity for settlement, that sort of what window in the case does that usually avail itself? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: I would look to kind of that October, mid-October to mid-November timeframe, Greg, for the DEP case. The procedural schedule has the hearing set for November 20. Testimony occurs kind of in that last month before the hearing. And so that's the point where you start to see the positions of the parties, and you create an opportunity to sit down and have discussions. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Perfect. Thank you. Have a great day. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, guys. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Jonathan. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. So we just wondered, you cited ACP as one of the drivers in the quarter, increased investment. Can you share how much you've invested to date and \u2013 prior to things getting moving? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yes. We've got about $500 million invested in ACP at this point. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And so that's the rate base number, effectively, that's driving the (29:01)? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: That's correct. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, just on the cost to achieve on Piedmont, they seem to be kind of still running at a decent clip. Give us a sense of what's still being booked there, and when does that start to fade? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: That will continue to fade through 2017 and through 2018. We still have some software integration costs that we're looking at. That's the primary area, as you retire systems that Piedmont was on, convert data over into the Duke system, and do those types of software integration efforts. That's the main effort underway at this point. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So you think by eight \u2013 (29:49) they'll run through next year and then be small. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: That's correct. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Jon, I would add, I think the integration of Piedmont has really been a textbook integration, very smooth. The business continues to run very well. And, given our track record here of a number of mergers over time, we've developed a playbook that we've effectively executed here. So I'm really pleased with where we are in the integration. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you for that. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next one from Praful Mehta. Please go ahead. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So, quick question on the rate case, Duke Energy Progress rate case. Is the ROE something that would also be up for discussion, in terms of the 10.75%, or you think that one is more set and really not up for debate? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Praful, ROE is always up for discussion. Our allowed ROE today is 10.2%. We believe, in a rising interest rate environment, the 10.75% is a dependable ask, but ROE is always a topic of discussion, and will be in this case. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. And the rising interest rate environment is more based on projections of where you see rates going over time. Is that how they will look at it? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: That's correct. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Fair enough. Got you. And the other thing I was also looking at was the holding company debt. I think one of the slides in the back you have the issuances, and there seems to be more to be issued in this year. So it's from slide, I think, 25. Just wanted to understand, like what is the percentage target, I guess, in terms of holding company debt as a proportion to total for this year? And then, is there any concern from a notching (31:50) perspective in terms of credit ratings, where agencies are limiting or saying that, hey, above a certain level, there could be a notching (31:59) implication on the rating? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yes, Praful. As we put forth in February, we expect the holding company debt to be in the mid-30s percentage of total company debt this year. And over our five-year plan, it will crest around the mid-30s percentage and start to come down a bit in the low to mid-30s percentage by the end of the five-year plan. And we've been very transparent with the rating agencies about that. We think with our low-risk profile of our businesses that certainly is comfortable for our credit ratings, and our rating agencies have agreed with us on that. Regarding our holding company position for this year, we've issued about $1 billion, a lot of it through private placement thus far through 2017. There'll be some other issuances at the holding company level that we're planning could be fairly soon in the summer. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: And Praful, I think the important point here is, if you look at where the company is positioned, coming out of all the portfolio transition that's been underway, we operate a very strong set of regulated utilities and low-risk jurisdictions with visible capital investment that we have a demonstrated track record of completing. We've been very transparent with the agencies on our capital plans, and they're comfortable with where we are. The recent action on Moody's is an indication of that. And so there's nothing in this financing plan that's a change in the way we're managing the business. And we'll intend to execute our strategic plan in growing the company and maintaining balance sheet strength. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Understood. And just finally, I mean, you guys have a pretty good perspective across the U.S. of load growth. So wanted to understand electrification and just electric cars, there seems to be quite a trend at least expected over time to move in that direction. Do you see that as something impacting load growth over time? Do you see that as a hope for the utility sector in terms of incremental load growth? How do you view that electrification trend, I guess? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Praful, I think it is positive. And I think it will grow over time. I don't see it as a step change though in load growth because of all the other factors impacting load, including energy efficiency and other items. But it's definitely a positive trend, and we are actively in the electrification market with a team of people working in our service territories and with vendors to find ways that we can take advantage of that opportunity. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Thanks so much, guys. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Just a question, I mean... Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Mike. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Congrats on a good quarter. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I want to talk Florida for a second because you're getting in the seventh to eighth innings or so with some of the gas generation development, meaning Citrus, Hines. I'm just curious how you're looking at your Florida jurisdiction in terms of; A, the need for new conventional generation; or B, a potential utility scale solar rollout in Florida. We're seeing some of your peers in Florida, the regulated companies actually do a sizeable amount of annual investing in utility-scale solar. Just curious if your customer base and if the regulator and the intervenors who talk to you down there, kind of have an appetite for that for Duke Energy Florida? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Michael, I feel like we have a wealth of opportunities in Florida. You may remember that we're under a settlement agreement that runs through January 1, 2019. And so the team is very actively looking at the next wave of investments to deliver customer benefits. We think renewables will be a part of that. You may have noticed in our 10-year site plan, we have like 750 megawatts of solar on our agenda. But we also see additional growth investment potential in Florida. So that work is underway. And as we continue to mature those ideas and reach a timeframe where it makes sense to talk about it more specifically, we'll do that. But we see great opportunity in Florida, and really pleased with the rebound in the economy there. But the growth that Steve highlighted just underscores the strong and growing jurisdictions in which we operate. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you and much appreciated. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: I know it's early but... Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. (36:51) what you see the opportunity around Bill 589, and do you think, is that incremental capital or would that displace other capital? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Paul, one way to think about it is, there's about 3,000 megawatts or so of solar in that legislation. We have an ability to compete for 30% of that, and we have the ability to buy beyond that 30%, and flow those costs through a rider, which gives us timely investment recovery. In our five-year plan, we have something like $400 million of capital directed towards that type of investment in the Carolinas. So we do have more investment opportunities than we imagined (37:38), and our role will be to look at those investment opportunities, compare to alternatives and do as much as we can in a way that delivers great returns. So I see it as a growing list or great opportunities to deploy capital that underpins confidence and the ability to grow 4% to 6%. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And there are no more questions in queue. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Okay. Well, thank you, everyone, for participating today. We'll have a chance to see many of you over the next month or so, and look forward to a good third quarter. Of course, the IR team is available this afternoon if there are any further questions and I appreciate your interest and your investment in Duke Energy. Thanks again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call, and thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Steve will then provide an overview of our third quarter financial results and insight about economic and load growth trends. He will also share key investor considerations. Before turning the call over to Lynn, I would like to thank Chris Bauer for his contribution to our Investor Relations team over the last two and a half years. This is Chris' last earnings call as he will assume a new role in our treasury department. Many of you have worked closely with Chris and I hope you will join me in congratulating him on his new responsibilities. With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.59 for the third quarter, continuing to demonstrate growth in the fundamentals of our business. We advanced our long-term strategic investment plan while maintaining our focus on operational excellence. And our employees rose to the challenge of Hurricane Irma, one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the Atlantic. Given our results through the third quarter, we are narrowing our 2017 guidance range to $4.50 to $4.60 per share. Even with $0.15 of below-normal weather year-to-date, including the lost revenues from Hurricane Irma, we'll deliver on our earnings commitment to our shareholders. This is a testament to the dedication of our employees and our focus on flexible cost management. We are also confident in our ability to maintain our long-term growth rate of 4% to 6% off of the $4.60 midpoint of our original 2017 guidance range. We remain focused on achieving growth at the high end of our range over time as our investments build and recovery accumulates. Turning to our operational performance in the quarter, I'm proud to begin with our response to Hurricane Irma. This storm caused widespread, devastating damage across the Southeast region leaving nearly a 1.5 million of our Florida and Carolinas customers without power. And even though many of our employees' own homes and families were impacted by the storm, they put the needs of our customers first. Most of the damage was in our Florida territory with 1.3 million customers experiencing outages. More than 12,000 line and field workers rebuilt our system and restored power to over 75% of customers in just three days, and 99% within eight days. Our initial storm restoration cost estimate for our Florida service territory is almost $500 million. The majority of this will be recovered through the existing Commission storm rule or transmission tariffs. After netting our current storm reserve balance of $60 million in storm related capital replacements, we plan to defer approximately $400 million for future recovery from customers. We can also request an additional $132 million to replenish the storm reserve. Under our current rate agreement, Duke Energy Florida is authorized to begin recovering both the storm impact and reserve replenishment 60 days after filing a petition with the Commission. Based on our initial estimates, we believe the customers would see an approximate $5 increase on a typical monthly residential bill, assuming a three-year recovery period. We continue to refine our cost estimate as we prepare to file with the Commission by year-end. We also received two important recognitions in the quarter. Duke Energy was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 12th consecutive year, acknowledging our commitment to a cleaner, sustainable energy future. And Site Selection Magazine named us as one of the top utilities in economic development for the 13th consecutive year, highlighting our work to attract businesses to our service areas. We also reached an important milestone with the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of Piedmont Natural Gas. This merger has truly been a seamless, textbook integration and we're happy to have our Piedmont teammates as part of Duke Energy. We look forward to investing in this business and expanding our natural gas infrastructure for years to come. As you know, we have a busy regulatory calendar this year. Starting with Florida, we reached a constructive agreement with numerous parties in the state and the settlement was unanimously approved by the commission last week. We worked closely with stakeholders to reach an agreement that paves the way to a smarter energy future for our Florida customers. The settlement provides rate clarity through 2021 and allows us to recover up to 700 megawatts of solar energy and our grid investments, which will improve reliability and enhance customer choice. The agreement also includes recovery of investments in electric vehicle charging stations in a battery storage pilot program. As part of the settlement, we will not move forward with building the Levy nuclear plant, and customers will not pay any further costs associated with this project. Our success in reaching this settlement is another example of our ability to achieve favorable outcomes for our customers and our shareholders. We will continue to engage constructively with stakeholders as we advance our regulatory modernization agenda across all of our service areas. Slide six summarizes our pending North Carolina rate cases. Our Duke Energy Progress case is advancing and in mid-October, a number of intervenors filed written testimony advocating their positions on our request. This is a normal part of the process. As we've seen in past rate cases, the public staff and others typically recommend revenue adjustments. We remain confident in our positions and look forward to filing our rebuttal testimony this coming Monday, November 6 where we will respond to the arguments raised by intervenors. The hearings for the DEP case are scheduled to commence on November 20. At Duke Energy Carolinas, our rate case is in the early stages. We recently received a scheduling order and intervenor testimony is due January 19 and hearings are scheduled for mid-February. Slide seven outlines our strategic priorities to transform the customer experience by modernizing the energy grid, generating cleaner energy, and expanding natural gas infrastructure. Let me share a few updates on our progress starting with our grid investments. Today, we announced the expansion of our Power/Forward Carolinas initiative into South Carolina. We plan to invest $3 billion in the state, consistent with our 10-year strategy to invest $25 billion in the grid across our jurisdictions. We commissioned a University of South Carolina research economist to study the potential impacts of this initiative. According to the findings, our investments over the next 10 years will deliver significant benefits to the state, including an average of nearly 3,300 jobs supported per year, representing almost $200 million in new salaries and wages annually, more than $100 million in new tax revenue for the state, and a total economic output of more than $5 billion. We're looking forward to making these investments on behalf of our customers and to support economic development in South Carolina. In North Carolina, we announced plans for 13 megawatts of batteries spread across two sites as part of our Western Carolinas Modernization Project. And in Indiana, we'll be installing a 5-megawatt battery as part of our microgrid at Camp Atterbury. We continue to look for opportunities to deploy utility scale battery storage as costs come down and performance improves. Shifting to generation, our W.S. Lee, Citrus County and Western Carolinas combined cycle natural gas plants are progressing well, and these projects remain on time and on budget. We are also moving forward with a dual-fuel project at our Belews Creek coal-fired plant in North Carolina, representing a combined investment of over $150 million between Duke Energy Carolinas and Piedmont. This upgrade will enable 50% natural gas co-firing on two units at the site increasing fuel flexibility and lowering carbon emissions. Piedmont has filed with the NCUC for permission to build gas infrastructure to supply the plant with natural gas. The project is expected to be completed in two phases, in 2019 and 2020. During the quarter, we also saw important developments in each of our pipeline investments, Atlantic Coast Pipeline, Sabal Trail and Constitution. Atlantic Coast Pipeline reached a significant milestone on October 13 when FERC issued the final certificate. This project will stimulate significant economic development in Eastern North Carolina and support growth in the region. We are working with the relevant state agencies to secure remaining permits and expect to begin construction by the end of this year for an in-service date in late 2019. ACP also closed a revolving credit facility in October to fund approximately half of the pipeline construction costs. The project has borrowed $570 million against the facility to cover costs incurred to date with Duke's share at 47%. Regarding the Sabal Trail pipeline, FERC issued a supplemental environmental impact statement on September 27. This addressed issues noted by the D.C. Circuit Court, which vacated the project certificate. FERC and other interested parties have filed with the court for a rehearing and we expect a favorable outcome. The project remains operational as we await the court's decision. And turning to Constitution, the project filed a petition for a declaratory order in early October asking FERC to determine if New York failed to act within a reasonable time period on its water permit. We are hopeful FERC agrees with our position within the next several months, which would preserve an in-service date as early as the first half of 2019. Before I close, let me say a few words about tax reform. Duke supports comprehensive tax reform. Like everyone, we are reviewing the legislation that came out yesterday. We were encouraged to see that the bill includes provisions to retain interest deductibility in lieu of the immediate expensing of capital. We're taking a close look at these provisions and the bill as a whole, but let me say this is a positive first step, and recognizes our industry and the importance of the impact to our customers, and we will remain engaged as the process continues to unfold. As we near the close of 2017, our focus is unwavering as we execute our strategy and follow through on our commitments to customers, communities, and investors. We are on track to deliver earnings within our original guidance range for 2017, as we achieve planned growth in our regulated businesses and maintain our focus on effective cost management. Our long-term earnings growth profile of 4% to 6%, off our original midpoint of 460 is unchanged, underpinned by the strength of our regulated investments and our attractive service areas. This demonstrates the resilience of our company and the employees who deliver exceptional safety results, operational excellence, and financial performance every day. Now, let me turn it over to Steve. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thanks, Lynn. Today I will walk you through the key earnings drivers from the third quarter, discuss current retail volume trends, and update you on economic indicators. I'll close with a summary of our key investor considerations. Let's start with quarterly results. I will cover the highlights on slide eight and discuss our adjusted earnings per share variances compared to the prior-year quarter. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year, and a reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that occupy today's press release and presentation. On a reported or GAAP basis, 2017 third quarter earnings per share were $1.36, compared to $1.70 last year. The most significant drivers of the difference between the reported and adjusted earnings in the quarter were charges related to the revised Florida settlement agreement and certain commercial renewables assets. Third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.59, compared to $1.68 in the prior year. Lower results in the quarter were principally due to significantly favorable weather last year, and the absence of international energy earnings. Moving through our segments, Electric Utilities & Infrastructure results were down $0.12 compared to the prior year. Weather was the primary driver, with a $0.14 decline quarter-over-quarter. This amount includes $0.02 per share of lost revenues associated with Hurricane Irma. Depreciation and amortization was higher in the quarter due to increased investments across each of our jurisdictions. Partially offsetting these drivers were higher revenues from increases in regulatory pricing and riders. Price increases were primarily due to investment recovery through the generation base rate adjustment mechanism in Florida and new rates in Duke Energy Progress, South Carolina. With respect to riders, the strength of our energy efficiency programs continues to generate incremental earnings, helping to offset lower energy usage from our customers. Our Indiana and Ohio grid investments are also contributing to incremental rider growth. Let me also highlight that O&M was $0.01 favorable, which includes $0.03 of costs associated with Hurricane Irma. This strong result demonstrates our ongoing commitment to managing costs across our business, and we will work diligently to find additional efficiencies and demonstrate flexibility as we close out the year. In our Gas Utilities & Infrastructure segment, results were up for the quarter, primarily driven by our ongoing investment in the Atlantic Coast pipeline. As expected, the gas distribution results were flat during the warm summer months, and we anticipate these businesses will provide their remaining earnings contribution in the fourth quarter. Moving to Commercial Renewables, we were down $0.02 for the quarter. This was driven by lower solar ITCs in the current year, and higher interest expense as a result of new solar project financings this quarter. Finally, Other was up $0.14 for the quarter, based on a number of factors, including unfavorable tax adjustments in the prior year and ongoing tax planning activities. These accounted for $0.07 and $0.03, respectively. For the full year, we now expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 31% to 32%. We also had a favorable litigation settlement and lower claims at our captive insurer during the quarter. These favorable drivers were partially offset by higher interest expense at the holding company, primarily due to the Piedmont acquisition financing. As Lynn mentioned, we are narrowing our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $4.50 to $4.60 per share. This reflects our year-to-date results, including the approximate $0.15 impact of significantly unfavorable weather, and an additional $0.03 impact from Hurricane Irma, which were offset, to a large extent, by the cost management reductions we initiated earlier this year. Turning to slide 9, I'll review our retail volume trends on a rolling 12-month basis. Weather normalized retail electric load growth was 0.2%. If you remove the impact of leap day in the prior year, our rolling 12-month volume growth is in line with our long term expectation of 0.5%. The residential sector is growing 0.5% on a rolling 12-month basis, as population growth in the Southeast remains strong. This is particularly true in the Carolinas and Florida, where we are seeing residential customer additions of 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively. In Florida, every major metro area is experiencing population growth with Orlando and Tampa being two of the fastest growing metro areas in the country. Our combined gas utilities are also adding new customers at a healthy annual rate of 1.4% led by our Piedmont service territories which are growing at 1.6%. As we look ahead, positive trends in employment and wages and the continued recovery in the housing market are expected to drive ongoing residential growth. Single-family building permits remain strong and are outpacing multi-family home starts in our service areas. As of August, Florida the Carolinas, and Tennessee are in the top seven states for the number of new single-family housing permits. In our commercial customer class, sales across our jurisdictions were slightly down over the rolling 12 months. As we've experienced over the past few years, utility-sponsored energy efficiency programs partially offset growth in this customer class. We're seeing growth in hotels and restaurants; however the active hurricane season has caused some near-term interruptions for these businesses. Turning into industrials, on a rolling 12-month basis, the sector has grown 0.1%. Industries that support sales to consumers, such as construction and housing, continued to perform well. This strength is partially offset by the automotive sector and a recent slowdown in textiles. On a macro level, manufacturers have reported significant improvement over the past 12 months. According to a recent National Association of Manufacturers survey, this customer class is more positive in its outlook compared to last year signaling future strength. Overall, based on our actual results over the past few years and our expectations looking ahead, we're confident in our long-term assumption of 0.5% retail load growth and feel good about the economic health of our service areas. I'll close with our investor value proposition on slide 10. We offer an attractive 8% to 10% shareholder return that balances a strong, growing dividend and earnings growth of 4% to 6%. Our growth is driven by very low-risk, regulated investments that are supported by our strong balance sheet. In short, our attractive yield and demonstrated ability to grow our regulated businesses positions Duke Energy as the leading infrastructure investment. With that, let's open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll go first to Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning, Shar. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Morning, Shar. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : So, just touching on the grid mod, the $3 billion proposal in South Carolina. Is this kind of incremental to plan? And is there any status on the $13 billion opportunity in North Carolina, maybe just from a legislative standpoint? And when you roll in the $16 billion in potential opportunities, how does that sort of fit in with your 4% to 6%? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Yeah. You know, Shar, we have included in the plan we shared with you in February, grid investment that is generally consistent with these programs that we're talking about. We'll of course fine tune those in February when we give you an update on the five-year plan. And the approach that we've taken both in North Carolina and South Carolina is to complete economic impact studies for the benefits of these investments, also customer benefits that would be delivered directly. And we're in the process of discussions with stakeholders throughout both states, and what this investment potential could mean. We have a couple of pads on recovery which we've talked about. Of course our ultimate goal is modernization of the regulatory framework in North Carolina to allow more timely recovery of these types of investments. But in parallel, we're also pursuing recovery of grid investment in our rate case for Duke Energy Carolinas. We'll pursue a similar path in South Carolina, probably approaching first through the regulatory process and determining whether anything further is required. So, I think this represents just further underpinning of the growth that we've laid out for you and why we have confidence in our ability to deliver at 4% to 6% reaching to the higher end of the range as these investments continue to grow and accumulate. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay, higher end of the range. Okay, that's helpful. And then Lynn, think you've addressed this publicly in the past, but I'm going to put you on the spot anyway, because I know it's been on investors' minds. Is there any interest in a South Carolina nuclear plant or even expanding your footprint in the state, especially since you're already very active there from an economic development standpoint? If you could just address this dead on, it'd be good. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Sure. You know, Shar, we have no interest in the new nuclear plant in South Carolina and we've been clear about that. Given the risks and the uncertainties around completion of that plant, we don't think there's a fit either for customers or investors and we've been very candid with the state about that. As you indicate, South Carolina is incredibly important to Duke Energy. We operate important businesses and important assets in the state. We're announcing today our willingness to invest another $3 billion. So, we are continuing to operate well within the state. We're engaged and supporting our businesses in a way you would expect, but no interest in pursuing new nuclear. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks so much. I'll hop back in the queue. Operator : And we'll go next to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Morning. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Morning. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I wanted to just touch base on coal ash spend and wondered if you could remind us in terms of the precedent with Dominion in the state and just your position on the treatment just as a refresher in terms of where we stand on your point of view on recovery of coal ash spend? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Sure. Stephen, let me take the Dominion question first. There is precedent in the State of North Carolina for recovery of coal ash in the Dominion case with return oven on. And similarly in South Carolina in our own case, we received recovery of coal ash and return oven on. As you know, this is an important topic in the North Carolina cases and we are in the process of reviewing the arguments that were presented by public staff and the intervenors and we'll be responding to those very comprehensively with our rebuttal testimony on Monday. We believe that these costs are squarely within the law. They represent environmental compliance costs, and we have pursued our approach around closure of basins and around the science and engineering necessary to support compliance with the federal and state law in a very appropriate, aggressive way with science and engineering underpinning our decisions every step of the way. We believe we have a very strong case that we'll put forward on cost recovery for ash. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's helpful. And when you think about the period of time over which you do recover the costs, as you show in one of your charts, coal ash is a very significant portion of the revenue request. Is there a potential to think about a longer time period over which to have these significant costs spread, just as we're sensitive to thinking about overall customer bill impacts, or are there natural limits around thinking about duration? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Stephen, I think there's an opportunity to look at methods of recovery. If you look at our filing position, we put forward a couple of ideas for consideration by the Commission. There's a traditional deferral and amortization for costs incurred to-date and we proposed recovery of those over a five-year period. And then we also proposed a run rate, which would be to say including a certain amount in customer rates on a current basis, kind of matching the spend, which results in a lower overall cost, because it's without a return, right? It's as you spend it. We think that provides a fertile opportunity for discussion about what makes sense to customers. And that'll be a part of this case as you know. But flexibility around timing always is an opportunity. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. And then just shifting gears over to tax reform, I know we're all trying to very quickly absorb a lot of information in a short amount of time. I wondered if you might have any commentary on just the impact of holding company leverage in terms of your read of the proposal as it's laid out. I guess on my mind is just thinking about whether or not that interest is also exempted under the utility exemption that was included or if it's not exempted, if you can include the EBITDA from the utility businesses themselves, because they themselves are exempted. Just, I'm a little confused, honestly, in terms of thinking through the holdco level impact, so I'm just curious if you had any sort of preliminary thoughts on that. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Yeah, Steven, you're raising a question that we're looking very closely at. And we are evaluating and reading it closely, not only at Duke, but as an industry. I think it's important to recognize that this was a positive step and I think there's clear recognition in the language of the capital we spend, the impact to customers, the importance of interest, forgoing capital expensing normalization, excess deferred taxes are transitioned in an appropriate way. And so, when we look at the holding company, the area that we're focused on is this allocation to a trader business in a regulated utility and we'll be looking very closely at that, we believe, and we will also be engaged in discussions around intent and clarification and will be closely pursuing that over the next several days and coming weeks. But I think the important thing is, there's clear recognition of our industry in this framework, the importance to infrastructure economic development and we believe there could be a path forward on this. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's helpful. Agreed, it was a helpful overall result for the industry. So thank you very much. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, guys. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Morning. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Hello. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Morning. Just to be clear, the $3 billion grid modernization plan for South Carolina, that's incremental to the previously disclosed $13 billion Power/Forward plan or is that part of it? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: That's really part of the overall grid plan that we've got in our five-year planning, Michael. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: But, it's incremental to the $13 million, Michael, because $13 million was North Carolina... Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Just North Carolina. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: That's just North Carolina. Okay. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: ...remaining in South Carolina. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got you. So, but it's not additive to the $37 billion CapEx plan. That's what you're saying, right? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: That's correct. That's part of all of our total growth capital in our five-year plan. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got you. And given that there's been no settlement in the DEP case at this point in the process, do you think it's more likely than not that the North Carolina cases are fully litigated rather than settled? And how would you characterize that? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: You know, Michael, we can't comment at this point on whether we're engaged in settlement discussions or whether we will be engaged in settlement discussions. We're in a tight and important time period over the next couple of weeks. What we can talk about is rebuttal testimony on Monday, on November 6. I think that'll give you a very clear view of our response to the arguments that have been put forward. And then the hearing is scheduled for November 20. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, Lynn. Thank you. Just to clarify, so I think you just answered. The $3 billion South Carolina plan is in your capital plan and 4% to 6% growth rate. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: That's correct. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yes, that's correct. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. And then, how ... Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: The only modification that I would make to that, Steve, is to say, we always fine tune these capital estimates as to timing, near-term, longer term. But you'll recall back in February, we laid out grid investment as a key priority of ours and what we've done is continue to put flesh on the bones and brand them and do the important work with stakeholders. So, it is part of that strategy we laid out. We'll be fine tuning where and how much as we go forward, but you should think about it as part of our strategic plan. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, great. And then, I think you also had a plan that you've at least talked about for North Carolina, in terms of grid modernization. Where does that stand, and is that in your capital plan too, or is it kind of same thing, it's part of the mix of different options? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: You know, it's in the plan, Steve, in the same way I just described for South Carolina. And we are pursuing it on a couple of courses, right, the legislative initiatives that we've talked about. It's also \u2013 the DEC piece is also in our Duke Energy Carolinas case, which will proceed in early 2018. So we'll continue to update as we go. We're obviously looking for ways that we can continue to accelerate that investment for the benefit of our customers and achieve the appropriate regulatory outcome. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. One clarification also, what is the renewables impairments, the adjustment that you made? What assets did you impair there? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yes. The impairment was of some wind farms in West Texas, the Ocotillo wind farm. That had been acquired quite a while ago, roughly 10 years ago. And as we look forward, we see a lot of exploration of the PTCs because these are older facilities, and those are uncontracted assets selling into the merchant market, and some of those prices are projected to be pretty low. So those factors led to the impairment of those assets. Most of our facilities, our renewable facilities, are contracted with third party off-takers. This is one of our earlier ones that was not. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you, Steve. Operator : And we'll go next to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Just curious... Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, Lynn. Just curious how you're thinking about, once ACP comes online, so I'm thinking two years from now, in South Carolina, whether there is a need to have new gas midstream infrastructure in the state, especially since it seems that, with new nuclear plants now not moving forward in that state, you're likely to see an uptick in gas-fired generation burn. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: You know, Michael, I believe there's a keen interest on the part of South Carolina for expanded and continued investment in gas infrastructure, for the reasons that you talked about. Our focus obviously is on the project as it's defined and constituted today, so it's been on \u2013 we're pleased with the FERC approval, we're moving forward with state approvals. But as the construction progresses, we'll of course be looking for ways that we can continue deliver value to customers in the states in which we operate. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. So you're not seeing \u2013 I want to make sure I kind of understand what you're kind of saying there. You're not necessarily seeing an immediate need, meaning 2020 to 2025 timeframe, to have sizable new midstream into South Carolina yet? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: I'm just not prepared to give you specific timing, Michael. So the timing that you talk about is certainly within our planning horizon. We want to get ACP in first, which is late 2019, so we'll talk more specifically about expansion opportunities as time progresses here. So I wouldn't read anything into when or where it falls in that timeframe, but we do believe that additional infrastructure could be important to our customers and to the states in which we operate. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And coming to the Carolinas on the electric grid modernization program, both in North Carolina and South Carolina, do you need legislation to get trackers or kind of more real-time recovery, or is that, in your view, something that each of the two Commissions could do without actually having to get a new legislation? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Michael, I believe the Commissions could provide tracking recovery in both states for this type of investment. And you see us making a request for that in the Duke Energy Carolinas case. I would also say that the Commission will give us feedback on that and if they believe additional clarification is required to the legislature, we could certainly pursue it there as well. So, I think this is something that remains an ongoing topic of discussion for Duke as we think about modernizing our system and delivering value to customers. We're engaged with stakeholders, we're talking about the benefits that this brings. And we'll just continue to progress it. We see it as a terrific not only opportunity for customers, but obviously investors as well. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Last item, O&M management, in terms of thinking about any synergies that might have existed as part of the Piedmont acquisition or just in general about being able to manage, to keep O&M either flat or even make it decline, where do you see the greatest opportunities within the organization over the next two to three years to manage O&M? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: You know, Michael, we certainly have recognized some synergies with the Piedmont merger, in fact, in excess of what we'd originally projected. Most of those are in corporate type functions. I think as we look forward over the next few years, there's a lot of opportunities for synergies, particularly in the distribution area, as we roll out some of these grid investments that we've been talking about. Smart meters will displace the need for meter readers. Technology along the grid will allow us to know how equipment is performing and help us optimize around maintenance activities. Those are examples of things to come. We've already seen great success in the generation areas around fossil and nuclear efficiencies, but we've got a lot of good functions that will continue to drive efforts in the efficiency areas. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Lynn. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thanks. Operator : And we'll go next to Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Greg. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Hey. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Every single one of my questions was asked, but I just wanted to ask a clarifying question on the tax issue. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Sure. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Clearly, I'm not a congressman, nor am I a legal expert on these issues, but in reading the House Ways and Means Committee summary of the initial plan, it indicated that the interest deduction would be limited to the equivalent of 30% of any company's pre-tax income at the filer level. And so from my perspective, it would seem that \u2013 I mean there aren't any utilities that I do research on that even come close to that hurdle, including you. So it would seem to me that just based on that interpretation, you would, in fact, have interest deductibility on your parent debt. Are you just loathed to make an opinion on that, or you don't think that I'm reading it clearly? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: You know Greg, I think the clarifying question there or clarifying point there is, who is a filer? Is it the individual tax payers or is it an affiliated group and consolidated group? And I think, depending on that interpretation and the corporate structure of any utility, that will have a bearing. What we believe is that the combination of the allocation of interest to trades or businesses that are regulated coupled with the 30% and the structure that we have in front of us, we believe we've got a framework here that we can work with. But as you know, it's 24 hours. Everyone's reading every word. Everyone's looking at all the interpretations. We're meeting with the industry. And I think the early read is, we see a lot of positive recognition of our industry. But we want to continue to make sure that we've got the appropriate interpretation and see if any clarification is necessary as this bill progresses. Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI : Okay. That's fair. Thank you. Have a great day. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thanks. Operator : And we'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Julien. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Morning. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So perhaps just to follow a little bit up on the South Carolina program. Can you elaborate a little bit on the regulatory recovery thought process here, just in terms of the cadence perhaps of future rate cases, should you peruse the full $3 billion? Just how does that change versus what you'd previously articulated, if at all just be very clear about this? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Yeah. So, Julien you may recall, we filed a South Carolina Duke Energy Progress case recently. So, we'll be evaluating capital investment to prepare that utility to go back in. And then, we're evaluating timing on Duke Energy Carolina, South Carolina and also looking at our investment plan to catch that case at the right time. So we always are fine tuning the regulatory calendar. It may move up, it may move back, but what we're trying to communicate today is we see grid investment as an important part of growth in those utilities and we'll be pursuing timely recovery. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. So would you say that barring at any novel trackers, whether approved by the Commission, or likely approved by the Commission or legislative, would you expect to be filing cases on a semi-regular basis in order to ensure kind of earned or near earned ROEs? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: I think that's fair. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Yes. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. And then maybe just following a little bit up on the gas side, obviously, I think at times you've kind of characterized the company as keen, or more keen to look towards gas into the future than perhaps electric. I don't want to put words in your mouth. How are you thinking about that today in terms of your future? And gas including midstream, utility, et cetera. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: You know, Julien, we couldn't be more pleased with the integration of the Piedmont system, not only in terms of the business that they bring, but the expertise and the focus on natural gas. And with the position that Duke holds as a company, second largest consumer of natural gas, we see that as a growing opportunity for us. We're also pleased with progress on Atlantic Coast pipeline. I mean that's a $2 billion investment for us and we're anxious to get construction underway later this year. But we will continue to look for ways we can leverage our market position and expertise to bring investment into the gas business. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. All right. Excellent. I'll leave it there. Thank you all very much. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : See you soon. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Okay. Operator : And we'll go next to Ali Agha with SunTrust. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Morning. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Morning. Lynn or Steve, when you look at your full plan, the $37 billion plan for CapEx, and as you mentioned, you've laid out the South Carolina proposal as part of that. As we sit here today, how much of that plan is now visible out there versus stuff that will eventually come, but hasn't yet been put out there, just to get some rough idea of that? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Well, I think the $37 billion has been well vetted here. We have very good ideas on the grid spend in terms of targeted undergrounding, smart meters, storm hardened equipment. When you look at the piece of the $37 billion, that's related to generating cleaner energy, we have generation facilities such as Citrus or Lee CCs. We've got \u2013 our gas growth portion of the plan, $6 billion is very well defined between ACP and the Piedmont distribution investment. So I think we have a very high percentage of plans that we can lay our hands on. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: The Florida settlement also Ali, lays the path in Florida for both grid and renewables. And House Bill 589 in the Carolinas also provides a pathway on additional investment around renewables in North Carolina. So all of the steps you see us taking in 2017 are underpinning confidence in those capital investment plans. They're transparent, they're clear and understandable, and they're projects that we have expertise to deliver. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And then, thinking about the 4% to 6% growth rate, you obviously have two big rate cases right now and we should get clarity on that fairly soon. So, just given the timing of the rate cases, does that cause the earnings growth to be lumpy, perhaps more front-end loaded or are you thinking of it more straight line? How are you thinking about this 2017 through 2021 period? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: You know, Ali, when we talked about guidance this year, we were clear that the plan we've put in front of you gives us the ability to be within the range every year and that is really in response to that question about, will you fall outside of the range because of general rate cases et cetera. The plan we've put in front of you puts us squarely within the range every year. And so that's what we're executing to. And as you know, we'll give you a fuller update on the specifics around 2018 and refinement of the capital in February. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Right. And last question, Steve you mentioned the effective tax rate to think about is 31% to 32% for the year. Is that a good number to think about as we model future years or what should we think about future tax rate? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Well that, again we will be rolling out our tax assumptions in February for upcoming five-year plan. But we've got to think about tax reform that's going on right now and assimilate where that's at. Certainly this year we've done some good work around tax optimization to bring in some tax savings that have lowered the effective tax rate a bit for us. But too hard to predict in the future given what's going on right now. We'll be working on that and rolling that out in February. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Understood. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Hello. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I just wanted to ask two quick questions, the first on coal ash. Hypothetically speaking, let's say that you are unable to get the recovery that you guys feel you deserve, there, ultimately. What kind of leeway on spending do you have going forward, given the fact that you have kind of the lion's share to go, and you have the law that you have to comply with? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Well Chris, we'll comply with the law. We have state and federal requirements; CAMA in North Carolina, CCR in the Carolinas, and then throughout our service territory. So that's what we are \u2013 we'll comply with all of those requirements. And we will aggressively pursue recovery, and we'll have more to say about that, of course, as we work through these rate cases. There are court appeals and other avenues we could pursue if we think that's appropriate. We believe we have a very strong case. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I know there's multiple categorizations of the ash ponds and timing associated with each one of those. But is there leeway on timing, in addition to what you just described? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: You're probably thinking about the risk rating in North Carolina, Chris. So we have certain sites that are due by the 2019, 2024, 2029. There are also timeframes within CCR. So you may have flexibility within a year or so, depending on how you ramp up the activity. But when you look at the project overall, the team is doing an outstanding job of balancing the compliance requirements with the spending in a way that minimizes cost to the extent we can, but of course complying with the law, as we always will. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then my second question is on the renewables segment. I think the impairment this quarter was excluded from your adjusted EPS. So if we just look at the adjusted number year-to-date, looks like maybe you're falling a little bit short of plan. I think that segment last year also was not quite where you had originally wanted it to be. Anything we should be aware of there, versus your expectations? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: No. You know, Chris, the other thing I'd point to is, we've had weak wind resources in 2017, which has had an impact on results year-to-date. So we're continuing to operate the assets well. There will be weather variability, and there will be some variability around timing of projects, particularly those that are impacted by ITC, but nothing additional that I'd share with you from a strategic point of view on that segment. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, Lynn. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our last question today from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks so much. So, if possible, can we go back to tax reform for one minute? Just wanted to understand, on this holding company debt and the interest deductibility on that debt. Is it possible, from the read, that holding company would be treated as a separate tax filer relative to the utilities, in which case obviously the utility, holding company, has no income and purely just an interest expense, if that were the scenario. Can that scenario play out, or do you think that's not realistic? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: No, you know Praful, we do have certain of our utilities flowing up into the tax payer called Duke Energy Corporation, just the way we are structured. And so, I think there are a couple of avenues we're looking at; this allocation to trader business, a regulated utility, and then of course the 30% test. So, we believe we see a path here, but it's 24 hours. We want to take the time to understand, get the clarification. But I think the progress that we've made in this, and the recognition of our industry, is something that should not be overlooked. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Fair enough. And then secondly, on this Duke Energy Progress, the response from the staff obviously was quite conservative, in terms of the rate increase versus what you've asked. You seem pretty confident that you should be able to get to a good position there. Just any more color on that would be helpful. And what if you don't hit \u2013 like, let's say you get 50% of the ask. Just what does that mean for growth and 4% to 6% growth as well? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Yeah, so Praful, I would point again to this rebuttal testimony that we're filing on November 6. We disagree with the positions that were put forward on ash in particular, as well as a number of other items that were highlighted in the testimony. We believe they're not supported by precedent or the law, and we'll make those positions very clear. We are open to settlement discussions. Cannot comment on whether we are engaged or will be engaged in those discussions. But the process needs to play out over the next couple of weeks; hearing's of course on the [November] 20. And I think the potential implication to the financial results, we'll share with you when we have more information to share, and I think this is just a process that's going to need to unfold, not only over the next couple of weeks, but of course the Commission order is not expected until early 2018. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. Well, thanks so much guys, and look forward to catching up with you yet. (52:55) Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Okay. Operator : And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Great. Thank you. And thank you for your interest and investment in Duke Energy. We look forward to seeing many of you next week at EEI and continuing discussion. So thanks again for your time this morning. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

Please note the appendix for today\u2019s presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $4.57, closing on a very successful year for our company. We made progress on our strategic investments and delivered earnings at the high-end of our narrowed guidance range, demonstrating flexibility and cost management and largely offsetting the impacts of mild weather. Our workforce pushed forward on our long-term transformation and never lost side of our responsibility to meet the everyday needs of our customers. We also announced our 2018 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.55 to $4.85, which includes the impacts of tax reform and planned equity issuances to maintain the strength of our balance sheet. We are reaffirming our 4% to 6% growth rate through 2021 up at the midpoint of our original guidance range in 2017 and extending the growth rate through 2022. Rate base growth from our investments plan coupled with additional rate base from the impact of tax reform will place us within the guidance range by 2019 and at the high, mid to high-end of the range in 2020 and beyond. Steve will provide more context about our financial results, discuss our capital growth plan and share how we are incorporating the impact of tax reform into our planning assumption. But first, let me spend a moment on Slide 4. The industrial proposition we introduced last year remained adjusted true today. The fundamentals of our business are strong and allow us to deliver growth in earnings and dividends in a low risk, predictable and transparent way. And given the capital intensive nature of our business, the importance of balance sheet strength remains a continued focus for the company. Our attractive dividend yield and demonstrated ability to grow our regulated businesses providing attractive shareholder return for our investors. This positions Duke as a strong long-term infrastructure investment. Slide 5 underscores our established track record of delivery and our commitment. Overall, 2017 was an exceptional year for Duke Energy. We delivered results, advanced our long-term strategy and excelled in operation. We had solid growth in our Electric and Gas Utilities including the addition of Piedmont Natural Gas. We also refine of the great flexibility offsetting weak weather with cost management. And these results enabled us to deliver strong earnings and increased the dividend by 4%. Our commitment of safety and outstanding operational performance continued in 2017. Our employees delivered outstanding safety metrics with a total incident case rate of 0.36, a 10% improvement on our industry leading performance in 2016. For the second consecutive year, the combined capacity factor of our nuclear fleet reached record setting levels above 95%. And in the ways of Hurricane Irma our employees return power to more than 1.5 million customers in just over a week. Last month Fortune magazine named Duke Energy to its 2018 list of the World's Most Admired Companies, a true indication that our stakeholders understand the journey we're onto Duke and the progress we're making. Finally, we demonstrated progress across our strategic investments program and we worked collaboratively with stakeholders to advance our regulatory modernization initiatives better aligning recovery with our investments. We've seen the benefits of this approach this past year in Florida with the approval of our multiyear rate settlements, including recovery in grid and solar investments in North Carolina with the passage of HB 589 in the addition of rider recovery mechanisms for re-levels. Turning to Slide 6, we've outlined our 10 year investment priorities consistent with the plan we shared with you in early '17. Our investments were focused on strengthening our energy delivery system by investing $25 billion to create a smarter energy grid, generating cleaner energy by investing $11 billion in natural gas and renewable energy and expanding our natural gas infrastructure doubling the contribution of this segment. We will also continue to engage stakeholders on regulatory modernization and fundamentally change the way we operate to transform the customer experience and achieve top cortile customer satisfaction. As [Indiscernible] told that everything we do are our employees and their dedications operational excellence. We will invest in infrastructure our customers' value and deliver sustainable growth for our investors. Let me walk you through how we plan to maintain our momentum and execute on our strategy in 2018. Slide 7 provides an update on our efforts to modernize the energy grid. Our objective is to improve system performance in all aspects, customers in trolling convenience, security and service reliability. In 2017, we announced the power forward Carolina's initiative, our 10-year $16 billion plan to modernize our grid in both North and South Carolina. This investment will provide a strong economic stimulus to the Carolinas, creating more than 17,000 jobs and more than $26 billion in economic output over the next decade. To recover this investment, we've proposed a grid rider mechanism in our pending Duke Energy Carolina's North Carolina rate case. We look forward to continuing this conversation at the evidentiary hearing scheduled to begin next week. In Florida, our multiyear rate plan includes the rate increases to recover our grid modernization investments in the state. Work is already underway. And in October we completed work on our first self-optimizing grid network. This automation enables to grow the software identify problems and reroute power to shorten or even eliminate outages for customers. As we expand this program in 2018, we plan to deploy 100 self-optimizing networks in our service areas. In Indiana and Ohio, we've been recovering $600 million annually through our paying commission and distribution riders, investing in Hardening and Resiliency and other grid improvements. The progress service territories we are also deploying smart meters providing increased convenience choices installed for our customers. With installations with 1.2 meters in 2017, 40% of our customer base now benefits from this technology. We planned to install an additional 1.4 million meters in 2018 and remain on track to fully deploy the program by 2021. And we are leveraging emerging technologies to benefit our customers. We're deploying over 500 electric vehicles charging stations across our Florida footprint, supporting increased demand for the service and a potential source of new load. We're also installing battery storage across many of our jurisdictions with 185 megawatts of projects installed or not. Our greatest footprint projects are essential to create the foundation for a smarter energy future. We will continue to engage with stakeholders to ensure the pace and scale of our investments align with customer needs in each of our jurisdiction and optimize value for our shareholders. Slide 8 provides an update on the ongoing transformation of our generation fleet. We\u2019ve made significant tries to reduce our environmental footprint and have already lowered our carbon emissions by 31% from 2005. In 2017, we extended our commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. With more than 11 really dedicated to building more efficient natural gas fired plants and renewable generation, we will continue to diversify our generation portfolio while maintaining competitive rates for our customers. Its part of our assessment of the long-term impact of our changing portfolio, we also announced that we will issue a new climate report in the first quarter of 2018. This report will outline our ongoing commitment to environmental stewardship and sustainable energy production. Advancing our generation strategy the W.S. Lee plant located in South Carolina this year final commissioning and we'll start serving our Carolina's customers soon. Construction progresses on our Citrus County Combined Cycle project in Florida and the Western Carolina's Modernization Project in North Carolina, which are expected to be in service in 2018 and 2019 respectively. And we are expanding our investment in renewable energy. Our Florida multiyear rate plan allows us to build up to 700 megawatts of new solar generation in the state. Combined with the procurement of almost 2,700 megawatts solar in North Carolina under HB 589, we are clearly making progress on our carbon reduction goal. Furthermore, these regulatory and legislative achievements in Florida and North Carolina reflect modern mechanism to recover these investments, demonstrating the success of our stakeholder engagement efforts. Finally our nuclear dealers are fundamental to provide a carbon-free generation to our more than 4 million Carolinas customers. These units represent the largest regulated nuclear fleet in the country and are essential to our long term carbon reduction goal. As we look ahead, we are evaluating license extension for these facilities for an additional 20 years to continue serving customers with the reliable service they expect. Moving to Slide 9, let me update you on our national gas business. October marks the one year anniversary of the Piedmont Natural Gas acquisition and we're seeing the positive results of this transaction. Natural gas will play a major role in the cleaner energy future and we are leveraging the overlap between our electric and gas businesses to better serve our customers. We have added Marshall Steam Station to our list of dual-fuel projects in North Carolina. Our three dual-fuel projects announced in the last year represent a $500 million investment for both Duke Energy Carolinas and Piedmont and demonstrate the complementary nature of our franchises and advantages of joint planet. We will use coal-firing of coal and natural gas at Rogers, Belews Creek and Marshall to reduce our carbon emissions and increase our flexibility to manage costs providing savings to customers. We've reached important milestones for our midstream gas business. We recently completed Sabal Trail pipeline and the Atlantic Coast pipeline are critical infrastructure investments that will bring much needed gas supplies to the Southeast as well as economic growth in rural areas of the region. During a record cold weather in early January or heavy demand hit homes, hospitals and industrial buildings caused natural gas prices to soar due to gas transportation constraints in North Carolina. This provides a clear reminder of an ACP work is an important source of natural gas for our region and will help provide significant savings for customers. We\u2019re pleased to see work has started on ACP under limited notices to proceed from FERC beginning construction activates in permitted areas. After more than three years of comprehensive studies, North Carolina's Department of Environmental Quality issued key permits for the pipeline in late-January. These approvals along with permits receive from the Army Corps of Engineers brings us several steps closer to beginning full construction of this pipeline and we are way to receive of the final permits from Virginia. It has been a river of constraints in transparent permitting process for this 600 mile pipeline. And we continue to target an end service state of late 2019. Future delays and more stringent conditions of the permitting process, ACP now estimate total project costs between $6 billion and $6.5 billion. As a reminder, Duke's share in these costs is 47%. I\u2019m going to close by saying that we have a clear view of the passage at Duke Energy. With our customers at the center of everything we do, we\u2019re transforming our company, while providing reliable safe and affordable energy. Stakeholders depend on us to deliver on our commitment and we did adjust that for 2017. From financial results to operational excellence, we created value for our customers to shareholders and this focus will continue into 2018 and beyond. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve. Steven Young : Thanks, Lynn. As mentioned, we had a solid year delivered on our financial conditions. As you can see on Slide 10, we achieved adjusted earnings per share of $4.57, which was near the high-end of our narrowed guidance range. We are already seeing the benefits of our portfolio of transition with the focus on stable, predicable and regulated businesses. We grew our electric utilities through higher pricing in riders, organic loan growth and ongoing investments across our jurisdictions. Our gas segment also demonstrated growth, driven by Piedmont's contribution and additional earnings from our midstream pipelines. Additionally we achieve our cost management targets, which offset the majority of the below-normal weather we experienced during the year. Overall, we are pleased with the growth across our businesses. Turning to Slide 11, let me walk you through key implications of the new federal tax law. As you know, the tax reform has been a key focus for the utility industry. We were successful in advocating for industry's specific provisions that will benefit both customers and shareholders. As the holding company, the lower income tax rate will reduce the tax yield on interest expense resulting in lower earnings beginning in 2018. At the utilities, tax reform results in lower accrued tax expense, which provides opportunities for lowering rates to customers. However, because Duke Energy is not a significant cash tax payer, any reduction to customer rates will place downward pressure on our consolidated cash flows. Recall, we\u2019ve been in the net operating loss position for tax purposes for the last few years due to bonus depreciation. We currently estimate we will be out of the NOL in 2019 and begin using our accumulated tax credits through the balance of the five year plan. In response to these issues state regulators have initiated dockets in our jurisdictions. In general, we are recommending to use the lower tax rates to reduce customer rates in the near-term as well as help offset future rate increases. We have made several proposals including accelerated depreciation, recovering investments more quickly or amortizing regulatory assets. This would allow us to recover certain costs and maintain utility credit quality while avoiding volatility in customer rates. In Florida, the commission has already approved using the benefits from tax reforms to offset the increase in customer rates with Hurricane Irma restoration and to accelerate depreciation of certain closings. Overall, we expect customers to see savings overtime, which will vary based on the regulatory outcomes in each state. Tax reform also provides some benefits to cash flow. Due to the treatment of our alternative minimum tax spreads, the new law provides for a full refund with AMC credits over the 2018 to 2021 tax use. As of December 31, we had approximately 1.2 billion of credits subject to this refund. Another major impact of tax reform is to increase the utility rate base. This occurs as the lower tax rate and elimination of bonus depreciation resulting lower deferred taxes, which, in turn, increases rate base. As a result, we will see higher rate base growth for the same level of capital spend resulting in an increase in the company's earnings power. Given that the positive drivers will take some time to manifest, we are taking steps to further strengthen our balance sheet and fund our capital program. In 2018, we intend to issue $2 billion of equity including our original expectation for $350 million of equity via the drill. We also have reduced our five year capital plan by approximately $1 billion. I'll share more details about the capital and financing plans in a moment. On Slide 12, we have outlined more detail about the earnings impacts of tax reform. This morning, we announced our 2018 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.55 to $4.85 per share. Earnings for 2018 will be driven by ongoing investment programs across our jurisdictions, low growth expectations and the continuation of our regulatory recovery activities. We have best of the lower corporate tax rate being resolution from plant equity issuances we'll partially offset this organic growth. With this in mind the midpoint of our 2018 guidance range is slightly below the 4% to 6% earnings per share growth rate, we introduced last year. However, we expect to be within the range by 2019 and at the mid-to-high end of the range in 2020 and beyond given that the rate base will now grow at a faster pace. Turning to Slide 13, our growth will be supported by our five-year $37 billion growth capital plan. Our investments aligned with our strategies to modernize the energy grid, generate cleaner energy and expand natural gas infrastructure. In light of cash reform, we have lowered our total capital over the five year plan by about $1 billion. We have expanded our cost management capability and applied this to capital. Furthermore, we are optimizing our operational capital around regulatory activities in the land. We have modestly increased our level of investment in commercial intervals. And we look to utilize tax equity partners to continue invest in solar and wind projects. The total capital plan is lower than originally outlined in 2017. Tax reform has approximately $3.5 billion to rate base by 2021. Earnings base now grows to the 7% CAGR through this timeframe, representing a 1% increase compared to what we presented last year. The new tax law will also provide additional headroom in customer bills allowing us to continue making smart investments, while also keeping rates as low as possible. Overall, we are taking a balanced approach and we are confident we will continue to meet the needs of customers and investors. Moving to Slide 14, let me walk you through our 2018 financing plan. We are committed to maintain the strength of the balance sheet as we look to finance our expensive capital plan over the forecasted year. As I mentioned earlier, in 2018, we plan to issue $2 billion in equity including the $350 million we already expected to issue to the DRIP. We plan to raise this equity to a discrete transaction within the next few months and by selling shares under our recently filed ATM broker. We may utilize the forward structure to better align proceeds from the equity offerings with the timing of our actual cash needs. This will help to avoid unnecessary share dilution in 2018. We will be opportunistic in completing our incremental equity needs with the goal of completing it by the end of the year. Going forward, we still expect to issue $350 million of equity per year to a combination of our DRIP/ATM programs. We continue to be discipline with our approach to capital reducing the level of investment versus a year ago. Additionally, we will maintain our focus on cost control, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. All of these actions will improve our credit metrics over the five-year plan. Our balance sheet will be supported by the equity issuances and planned regulatory activity, which in turn -- which will turn our investments into cash returns more equity. By 2020, we expect our FFO to debt ratio to be in the range of 15% to 16% and our Holdco to debt percentage to be in the low-30s both aligning with our targets. We believe the combination of the 2018 and the ongoing annual equity issuances, satisfies all of our equity needs and provides the balance sheet strength to execute on our business plan. Turning to Slide 15, our attractive service territories for constructive regulatory frameworks and our cost management efforts have allowed us to earn at or near or allowed ROEs. We\u2019re seeing strengthened customer growth across our jurisdictions, particularly in the Southeast, and expect this to continue. This trend supports growth in our electric and gas utilities. We continue to plan the 0.5% annual retail loan growth in our electric utilities in 2017, weather normalized retail loan growth is 0.4% equivalent to 0.7% when excluding the impacts of the lead day in the prior year. This tracks with our planning assumptions. Several macroeconomic indicators support our loan growth projections. Overall, the U.S. economy is strengthened and leading indicators point to continued expansion for the commercial and industrial segments. In addition, the U.S. dollar continues to support domestic manufacturing. And optimism for retail and small businesses is near all-time high. Furthermore, key objective of the new tax laws to stimulate business investments, create jobs and grow the economy. At this time, we\u2019re not incorporated effects from tax reform in our volume growth planning assumption, but expect it could be an upside to our forecast. We are also managing our cost structure using new technology and rolling out data analytics to extend our commitment to keep non recoverable O&M flat through 2022. The use of mobile applications is bolstering productivity and we are keenly focused on identifying efficiencies throughout operational and corporate structures. As we look to the future, we are developing our digital capabilities to faster and connected culture. Due to modernization, of course, customer systems and grid infrastructure, we will see tangible benefits in savings. 2017 was a busy regulatory year for us. Slide 16 outlines our projected activity over the planning horizon to achieve timely recovery of our investments. We have a robust capital plan that involves substantial investment in electric and gas infrastructure over the next five years, and we have modern regulatory recovery mechanisms in place for many of these investments. In Florida, we have the multiyear rate agreement through 2021. In Ohio and Indiana, we have riders to recover transmission and distribution investments and are requesting extension of the distribution rider in Ohio. In North Carolina, we now have renewable riders established to HB 589. And at Piedmont, we have distribution infrastructure riders. We will continue to pursue these types of recovery mechanisms to enhance our investment returns. Let me take a moment to discuss our pending base rate cases in North Carolina. We expect an order in the Duke Energy progress takes any day and no later than March 1. New rates will be effective soon after the orders issued. Our Duke Energy Carolinas rates cases progress with the evidentiary hearing schedule to begin on February 27 with requested rates to be effective May 1 in that case, if approved by the commission. Shifting to Slide 17, we understand the value of the dividend to our shareholders and are dedicated to growing it responsibly. 2018 marks the 92nd consecutive year paying the quarterly cash dividend, demonstrating the stead fast commitment to our investments. We expect to maintain our annual dividend growth rate of approximately 4% to 6% though 2022, consistent with our long-term earnings growth as we target our payout ratio in the 70% to 75% range. Given the near term impacts of tax reform, we expect the payout ratio will be higher than the targeted range initially. Therefore dividend growth will be closer to the low end of the guidance range for next couple of years as we work the payout ratio backed in. The growth rate will increase as we are more solidly positioned in the payout ratio range. Before we open it up to questions, let me turn to Slide 18. Our history of operational excellence coupled with the strategic plan that is already producing compelling results, gives us confidence as we continue to offer a solid long-term investment opportunity. Our track of dividend yield combined with earnings growth from investments in our regulatory utilities provides a strong risk adjusted return for our shareholders. We are positioned to deliver results for both customers and shareholders and are confident in the plan we have for 2018 and beyond. With that, we'll open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] And we will take our first question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shar Pourreza : Good morning, guys. Lynn Good : Good morning, Pourreza. Shar Pourreza : Just a quick modeling question. Can you elaborate a little bit on the drivers of growth from '18 to '19, Steve. I mean, to take you back within that previous 4% to 6% range by '19. You sort of would need a lot of growth year-over-year almost 8% just using the midpoint of the 2018 guide. I know it's not linear, but are we thinking about this step-up in earnings correctly? Should we think more bottom end in '19? Just remind us how you are closing that gap? Steven Young : Well, let me discuss some of the drivers here for 2019, and that really pretty similar to the drivers that we have in our businesses each year. We've got rate riders and rate cases that take into play. We've got our normal volumes growth, which has been pretty strong as well. And then there is AFUDC on various investments. When you look at 2019, it will have the full-year impact of the Carolinas rate cases, and then in 2019, we expect to see accelerated spending in Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Of those will be a couple of big drivers towards the earnings that you might see in that particular year, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Okay, that's helpful. And then just we'll take on ACP, it's good that it's moving sort of the head here. But at what point sort of in the construction cycle should we think about incremental growth opportunities? Is it sort of post to state approvals or where the later part of the construction phase? Like how are you thinking about the next leg of growth with ACP 2 and 3? Lynn Good : Shar, thanks for that question. We are proud of the progress that we've made over the last couple of months with state and federal permits. And our focus is ramping up construction to hit a late 2019 in service aid. I think about additional investment opportunities in Chile, there is expansion of ACP, which would occur in the form of compression, a very cost effective way to add capacity, and then extension would be another opportunity. I think, at this point, our focus is on building the initial project as it's establish, we'll then our attention to expansion -- compression expansion, really driven by needs of our customers and then following that, we'll look at opportunities to expand. Shar Pourreza : Got it. That's helpful. And then just, Lynn, one strategic question, Duke falls in and at of M&A charter, especially, recently with some of the jurisdictions that you've been active in, which is Indiana and the Carolinas, can you just sort of refresh your thoughts on how you are thinking about additional growth through inorganic opportunities in light of kind of what you are seeing as far as tax reform, and sort of maybe even the stress on sort of the balance sheet? A - Lynn Good Our focus, Shar, is on organic growth at this point. We feel like we've got a very robust set of investments within our jurisdictions and very attractive jurisdictions that give us an opportunity to deliver benefits to customers and investors. With the steps we've taken around the balance sheet, the equity issuance that also positions us to support that organic growth. And so M&A is not a part of our strategic plan to achieve what we've laid out before you. We look at that as opportunistic, but we're really comfortable with the organic plan we have set forth. Shar Pourreza : Excellent. Thanks so much. I'll jump back in the queue. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd : Hi, good morning. Lynn Good : Good morning, Steve. Steven Young : Good morning. Stephen Byrd : I just want to touch on what you've mentioned in terms of further growth in Renewables and the Commercial segment. Just at a high level, I'm curious your thoughts on the competitive environments for Renewables, the degree of growth potential there. What are you seeing out there on the competitive playing field for that business? Lynn Good : Steven, I think, the business is a competitive business. I think there is some adjusting as a result of the tariffs that have recently been imposed. We'd like to see how that landscape plays out. We also are pacing the lower tax rate. We have to determine how capped equity markets perform, although we still expect them to be there. So we believe, we have a very solid business, a business of scale, we believe we're capable of competing. So we have also been appropriately conservative with our assumptions around returns and are not going to chase it unless it\u2019s delivering a return above our cost of capital. And that will be our approach as we go forward. I would point to regulate renewables as well, so we\u2019ve got 700 megawatts from building within Florida. HB 589 in North Carolina represents an opportunity for either our commercial regulated business among we working closely those opportunities as well. Stephen Byrd : That's helpful. And thank you. And then just thinking high level around Amazon and the potential for them to put HQ number two in your service territory, without any too specific, I\u2019m just curious, you\u2019re thinking at a high level as to what will be required to accommodate what kind of incremental capital or operational changes you need to make to accommodate that? Lynn Good : So Steven, I think, we\u2019re capable of serving Amazon today with a really robust system in North Carolinas. We have pleasure to serve and expanding facility in Northern Kentucky that we\u2019re working closely with them on. The triangle area around that has been an important growth area for the company for some time. So we\u2019ll be anxious to put infrastructure in place with additional infrastructure is needed. And I think about our approach to economic development in general, we\u2019ve been very aggressive in our service territories making investments to attract businesses. And that will be our approach here as well if we get that opportunity for the Carolinas. Stephen Byrd : Thank you so much. If I could just maybe one more on changes to the grid. You\u2019ve been spending a lot of time and effort thinking about grid modernization in a number of ways. I\u2019m just curious, as you see it now; do you see incremental investment opportunities from grid modernization over and above which you\u2019ve already laid out? Or is that likely to be a relatively long evolution in terms of changes to be making there? Lynn Good : I believe we have a robust plan season where we have been disciplined in establishing business cases for each of these investments, to deliver benefits to customers whether it\u2019s regular customer experience whether it\u2019s reliability metrics. We do have the ability to change the timing, accelerate, slowdown depending upon the needs of customer needs in the jurisdictions. And I would expect as the system continues to grow, which we would see it doing over the next 10 years. The Southeast is attracting an incredible number of new citizens. People migrating to this area that will find continued opportunities to expand our system. So we have a team of people focusing on modernization as a full time assignment to ensure that we\u2019re growing the infrastructure that our safe count on, same for Indiana, same for Florida, same for Ohio. Stephen Byrd : Okay. Thank you very much. Lynn Good : Thank you. Steven Young : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Michael Weinstein : To what extent do you see the increase in earnings growth into 2019-2020 period has driven by the rate base increases coming from differed tax amortization? In terms of -- does that give you increased confidence in that ability to get back up to the mid high range, because this portion of the rate base growth is -- its not -- its uncertainty right? Lynn Good : Yes. And you know, Michael, I think, you can see the front end impact with the loss of interest shield and resolution. But as you look into our acquired debt -- looking at rate base growth, you can see $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion of rate base over that period. And that's about spending at all of capital. So if that rate base grows in the fundamental business that we operate, low risk high quality jurisdictions to give us confidence that need to maintain the 4% to 6% growth rate really actually [indiscernible] to tax reform in '18, get back within the range in '19, mid to high in '20 and beyond. So the point that you are making around the strength of the rate base curve is exactly right. Michael Weinstein : Great. And also maybe you could just comment a little bit about the tax equity market around Renewables after the big provisions in the tax reform package? Lynn Good : We believe we'll be successful in that market with our -- size of our company sale and credit profile. I think all of this is something that we'll continue to monitor. We\u2019re actually in the tax equity market right now with the projects and are seeing success and putting that together. So we are optimistic. Michael Weinstein : Are you seeing any additional opportunities, maybe coming your way as a result of smaller players as you are having a harder time gaining access to that market now? Lynn Good : Michael, there is a lot of opportunity flow that come through and compliments to the team to proceed to -- as they approach in a disciplined fashion to identify projects that makes sense for us, but we do see good opportunity flow. Michael Weinstein : Thank you very much. Lynn Good : Thank you. Steven Young : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Jonathan Arnold : Good morning, guys. Lynn Good : Hi, Jonathan. Steven Young : Good morning. Jonathan Arnold : When you talked about what you have assumed for the cash treatment of tax reform with regard to customer rates, it sounded like you were saying you've assumed you'll flow it back reasonably quickly, but then you talked several things during which would do the opposite. So is there any way you can give us a sort of a high level what's assumed in this FFO target versus the range of potential outcomes? Steven Young : Yes, Jonathan, we've looked at a number of outcomes and they may very per jurisdictions, certainly, we have a constructed outcome in Florida. In general, what we are thinking about here is that the impact of the rate decrease from the 35 to 21 will work that back through perspective rates and give that aspect to customers. We're looking at the excess differed tax piece; the protected piece will go back slowly. And we\u2019re looking at utilizing the other excess differed taxes to be used as a mid against the rate base increases that are coming as well to help reduce the volatility. That\u2019s a general way to think about the way we've incorporated this into our plans. Jonathan Arnold : So, for example, where you have rate cases pending at that point of 35 to 21 would be part of that case, and in other jurisdictions, it would be later, is that right? Lynn Good : Jonathan, I think, I'll try graph at Carolinas as Steve will trying here too. We not expecting the tax reform will be a part of the DEP case that we are expecting an order on anytime. There is a separate docket this tradition has established. Testimony will be presented in the DEC case around tax reform. And I think it's really an open question on whether or not itself within this case or in a separate docket. But I think in all events, there is an opportunity here to use tax reform, there was an impact of rising prices or investments in the state. The other state, some of them will go automatically in the place for your riders, so in Indiana and Ohio where there is a rider tracking mechanism, those tax reform impacts will go to meaningfully t-mark would be another example of that. And then we'll tailor other jurisdictions based on general rate case timing or separate dockets are established and fee settle will be really customized jurisdiction by jurisdiction. Jonathan Arnold : And can you jus touch on ACP in that context? Steven Young : The ACP project is benefitted by tax reform. Again, we've got several grades with our customers on ACP. And if this -- it's not a formula type rate there. And so that will be one of the things that benefits us more with the quotation to ACP. Lynn Good : And you may remember it's -- just one point on that. ACP was a competitive process early on with negotiated range that came out of the competitive bidding process. And ACP was selected as the most cost effective solution and continues to be the most cost effective solution for customers. Jonathan Arnold : To see that anticipate an adjustment there? Lynn Good : That's correct. Jonathan Arnold : Great. Thank you. And then could I just on -- just when I look at the FFO to debt, slide you show '18 then you showed '20 to '22, does that -- should we assume like '19 is sort of part of a bridge to that new number? Or does it go down a little of that improve? What's the sort of '19 profile as you fill in that gap? Steven Young : We will be improving on our metrics throughout the plan, Jonathan. I don\u2019t want to give you year-by-year guidance, but we do see an improvement throughout the plan. Lynn Good : It trends up from 2018, Jonathan. Jonathan Arnold : And have you had the opportunity to sort of download with the agencies on how the plan looks, now you've framed out some -- your equity piece? Lynn Good : Yes, we visited with all three of the agencies, Jonathan, in advance sharing with them our perspective, the actions we've taken not only the equity, but the reduction in capital, our focus on cost management, the demonstrating track record and pursuing regulatory recoveries. And we've had a very comprehensive discussion, we believe, we put forward incredible plan to the agencies that support our ratings. Of course, they will deliberate and put the guide of the coming months, but we feel like we've had a very good discussion of very incredible plan like this. Jonathan Arnold : Great. Thank you. And if I may digest the '18 you have 15% to 16% targeted effective tax rate. Is that the right bolt-on going beyond '18? Or is it still low -- is that lower than you think it will be? Steven Young : I think that's certainly what we see for '18. We typically don\u2019t project beyond that. I don\u2019t know that it's going to bare a lot from that as we go forward with them. Jonathan Arnold : Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Lynn. Lynn Good : Thank you. Steven Young : Sure. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Lynn Good : Good morning, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: I just wanted to follow-up and clean up a few items from past questions here. First, on the growth into \u201919 and then \u201920 beyond, just to make sure if I heard you right, mid to high-end in \u201820 and beyond. Is the right way to think about this that basically you\u2019re targeting a 7% rate base growth off of 2018 such as that get you to close-ish to 2019, the midpoint of that the range, as, I think, Shar initially asked. And then, again, as you roll forward take 7% net out a small amount of equity dilution and then again that\u2019s how you outperform the 4% to 6% from \u201919 into \u201920. Just want to make sure we\u2019re hearing the puts and takes appropriately here. Lynn Good : So, Julien, I would think about 2019 is being within the range, within the guidance range. I think the lower end of the guidance range would be the way to think about \u201919 as we\u2019re still getting into get that recovery of the increased rate base investment, because you think about \u201919 earnings is going to have to be rate case is prosecuted in \u201918 or certain of those jurisdictions. We will see the rider impact and other things. But within guidance, that\u2019s the way, I think about \u201919, and then by \u201920 mid to high, because we have an opportunity or another year of securing that revenue stream building on that rate base growth. And so $3.5 billion of additional rate base growth without spending and additional dollar of capital, and these jurisdictions, we believe underpins our ability to get in that range by 2020, mid to high. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great. Excellent. And then coming back to prior question on the Commercial side of the business, specifically Renewables, can you elaborate a little bit on what\u2019s driving. I think in the commentary you suggested that you would actually increase the size of investment, but then, perhaps, in some of the Q&A, if I hear you right a little bit more cautionary on tariffs et cetera, are you looking to expand this or is this really a statement around HB 589 and the opportunities there? Is this something beyond the Carolinas here that you guys are really seeing out there? Lynn Good : Julien, there is about $1 billion of investment in Commercial and Renewables last year. It is modestly higher than that this year. We have introduced half equity for the first time, you may recall. Before tax reform, we thought we will be a tax payer and someone who could use credit sooner than what\u2019s going to happen. And so we have looked at that business in the -- through the lens of tax equity. We do see opportunities from HB 589. And as we just clamp the implications of HB 589, we put that capital in the Commercial business for planning assumption. So I think our message here has been consistent. We liked the business; we have scale in the business. We believe we can invest in a manner that\u2019s profitable for our investors. And the modest increase in capital is HB 589 and other market opportunities. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. And just last nitpicking on the FFO to debt question real quickly, the 2018 number you show. Is that inclusive of the equity or should we be thinking about the jump, the ratable improvement from 14% up to the 15% to 16% range, the equity being a big chunk of that improvement. Just want to make sure what level of debt here? Lynn Good : The equity is in the FFO\u2026 Steven Young : Yes. The equity\u2026 Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Is reflected in that 14% already? Lynn Good : Yes. Steven Young : Yes. That\u2019s true. Lynn Good : Again, Julien, I think, as you know, an equity issuance impact is denominator, right. So it's going to have an impact on FFO, but it has more dramatic impact on our holding company debt, which, of course, will be declining over the five year period, so roughly, its 71%, so more aggressively than what we shared with you last year. The engine for production of FFO is our regulatory businesses and that is not changed in tax reform. So we will go after investment and delivering returns in a way that we historically have by delivering returns in regulated profits and that\u2019s the engine that drive the FFO growth over the period. Steven Young : That\u2019s right. And our ability to execute in our cost management has helped us to exceed the original estimates we have for 2018 in our credit metrics. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. Excellent. Thank you. Lynn Good : Okay. Thanks, Julien. Operator : We will take our next question from David Paz with Wolfe Research. Lynn Good : Hi, David. David Paz : Good morning. Just going back to the growth question, so looking on slide 12, when you say mid to high end of the growth target in 2020, is that the growth over 2019 earnings or is that a compounded average annual rate of the midpoint of your 2017 guidance? Lynn Good : It's all for '17, David. David Paz : Okay. Great. Thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : We take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hi, guys, more of a longer term question. How are you thinking about the jurisdictions where you have the most lag? What you can do to structurally change that to reduce that lag outside of just kind of continuing the bio cases on a pretty frequent basis? Lynn Good : Hi, Michael, I appreciate that question because we have drawn our attention to what we are calling regulatory modernization, which is trying to look at the regulatory mechanisms and match those mechanisms to the way investment occurs. So Indiana, Ohio, multiyear rate plans in Florida, all of those are very well seasoned to work with the type of investments that we're making in the grid and renewable, clean energy et cetera. The Carolinas is where we have a little bit of work to do. We're pleased with the result of HB 589, which puts trackers in place for renewable and for a proof of contract both of which were important. And we as you may recall have also filed for a tracker of around grid investment in our DEC case. Our intent is to follow on a dual path as we did with HB 589. And the commission, how far they believe they can go and then pursue legislation if need to finalize that work. I believe it\u2019s a win-win; the type of investments that we're making will deliver immediate customer benefits. It minimizes the impact on price to customers. And I believe with tax reform is another tool we should be able to find our way that something works for customers and for the investments we are trying to put in the place. So the focus of modernization is throughout all the jurisdictions, but we have some specific objectives we are trying to achieve in the Carolinas. Michael Lapides : Got it. And when you are looking at the Carolinas, how - what's in the feedback in the rate cases regarding the grid modernization tracker? Lynn Good : So publics have produced some testimony. They have some questions about what is modernization really question the type of investments. They like some of them better than others. We believe that there is a strong case throughout the program around modernization, but they also introduced the notion of the cap if the commission board will approve the tracker. So I believe there was a good start to a conversation that we will continue as part of this case. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Lynn. Much appreciated. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : Will go next to Praful Mehta with Citi. Praful Mehta : So I guess just bringing together both the groups trajectory that you've talked about here and the credit that you've laid out. Wanted to understand how tax reform and the discussion with the regulators fit in because you've kind of highlighted discussion around regulatory asset recovery, accelerated depreciation. So if any of those variables change and the discussions with regulators are, I guess, better than expected or worse than expected. Which variable should we look at that can impact either your earnings trajectory or your credit are putting more pressure on the balance sheet? How should we track that? Lynn Good : Praful, I'll get a start and turn it over to Steve. He and his team have worked extensively on the implications of tax reform really dating back into 2017. But you can appreciate anytime you put a five year plan together. You're putting it together with a range of assumptions and that's the case here as well. We won't have complete sure to be on the way the commissions are going to address tax reform until later into 2018. But as Steve indicated, we are assuming pretty current return or reduction in rates around the tax rate of 35% to 21%. And so I think that's the reasonable assumption that should play out in '18 and beyond in each jurisdiction. And then on the accumulated differed taxes, the protected ones go back overlay consistent with normalization way. And we are proposing that the unprotected differs go back over a rate we'll hear at times. And some of our jurisdictions are those differed taxes are actually related to property. So a longer period of time makes sense to us that, of course, will be subject to negotiation. And we will check and adjust, and we always do it depending on how that plays out, but believe we have reasonable planning assumptions. Steve? Steven Young : Right, I think, Lynn covered it very clearly there that's kind of how we look at it. I think that makes sense. This is an opportunity to reduce customer rates pretty quickly, but we also have an opportunity to here to utilize some of this, to offset some of the rate base increases that are coming, and we will be looking at excess differs as a tool for that. And that was what was done in Florida, I think, a very constructive settlement there. So we will see how it plays out on the other jurisdictions. Praful Mehta : So how big is the unprotected piece that needs to be refunded? And what assumption is being need on the timing of that refund? Steven Young : Unprotected differed taxes are about -- for the total corporation about $1.8 billion, protected are about $4.5 billion. Praful Mehta : I got you. And the assumption on the return of the unprotected, I'm assuming is quicker, obviously, because it's not the average life of asset. You have some unprotected foundries that are connected with any. But for the rest, is there -- is it like a five year period just to get a sense of what kind of timeframes just that refinance to take place in? Lynn Good : Praful, I would just say a reasonable timeframe at this point. We're early in the process of this discussion with our jurisdictions, and it's going to be jurisdiction by jurisdiction. As I said a moment ago, some of the riders' mechanisms will be treated differently in the general basis rate case. So as we've learned more in these dockets that are opened in front of the jurisdictions will be prepared to share more specifics on that, but believe that we put together a plan here with the reasonable set of outcome. Praful Mehta : Understood. Fair enough. And just quickly just last point on the holding company debt. It\u2019s going from 31% to 32%, I guess, in the 2020-2022 timeframe. That percentage, is that being achieved because the underlying denominator that is the total debt of the company is growing? Or is that being achieved because the holding company debt has been paid down during that timeframe? Lynn Good : It\u2019s really reflecting the benefit of the equity issuance, Praful. So we are delevering the holding company with the equity issuance. Praful Mehta : I got you. So apart from the initial pay down, there isn\u2019t anything incremental happening post the \u201918 timeframe in terms of delevering at the Holdco? Lynn Good : So there is a modest trending up ACP and other things and then down again. So that's the starting point in \u201918 and the ending point are flat. Praful Mehta : I got you. So I\u2019m just trying to confirm that post \u201919, is there any assumption of debt paydown at the Holdco or no? Lynn Good : Relatively flat end-to-end. We can probably take you through financing schedules after the call, Praful, if there is more detail that we can help you with. Praful Mehta : Understood. That's super helpful. Thank you very much. Lynn Good : All right. Thank you. Operator : At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Lynn Good, for any additional or closing remarks. A - Lynn Good : Great. Thank you. Thanks everyone for joining us today. We\u2019ll be available by phone and have an opportunity to meet with many of you over the next couple of weeks. I want to extend my thanks to the team who has put all this together with tax reform coming late in the year. It\u2019s been an all out effort. And we\u2019re really delighting to put it forward today. Thank you for your investments in Duke Energy. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

He will then provide an update on tax reform and our financing plan before closing with key investor considerations. With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Today we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.28, marking a strong start to 2018. It's clear our long-term strategy is delivering results. We made progress on our strategic investments and regulatory initiatives and continue to expand our electric and gas infrastructure businesses with solid customer and volume growth across our service areas. With these results, we remain on track to deliver our 2018 EPS guidance range of $4.55 to $4.85 per share and our long-term earnings growth CAGR of 4% to 6% through 2022. In response to tax reform and consistent with the plans we shared with you in February, we successfully executed a $1.6 billion equity offering in March. We also remain on track for the additional steps that we outlined, reducing capital by $1 billion over the five-year plan and maintaining a sharp focus on operational cost efficiency. Overall, I'm confident we have the right approach to financing our investments. And S&P reaffirmed our credit ratings and stable outlook in March. On this slide, we've also highlighted other notable accomplishments during the quarter that demonstrate the dedication of our employees and their focus on delivering affordable, safe, reliable, and increasingly clean energy. This was recognized by EEI [Edison Electric Institute], which ranked Duke Energy number one in safety in the industry for the third year in a row. And on May 1, Forbes honored our commitment to engaging, developing, and retaining our workforce, naming Duke Energy as a top employer. Turning to slide 5, let me provide an update on our regulatory activities during the quarter. Last year we filed two rate cases, one for Duke Energy Progress and one for Duke Energy Carolinas. In late February, the North Carolina Utilities Commission issued an order in our DEP case, approving new rates associated with our $8.1 billion rate base, including our investments in four new solar projects and gas-fired generation at Sutton and Asheville. The decision approved a 9.9% ROE on a 52% equity component of the capital structure. The order also clarified coal ash cost recovery. We received approval to amortize $234 million out of a requested $240 million in deferred costs over a five-year period and with a full debt and equity return. Ongoing coal ash costs will be deferred with a return and be considered in the next DEP rate case. Hearings in DEC ended in March, and in late April we filed a post-hearing brief reiterating our positions in the case. We used the opportunity to introduce a modified proposal of a grid rider for the commission's consideration. We also addressed our views regarding tax reform. We proposed reducing customer rates, accounting for the lower federal income tax rate, and returning unprotected access deferred income taxes to customers over 5 to 20 years. The timeline is dependent upon the nature of the items that created the deferral. Finally, we requested to offset a portion of the revenue decrease with the amortization of regulatory assets, accelerated depreciation, or recovery of environmental expenditures. We believe our proposals included in the post-hearing brief strike an appropriate balance of delivering value to customers while providing returns to investors and maintaining the strength of the utility's balance sheet. A decision is expected in late May or early June. In Ohio, we filed a settlement agreement in April, which addresses both the electric distribution rate case and our pending ESP proceeding. It includes the extension of our distribution capital investment rider through 2025, giving us clear line of sight for recovery of our investments. The rider is subject to increasing revenue caps through 2025. In addition, the settlement establishes a new PowerForward rider to recover costs to enhance the customer experience and further transform the grid, including investments as a result of the Ohio Commission's own PowerForward initiative. Also in April, we received a positive order from the Kentucky Public Service Commission in our electric base rate case. It established a new rider to recover environmental expenditures, including those related to coal ash. We have made clear progress achieving constructive regulatory outcomes, including modernizing our regulatory constructs. We continue to demonstrate our ability to work with stakeholders to achieve balanced solutions that benefit customers and support our growth plan. Moving to slide 6, I want to provide an update on our efforts to transform the way we generate energy. With three new natural gas plants either online or under construction, we're committed to reducing our carbon footprint and leveraging the overlap between our electric and gas businesses. Our W.S. Lee plant, located in South Carolina, began serving customers on April 5, with our Piedmont subsidiary delivering gas using new infrastructure put in place for the project. In Florida, we expect Citrus County to begin operations soon, with Unit 1 online in the fall and unit 2 by the end of the year. This plant, totaling 1,600 megawatts, will allow us to retire two coal-fired units at Crystal River. In April, we filed a request with the Florida Public Service Commission to recover our investment in Citrus County via the GBRA mechanism once the units are placed in service. Our filing included an increase to the revenue requirement of approximately $200 million per year. New rates are expected to be fully updated in the fourth quarter. Our Western Carolinas modernization project is progressing and remains on track for an expected 2019 in-service date. We're also investing in our Commercial Renewables business. We anticipate our 25-megawatt Shoreham solar facility to come online in the second quarter, one of the largest solar projects in New York. This is our first project in New York and expands our Commercial Renewables footprint to 14 states. We put tax equity financing in place for this project and will continue to use this funding source moving forward. In addition to these clean energy projects, we recently issued two key reports, our annual Sustainability Report and our Climate Report. The Climate Report outline steps we're taking to mitigate risks from climate change and includes analysis of a 2-degree scenario. Importantly, our current plan to achieve a 40% carbon reduction by 2030 is consistent with the pathway to achieving this 2-degree scenario. This new report is another example of our longstanding commitment to the environment and our stakeholders. Moving to slide 7, let me update you on our natural gas business. We made significant progress on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline in the first quarter, completing approximately 200 miles of tree-felling along the 600-mile route, or approximately 75% of the miles planned for 2018. The remaining miles will be addressed later this fall when the tree-felling window opens again. In April, we received FERC approval to begin full construction on the Northampton Compressor Station in North Carolina. This marks the second of three compressor stations for which we have full construction approval, representing another meaningful step for the project. We also requested approval from FERC to start full construction on the West Virginia portion of the pipeline, where tree-felling has been completed or was not required. While we await the final state permits in Virginia, these milestones keep the project on track for a fourth quarter 2019 in-service date. Turning to Sabal Trail, the lateral line to our Citrus County natural gas plant is in service, allowing us to begin operational testing prior to bringing the plant online to serve customers. FERC reissued the certificate for Sabal Trail, reaffirming that the project will not result in a significant impact on the environment. Recently, the project partners successfully completed the permanent financing, raising approximately $1.5 billion to return capital to the project owners now that construction is complete. Duke's share of the proceeds is approximately $100 million. Finally, one quick note on the recent FERC NOPR regarding tax reform, Duke Energy's midstream investments in ACP and Sabal Trial are over 90% contracted with negotiated rates and 20 to 25-year contracts. We believe the proposed rulemaking does not impact our projects. As I turn it over to Steve, our results for this quarter show that the fundamentals of our business remain strong and we are well-positioned as we move ahead in 2018. Our industry continues to transform, requiring us to execute, anticipate, and adapt. That remains our focus, as we invest in infrastructure our customers' value and deliver sustainable growth for our investors. We're delivering on our strategy and I remain confident in our vision to be the leading energy infrastructure company. So, Steve, let me turn it to you. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thanks, Lynn. Let's start with quarterly results. I will cover the highlights on slide 8 and discuss our adjusted earnings per share variances compared to the prior-year quarter. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year and a reconciliation of reported results to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. On a reported or GAAP basis, 2018 first quarter earnings per share were $0.88 compared to $1.02 last year. First quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share was $1.28 compared to $1.04 in the prior year. The most significant drivers of the difference between reported and adjusted earnings in the quarter were charges related to the sale of the retired Beckjord plant in Ohio; the recognition of a valuation allowance related to the Tax Act; charges related to the DEP rate order; and an impairment of Duke Energy's investment in the Constitution Pipeline. Higher adjusted results in the quarter were principally due to weather, as well as growth in our electric and gas businesses. Within the segments, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure results were up $0.26 compared to the prior year. Weather was the primary driver with a $0.16 increase, as we returned to more normal weather in the first quarter compared to the warmer winter weather a year ago. We also had higher retail revenues from pricing and riders, primarily driven by three factors; generation base rate or GBRA increases in Florida that took effect last year related to our Hines and Osprey facilities; grid riders in the Midwest; and the recovery of qualifying facility power purchases through the fuel rider in North Carolina as a result of HB 589. We also saw higher retail electric volumes in the quarter, which I'll discuss in more detail in a moment. O&M was favorable $0.04 in the quarter, but this favorability is expected to reverse in future quarters. Finally, the Electric segment benefited from lower income tax expense of $0.06, including impacts of the Tax Act. A portion of this benefit is related to tax levelization and is expected to reverse later this year, as excess deferred income taxes are reflected in customer rates. Higher depreciation and amortization expense partially offset the positive drivers, primarily due to growth in the asset base. Shifting to our Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment, results were up $0.03 for the quarter. The increase was largely driven by customer growth and increased investments at Piedmont, including higher rate base from integrity management investments and required infrastructure for our W.S. Lee plant. This is another example of the complementary nature of our electric and gas businesses. In Commercial Renewables, we were down $0.01 for the quarter. This was driven by lower wind resources compared to last year. Finally, Other was down $0.04 due to higher interest expense at the holding company and higher income tax expense, including a lower tax shield on HoldCo interest as a result of the Tax Act. The lower tax shield and other impacts on the new law across our business segments, including the timing of these impacts, are consistent with our full-year 2018 planning assumptions. Overall, we had a very solid start to the year and look forward to delivering on our plan in the coming quarters. Turning to slide 9, let me walk you through our retail volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather-normalized retail electric load growth was 0.6%, consistent with our long-term planning assumption of 0.5%. The residential class exhibited particular strength, growing 1.9% on a rolling 12-month basis. Importantly, load grew faster than the number of customers this quarter, indicating usage growth per customer. We see this as a positive economic indicator and will continue to closely track customer usage trends. Population growth remains strong in our service territories, especially in Florida and North Carolina, which were ranked among the top five states for population gains in 2017. We were also encouraged to see strength in the Cincinnati metro area, and Nashville remains one of the fastest growing cities in the country. As we look ahead, positive trends in employment and wages and continued strength in the housing market are expected to drive ongoing residential growth. Residential building permit activity remains high, especially in the single-family category. In the commercial class, sales across our jurisdictions were slightly down over the rolling 12 months. We continue to see some weakness in large retailers as they compete with online offerings. Yet, strength in leisure and hospitality businesses have offset this to some degree. Small business confidence remains high, providing optimism for future growth in this sector. Turning to industrials, on a rolling 12-month basis, the sector declined 0.5%. This decrease is primarily due to production declines at a couple of large customers in the middle of last year and recent outage activities. Industries that support sales to consumers, such as construction and housing, continue to perform well, which partially offsets the decline. On a macro level, positive economic growth is a tailwind, with leading economic indicators remaining high. Overall, we remain confident in our long-term assumption of 0.5% retail load growth in our electric utilities and continue to be optimistic for the economic prospects within our service territories. Shifting to slide 10, we are making progress in addressing tax reform across our jurisdictions. As we said in February, our approach is to target solutions that provide benefits to customers while smoothing customer rate volatility and supporting the credit quality of the utilities. In several of our jurisdictions, we have proposed using a portion of the lower tax expense to accelerate depreciation, recover environmental costs, or amortize regulatory assets. Our solution at Duke Energy Florida is a great example of this. Earlier this year, we received commission approval to use tax reform benefits to offset Hurricane Irma costs and accelerate the depreciation of older coal-fired generation units. Elsewhere, revenues recovered via riders will be updated for the lower federal income tax rate as the rider filings are made in the ordinary course. The remaining portions of the tax law, including the treatment of excess deferred income taxes, are being addressed in separate tax reform dockets or in base rate case proceedings. In DEC North Carolina, we expect the commission to address tax reform in our pending rate case and look forward to the commission's decision in the coming weeks. For DEP North Carolina, we recommended addressing tax reform in the next rate case proceedings. Our proposals and rate outcomes today on tax reform are consistent with the objectives we outlined on our fourth quarter call. We will continue to respond to our state regulators and other stakeholders in the coming months as these proceedings progress. Next, let me take a moment on slide 11 to discuss the strength of our balance sheet. As Lynn mentioned, in early March we successfully executed a $1.6 billion equity offering, which included a full exercise of the overallotment option by the underwriters. We also issued $50 million of equity via the DRIP in the first quarter. We will issue the remaining $350 million for 2018 using both the DRIP and our ATM program. Recall that beyond 2018, we intend to continue issuing $350 million of equity per year for the remainder of the five-year plan. We remain on track to achieve our FFO-to-debt target by 2020. In addition to the equity issuances, our cash flow profile and credit quality are further supported by our regulatory modernization efforts and an active regulatory calendar. This cash flow support includes recovery of deferred coal ash costs, which we are now recovering from our DEP North Carolina and South Carolina retail customers as well as our wholesale customers. I would also like to remind folks of the material cash flow benefit related to our $1.1 billion of AMT credits that are now refundable under the Tax Act. Beginning in 2019, the value of these credits will be refunded to the company regardless of whether or not we have taxable income. The legislation front-loads the refund schedule, with 50% of the unused credits refundable each year. This has a significant positive effect on our funds from operations over the refund period. We've also included in our appendix more information on the FFO-to-debt metric, including the implications of coal ash spend, Crystal River 3 securitization, and the effects of purchase accounting. We share these adjustments and the logic behind them with the rating agencies on a regular basis. S&P took a constructive view of the credit quality of the company in March, affirming Duke Energy's current ratings and keeping the company on a stable outlook. In its report, the agency noted two items as credit positive, the commission's approval of coal ash recovery in the DEP rate case order and our commitment to issue equity, including $2 billion of equity in 2018. Going forward, the agencies will look for continued constructive regulatory outcomes and execution of our long-term plan. We believe a strong balance sheet is necessary to invest on behalf of our customers and investors, and we have taken an important steps to support our credit quality. We remain confident in our equity financing plan. It is sufficient to support the strength of the balance sheet and our growth investments, and we do not expect to issue additional equity over the remaining $350 million per year in the five-year plan. Before I close, I want to take a moment to remind you of our long-term earnings growth guidance, as shown on slide 12. Our long-term earnings growth CAGR of 4% to 6% through 2022 is based off of $4.60 per share in 2017, the midpoint of our original 2017 guidance. While the midpoint of this year's guidance range is below this growth rate, we expect to be back to the low end of the 4% to 6% CAGR by next year. As our higher rate base growth and regulatory recovery accumulates, we expect to be at the mid to high end of the range in 2020 and beyond. I'll close with our investor value proposition on slide 13. We continue to offer an attractive 8% to 10% shareholder return that balances the 4% to 6% earnings growth with a strong and growing dividend. Our growth is driven by low-risk regulated investments that are supported by our strong balance sheet. Our attractive yield and demonstrated ability to reliably grow our regulated businesses position Duke Energy as the leading infrastructure investment. With that, let's open the line for your questions. Operator : We'll first go to Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Steve, you may have given more on this than I picked up in the remarks, so I apologize if that's the case. But I was just wondering if you could give us a little more color into the benefits of tax reform that are retained in the Utilities and Infrastructure segment this quarter, perhaps quantify how much that was, how it's arising, and then to what extent you expect it to be an incremental benefit during the rest of the year. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: What we saw in the quarter looking AVA [Average Value Analysis], we saw $0.06 favorability related to income taxes. A couple of things are going on there. I mentioned the accounting levelization rules require smoothing of tax benefits over the year, and that accounts for $0.02 or $0.03 of that favorability. We also utilized some tax optimization efforts that helped provide some benefits in income tax as well. But there is the levelization that will turn around to the extent I described. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: And, Jonathan, maybe just to add to that, the overall guidance that we provided in February for the impact of tax reform, we are on track for that. What you're seeing is just some quarter-to-quarter levelization resulting from the application of GAAP, but we are on track with the guidance we gave you in February. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, so that incorporates some earnings pickup from the fact that the riders won't be implemented till they get implemented and the DEP happening in the next case. Am I my understanding that right? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: The cash flow implications of retaining those benefits would be reflected in the results. We are deferring in every jurisdiction, I believe, Steve, tax benefits. So you can think about it as cash flow financing benefit, Jonathan. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, so what you're calling out as an earnings driver is purely the timing. It's not the cash benefit. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: That's right. What is an earnings driver here is the levelization primarily that Lynn described. There have been some tax optimization efforts that are in the results. That's separate from the Tax Act issue. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thank you for that. And just one other topic, can you give us an update of how you feel about your goals that you've laid out in Commercial Renewables and just the state of the market competitive-wise there? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Jonathan, we're on track in 2018 in the Commercial Renewables segment. The variance that you see in the quarter is more weather-related, but the backlog of projects and what we expect to close in 2018 remains on track. As you know, it's a competitive market, and we expect it to continue to be. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thank you very much. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : All right. Next we'll go to Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Quick question, the 15% to 16% FFO-to-debt target for 2020 to 2022 and 14% for 2018, how much would that be impacted if \u2013 how much of that is dependent on the outcome of the DEP case? How could it change positive or negative as a result of the outcome? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Well, I think the DEP case was very constructive. I think it's overall in line with our expectations as a whole... Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I'm sorry, but the DEC case. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Okay. We've modeled a number of scenario outcomes. The DEC case we'll learn about in a few weeks, but I think we have a number of levers to pull to still meet our credit metrics over our plan. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Michael, if you look at the DEP case, a very constructive outcome addressing all of the capital, substantially all of the deferred coal ash. We believe we put on a very strong case for DEC, and we'll know more on the specifics late May or June, but I think the precedent established in the DEP case is how you should think about DEC. And then tax reform would be the addition to DEC that I would point to, and we were specific in our recommendations around tax reform in our post-hearing brief that we filed at the end of April. Our intent has always been that customers should see the benefit of the reduction in rates from 35% to 21%, and we have proposed an amortization period for the unprotected, which we think strikes a good balance. So as Steve said, we always model a variety of scenarios on these things, but feel like we're on track to deliver those metrics, and we're certainly committed to do that. And if at any point there's a timing or shortfall, we do have levers, as Steve indicated, to make sure we remain on track. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Just to follow up on that, the real question is, the current equity issuance of $2 billion target for this year, does that incorporate even your worst-case scenarios for the outcome of the case, or is there a possibility there might be more? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Yes, it does. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, thank you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Michael, I think the thing I would think about on tax reform, which is really probably the most significant open item because we don't yet have commission approval, it comes down to the treatment of the unprotected deferred taxes. And so we're not talking about a wide degree of variability for a company of our size. And we're talking about amortization periods ranging from 5 years to 20 years that we proposed. So I think it's important to bound that uncertainty exposure as you think about our confidence. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got you, but you've bounded \u2013 possible outcomes on the unprotected tax refunds are built into that equity issuance plan, right? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Absolutely. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, good. Thank you. Operator : And next we'll go to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning, Steve. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, good morning. Good morning, Lynn. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : So just first, do you have any sense from Moody's on when they might revisit the negative outlook given the equity issuance you did and the like? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Steve, we can't project with certainty what Moody's timing is. The one thing I would point to though is that their report earlier this year and your outlook action was really centered around tax reform. So I would expect as we move through the resolution of the DEC case, you'll get a clear picture of North Carolina. We already have Florida dialed in. Kentucky is visible, and we have dockets open in both Ohio and Indiana. So I feel like more information is going to become available over the next several months around tax reform in our larger jurisdictions, and we'll certainly be anxious to share all of that with Moody's. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay, great. And then the $1.1 billion of refundable AMT credits, so in 2019 and 2020, are you just essentially getting tax money, essentially refunds from the government on taxes? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yes, that's correct. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: That's correct. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Overall, because you also have your NOL and other... Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: We're getting that as cash. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And then just technically the $1.1 billion, that's a direct number. That's not like a \u2013 do we tax effect that, or is that a direct? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: That's a direct number. That's (32:01). Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Direct cash, okay. Okay, thank you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you, Steve. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: All right. Operator : And next we'll go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. So I wanted to follow up on a couple of things. First, if we can go to the modernization side of the equation, starting with Ohio, PowerForward, obviously that's success on that front. Does that change your CapEx at all? Obviously, it wouldn't be too meaningful. And then secondly, related to that, can you talk on the outcome of the latest rate cases in the Carolinas and to what extent that might shift things? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: So we're pleased with the result of the settlement in Ohio, Julien, but we need to get through a commission process. So there are hearings in July, but feel good about the settlement we were able to bring to the table. I think the PowerForward part of that rider will include projects that will impact customer experience, so our replacement of customer systems will be included in there. But we'd also expect the Ohio Commission, as they continue their work on their initiatives, to perhaps identify some things that we could invest in. Those would be incremental to our plan. So overall, I would look at the result \u2013 the settlement in Ohio as being consistent with our plan with modest upside. And in the Carolinas, I think we talked a number of times about grid investment being a priority in the Carolinas. We'll be watching closely the results of the DEC case and then determining our strategy for legislation in 2019 and beyond to see if there's additional legislative certainty that we need to provide in order to set a pathway for further investment in the Carolinas. So that's what I would share with you about modernization in the Carolinas. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. And then turning back to the overall guidance, not to wordsmith things too much, but I just wanted to understand what you're saying about 2019 guidance. Last time, I think you guys talked about being \"within the guidance range by 2019.\" And I think this go around, you talk about being back to the lower end of the 4% to 6%. Is that something to do with the timing of the equity and within the plan, or am I just being too nitpicky here? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Julien, the message has been the same. If you go back and reference where we were in February, it has always been low end of the range in 2019 and then mid-to-high in 2020 and beyond as we see the rate base growth and the investment and so on. So no change in message, but we'll be at the low end of the range in 2019. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent. Sorry, just quick nitpicky thing on the tax side real quickly. Obviously Ohio, that issue I think got pushed out from the settlement conversations. What's the latest expectation on resolving that? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: There's a docket in Ohio. I'd expect it to move through a process in 2018, Julien, but I don't have anything more specific than that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Excellent, thank you all very much, best of luck. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : All right, next we'll go to Ali Agha with SunTrust. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you, good morning. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Good morning. First, Steve, I wanted to just make sure I had heard something earlier when you talked about first quarter and some timing-related issues. One was tax levelization, as you clarified. If I heard you right as well, I think you mentioned there was about a $0.04 pickup in O&M, also timing related that would reverse over the course of the year. Did I hear that right? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yes, that's correct. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: We've seen some favorable O&M in the first quarter, but some of that was related to timing of purchases and so forth, so that may turn around. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, got it. And then secondly, when I look at the rate base data that you've given us through 2022, at least just looking at that data, it appears that the growth in rate base actually slows down 2020 and beyond. So I'm just wondering how to reconcile that with the point that earnings growth should actually accelerate 2020 and beyond. So how do we reconcile those two things? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Ali, I would first think about 2020 as being the completion of a number of important projects that we'll begin to see impact and then fuller impact. So ACP, Western Carolina, the step-in in Florida, the riders in Ohio and Indiana, environmental spend in Indiana. And then as you get further out in the period, we will continue to drive investment in our strategic priority areas of grid, clean energy, gas, and renewables. And those plans will be more fine-tuned as time progresses. What we've given you is ranges and expectations, but we will fine-tune the numbers in 2021 and 2022 as we get closer. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. And last question, Lynn, remind us also. When is the next big rate case cycle that we should think about once you're done with the North Carolina cases now over this planning period? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: So as I think about jurisdictions, we're set in Florida if the settlement is improved. Ohio is in good shape. We just finished a case in Kentucky. We have a number of trackers in Indiana. We continue to think about is it time to come in for a full case, so that's something that will be under evaluation. And then the Carolinas, we'll be anxious to see the results of the DEC case, and that will inform our timing. But as we've talked about a number of times, we believe the investment profile in the Carolinas matched with great value and benefits to customers is a good one. We're looking for ways we can modernize the construct. And in the interim, we'll be filing cases to deliver returns to investors and match those benefits to customers. So we'll have more specifics though on the timing after we digest the DEC case. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it, thank you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Now we'll go to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thank you for... Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hello. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, Lynn. Thank you guys for taking my call \u2013 my question. I actually have a couple. The first one is can you quantify under tax reform and the tax law changes at a companywide level for your regulated operating companies? And I'm just looking for the total company level, not by subsidiary. What is the excess or unprotected add/fit (38:43), that balance? What do you estimate that to be, that likely over multiple, multiple years will likely get refunded back to customers? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: We've got about $6.3 billion of excess deferreds on our books, Michael, total company. And of that, about $4.5 billion is protected, and unprotected is about $1.8 billion. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So the $4.5 billion should qualify under normalization like we saw after the 1986 Tax Act and go back to customers over a long life period, and the other staff, it's more negotiable? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: That's correct. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you. The other thing, and this is more of a regulatory or rate-making question. When you look at your capital spend forecast over the next couple years, how much of that \u2013 is there a rule of thumb of how much of that capital spend is covered via trackers or riders versus covered via traditional historical looking rate case processes? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: It will vary per jurisdiction, Michael. Certainly, we have a number of trackers in the Midwest that cover a lot of the capital there. We got the multiyear rate planning in Florida that provides us very efficient recovery. The Carolinas, the larger jurisdiction which has a lot of the CapEx, has fewer trackers at this point in time. So it's hard to give a rule of thumb there for the enterprise as a whole. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Michael, in the Carolinas, as you know, modernizing has been a priority. So if you think about HB 589, we now do have tracking mechanisms in the Carolinas around renewables, and we've put in front of the commission grid tracking. So our objective over the five-year period is to make progress in the Carolinas. But I think if you look at the Midwest and Florida, substantial, over 50%, 60%, 70% perhaps are covered by trackers in those jurisdictions. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it, thank you, Lynn. And thank you, Steve, much appreciated. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Sure. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And next we'll go to Praful Mehta with Citi. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks very much. Hi, guys. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Hello. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So, Steve, just to clarify \u2013 and by the way, slide 23 is very helpful in terms of the deferred taxes. But just to clarify, on that $1.8 billion of unprotected, what amount do we have clarity right now of the five years, and what amount is uncertain in terms of the timing of the refund? And the reason for the question, just to give you the context, is I was just trying to figure out where in that FFO-to-debt range can your metrics vary depending on the outcome of the deferred income taxes. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Sure. Of the $1.8 billion of unprotected excess deferreds, about $1.1 billion is at DEC and about $300 million is at Duke Energy Progress, so the bulk of it is in the Carolinas. The remaining portions are in Indiana and Florida. So the big piece of that is in the Carolinas. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: And I think, Praful, as you think about this DEC case, we'll get some visibility into the unprotected for DEC within the next couple months. And we've put forward a proposal of amortization between 5 and 20 years, tying that amortization period to the asset class, the nature of the items that resulted in the deferred taxes. And as I've said a moment ago, we'll learn more from the commission as we see the results in the DEC rate case. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you, fair enough. That makes sense. But just so if there is pushback or a request for faster refunds than what you have currently assumed, I guess, in your metrics, your FFO-to-debt metrics, does that put pressure on credit at all, or do you think most scenarios that you can get back in terms of the rate case or the settlement are kind of incorporated within your current plan? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Praful, we're confident on this. If you think about $1.1 billion over a 5 year or 10-year period and the scale of the company, the amount of capital we spend, the regulatory activity that we have to generate cash flow, we feel like we have scenarios and levers that we can exercise and manage variability. So I'd leave it at that. Steve? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Right, I would echo that as well. We have efforts under capital optimization looking at our O&M spend that can help offset this, just a number of levers to pull. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you, fair enough. That's helpful. And then secondly on tax equity, I saw that with one of your solar projects, you're looking at tax equity financing, and you mentioned this will be a bigger part going forward. It sounds like it makes sense given your cash tax profile. How attractive is the tax equity market right now? How big a player do you look to be in that tax equity? I'm assuming that is a part of your FFO-to-debt strategy as well to improve metrics. So just a little bit of color around that would be helpful. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Sure, the tax equity market is still very viable. It is in fact being used at our Shoreham facility, our solar farm in New York, and we'll continue to utilize that. As you mentioned, our tax position puts us as a candidate for that. And I think the markets there, it is an important part of our Commercial Renewables profile. So we'll utilize that as we go forward. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Praful, the capital that we laid out with you in February is still a good planning assumption for Commercial Renewables. We just look at tax equity as a tool we'll use to put that capital to work. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you, fair enough. Thanks so much, guys, I appreciate it. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Sure. Operator : Next we'll go to Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hey, good morning, guys. My question is... Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Shar. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hi. Lynn, my questions were just answered. Thanks so much. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: All right, thank you. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: All right. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Bye, guys. Operator : Okay. We'll go to Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning, Paul. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: At renewables, you were down $0.01, which you attributed to wind resource. Was that a net number? In other words, did you have growth from incremental projects more than offset by more than $0.01 of core wind resource? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yes, that's a net number. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Assuming wind resource had been flat, what would the segment have done? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: I'd have to look at that a little bit further, Paul. But the results were down $0.01, and that's primarily due to wind resource and there's some additional resources, but it's not significant. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay, thank you. And then back to Steve's question, the $1.1 billion of AMTs, so what net number will you be receiving from the IRS next year? Do you expect the full $550 million? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yes, in the range of that amount, 50% of the $1.1 billion, we'll get that next year. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: And that's net of what you'll be paying the IRS. In other words, you'll be not a cash taxpayer? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: That's the amount from the AMT, and we're not a cash taxpayer on any other front. And the AMT... Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: ...is not tied to taxable income in any way. It's just an amount you get regardless of where you're at on your tax return. Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning, Lynn and Steve. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Chris. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I appreciate the extra detail on Atlantic Coast. That was very helpful. Thank you for that, just a couple clarifications. Could you maybe give us a little bit more on how you're feeling in North Carolina about the grid mod rider? Staff didn't like it but did admit that they would prefer that it has a cost cap and some other conditions if they did approve it. So how are you feeling there, and how much does the tax benefits to the customers in general kind of weigh in on commission and intervener thinking there? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: So on the grid investment, Chris, I think what we saw in the hearing is just a continuation of a good discussion about the nature of the investments, the benefits they can deliver, the impact on customer bills. And so as we put together our post-hearing brief, we really addressed a number of the issues that were expressed during the hearing process and put in front of the commission what I would call kind of a step-in for the rider, a three-year proposal with a cap that was responsive to the feedback that we received. So I would think about this as being a continuation of our strategy to keep the conversation going about the grid. I actually think there's a very little disagreement about the need for the investment. I think the benefits to customers are clear, and we are trying to find the right way to put that investment in place for the benefit of customers in a way that makes sense to the commission, public staff, et cetera. I think tax reform represents a great opportunity because you have an opportunity to reduce impact to customers, at the same time you're driving investment. So I think they're complementary in that regard. And so we look forward to continuing the dialogue. And as we've shared previously, we have thought about the grid investment and modernization as being dual-track. Focusing on the regulatory process certainly, but also having legislation is something that we would also consider as we continue our work to modernize regulation. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, that's helpful. I think we'll have to wait and see there. And then just two tax clarification questions, when do you expect to become a cash taxpayer again? And I guess that question would exclude any noise from the AMT credit you're getting the next two years. And then the second question is just on the South Carolina approval from the commission on tax reform there. Do you pay a return to customers on the deferred balance? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: On the first question, we do not expect to be a cash taxpayer in our five-year plan, so it's after 2022 when that happens. And help me on your second question again on South Carolina. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So you guys just got the okay a couple weeks back to defer taxes and not have it addressed by the commission until your next rate case filings there. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yes. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : In the interim, do you pay a return on that deferred tax liability owed to customers? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: No, we're just deferring those costs at this point. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Then the commission will determine how to deal with that at that time of the proceeding. We're just deferring those benefits right now. Christopher James Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, that's good to hear. Thank you, guys. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: All right, thanks, Chris. Operator : And it looks like we have no further questions at this time, so I'd like to turn it back over to Ms. Lynn Good, for any closing remarks. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: We want to thank everyone for participating, good questions today. We look forward to connecting with you over the next several weeks. And I appreciate your investment and interest in Duke Energy. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone again, for their participation.",

Analysts: Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Maheep Mandloi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Duke Energy Second Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Callahan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Callahan - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you, Cathy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Duke Energy's second quarter 2018 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO, along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the Safe Harbor statement which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today's materials. Please note, the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. As summarized on slide 3, during today's call, Lynn will discuss progress we've made executing on our 2018 commitments. She will also provide an update on our North Carolina regulatory activity and our strategic investments. Steve will then provide an overview of our second quarter financial results and insight about economic and load growth trends. He will also give an update on tax reform and our financing plan before closing with key investor considerations. With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Let me began on slide 4 and summarize what has been a very productive first half of the year. We are delivering on our 2018 commitments in key areas across the business. As of June, we have resolved both rate cases in our home state of North Carolina. The DEC order was issued on June 22, following the first quarter order received in the Duke Energy progress case. North Carolina is a constructive jurisdiction, demonstrating a commitment to affordable and reliable power for our customers and financial strength for our utilities. During the quarter, we also continued to make progress on the resolution of Federal tax reform in our jurisdictions. The clarity we have received is consistent with the plans we described to you in February. We now have direction from our regulators in Florida, the Carolinas and Kentucky. In addition, we are awaiting approval of a settlement filed in Indiana and a proposal submitted in Ohio. Based on these results, we have updated our credit metric forecasts. We now expect our FFO-to-debt metrics to be in our target range of 15% to 16% in 2019, a year earlier than previously estimated. We are pleased to see that as of yesterday, Moody's has removed the negative outlook and affirmed our current ratings at the holding company, recognizing the benefits of Duke's scale, our constructive regulatory jurisdictions and our response to tax reform. As we execute on our long-term strategy, we are on track to achieve our financial objectives. With strong results for the first half of the year, we are reaffirming our 2018 EPS guidance range of $4.55 to $4.85 and our long-term earnings growth CAGR of 4% to 6% through 2022. We expect to be at the low-end of the range in 2019 and at the mid to high-end of the range in 2020 and beyond. We also increased our quarterly dividend by 4.2%. This is in line with our objective to grow dividends consistent with our long-term earnings growth range. Turning to slide 5, I'll provide the detail on the order received in June for our Duke Energy Carolinas rate case. Resolution of both the DEC and DEP rate cases in 2018 provides clarity, as we continue investing to benefit our customers. The commission approved new rates for our $13.5 billion DEC rate base with rates effective yesterday. Similar to the DEP decision received in February, the order approved a 9.9% ROE on a 52% equity component of the capital structure. We also received approval to recover deferred coal ash costs over a five-year period, with the full debt and equity return. Ongoing coal ash costs will be deferred with a return and be considered in the next rate case. Specific to DEC, the order approved the cancellation of the Lee Nuclear project as originally envisioned and recovery of development costs over a 12-year period without a return. We will maintain the combined operating license as an option for possible future development. The order also addressed Federal tax reform. Rates will be reduced for the lower income tax rate and the commission will consider the treatment of excess deferred income taxes in three years or in the next rate case, whichever is sooner. This is a constructive outcome that balances providing immediate benefits to customers with supporting credit quality at the utility. Finally, the order addressed grid investment. The commission noted that maintaining adequate and reliable electric service includes staying abreast of the latest developments in technology and equipment. The order deemed it reasonable and prudent to deploy smart meters on a full scale basis. It also approved deferral of costs associated with our new customer information system, the digital platform that will allow us to tailor new solutions for customers. And though we were disappointed, the order denied a request for a Grid Reliability and Resiliency Rider, arguing the commission lacked statutory authority in this instance, the commission encourages ongoing grid investment and our efforts to collaborate with stakeholders. Moving forward, we will continue advancing the dialogue with key stakeholders to enhance North Carolina's regulatory framework for recovery of grid investments. This infrastructure will provide significant benefits to our customers, including improved customer control and convenience, and cyber and physical security enhancements while creating thousands of jobs and supporting the state's economy. In addition, our customers' have expressed clear interest in battery storage and other reliability investments, as well as new technologies that enable distributed generation and energy efficiency. We will build on the momentum from our efforts over the last year including the grid settlement with environmental groups in our DEC rate case and generate even broader support for grid investment that aligns with our customers' interests. Moving to slide 6, let me provide an update on some of our other strategic investments. Construction continues in our 1,600 megawatt Citrus County combined-cycle plant in Florida. We have begun commissioning activities. And yesterday, we achieved first fire on Power Block 1, a significant milestone for the project. We are on track to place Unit 1 in service this fall with Unit 2 following by the end of the year. On July 10, the Florida Public Service Commission approved our requested $200 million revenue increase for the plant under the GBRA mechanism. New rates are expected to be implemented the month following the in-service dates. Also in Florida, we filed our first petitions under the solar-based rate adjustment mechanism for two new solar projects. The projects totaling 149 megawatts are expected to come online in December 2018 and March 2020. The requested revenue requirement for the two projects is approximately $30 million. Our Western Carolinas modernization project is progressing well and remains on track for the expected 2019 in-service date. This project fits squarely within our strategic priorities. We are replacing aging coal units with new natural gas-fired generation and utility scale solar and updating transmission and distribution assets, including adding battery storage. We continue to look for opportunities to apply similar solutions elsewhere in our jurisdictions. In July, we launched the first request for proposal for new renewable energy resources in North Carolina under House Bill 589. This 680 megawatt solicitation seeks projects capable of being placed in service by the end of 2020. Bids are due September 11. Recall that Duke can participate in the RFPs with proposals from our Utilities and Commercial Renewables business, subject to certain restrictions. In Commercial Renewables, our 25 megawatt Shoreham Solar facility on Long Island, New York, achieved commercial operation in the third quarter, and we have closed the tax equity financing for this project. Turning to our Gas business on slide 7, we're making significant progress on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. In May, we received FERC approval to start full construction on the West Virginia portion of the pipeline. We made a similar request for North Carolina and received approval in July. Construction also continues in West Virginia and North Carolina on two of the three compressor stations and other facilities required for the project. We expect the final state permit in Virginia in the coming weeks and are targeting a fourth quarter 2019 in-service date for the project. Last week, we voluntarily requested a temporary suspension of our nationwide permit from the Army Corps of Engineers for water crossings in West Virginia. We remain committed to complying with the permit requirements and the suspension will allow the Army Corps time to thoroughly review our crossing plans. We do not expect any significant delays resulting from this review. And finally last month, we announced Piedmont Natural Gas will construct a new liquefied natural gas facility in North Carolina. This $250 million investment will help Piedmont provide a reliable gas supply to customers during peak usage periods. The facility will be located in Robeson County on property Piedmont already owns. We expect to begin construction in the summer of 2019 with an estimated completion date in the summer of 2021. Piedmont will seek recovery of the investment in a future rate case after the project is in service. As I turn the call over to Steve, our results this quarter show that the fundamentals of our business remain strong. We've continued executing on our long-term strategy, investing in infrastructure our customers value and delivering sustainable growth for our investors. As we head into the third quarter, our achievements reaffirm the confidence we have in the business and reinforce our belief that Duke Energy is the leading energy infrastructure company. Steve, let me turn it to you. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thanks, Lynn. I'll start on slide 8 with quarterly results, including our adjusted earnings per share variances to the prior year quarter. For more detailed information on segment variances versus last year, and a reconciliation of reported to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. On a reported or GAAP basis, 2018 second quarter earnings per share were $0.71 compared to $0.98 last year. Second quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share was $0.93 compared to $1.01 in the prior year. The difference between reported and adjusted earnings was primarily due to changes related to the DEC rate case order. For the quarter, lower adjusted results compared to the prior year were primarily due to a lower tax shield on holding company interest. As a result of the Tax Act, higher depreciation and higher O&M, partially offset by warmer weather and contributions from the DEP North Carolina rate case. Within the segments, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure results were down $0.03 compared to the prior year. The primary drivers were higher depreciation due to our growing asset base, higher O&M driven by storm costs, and cost related to the resolution of FERC accounting matters that impacted wholesale. Partially offsetting these drivers were favorable weather, the contribution from the DEP North Carolina rate case and increased rider revenues. The growth in rider revenues was primarily due to the recovery of our grid investments in the Midwest and the recovery of qualifying facility power purchases through the fuel rider in North Carolina as a result of House Bill 589. Shifting to Gas Utilities and Infrastructure, as expected results were flat in the quarter. We continue to expect our LDC businesses to provide the bulk of their remaining earnings contribution in the fourth quarter. In our Commercial Renewables segment, results were up $0.02 for the quarter, primarily due to a favorable settlement on a contractual agreement. Finally, Other was down $0.07 due to a lower tax yield on HoldCo interest, as a result of the Tax Act and higher interest expense at the holding company. Based on our results to-date and expectations for the second half of the year, we're tracking to the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings guidance range of $4.55 to $4.85 per share. Turning to slide 9, let me walk you through our retail volume trends. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather normalized retail electric load growth was 0.3%. Load growth remains particularly strong in our residential class, which was up 1.5% on a rolling 12-month basis. This was largely supported by continued customer growth across our service territories, and in several jurisdictions load grew faster than the number of customers in the quarter, indicating growth in usage per customers like we saw in the first quarter of this year. In the customer class, sales were flat over the rolling 12 months. We continue to see relatively flat volumes from this sector, as strength in leisure and hospitality businesses offset weakness in large retailers competing with online offerings. The industrial class saw a decline of 1.2% on a rolling 12-month basis. Similar to the first quarter, results continue to being impacted by production declines for a few large customers last year and recent outage activities. We expect the impact from these specific declines to peak this quarter and start to diminish in the second half of the year. At a macro level, economic indicators for our service areas remain strong. Population growth is solid and we are now seeing wages in non-urban areas increase for the first time in quite a while. We remain confident in our long-term assumption of 0.5% retail load growth for our electric utilities, supported by healthy economies and growth in our jurisdictions. Turning to slide 10, we have made significant progress addressing tax reform across our utilities. As Lynn mentioned, we received clarity in North Carolina with tax reform incorporated into the DEC rate case. We also reached a constructive tax reform settlement in Indiana. It defines a balanced approach that will ensure customers receive benefits with the base rate reduction in September. The settlement also maintains the utilities credit quality by staggering the return of excess deferred income taxes or EDIT and utilize some of the tax benefits to offset deferred costs. And finally, just last week we filed a request in Ohio to implement a new rider that will flow back all remaining impacts of Federal tax reform to our electric customers in that state, including the return of unprotected EDIT over 10 years. Our successful work to engage stakeholders over the past six months demonstrates our ability to reach balanced solutions and provides us with increased clarity in our largest jurisdictions as we move into the second half of the year. With constructive rulings on tax reform, along with greater clarity from the DEP and DEC rate cases, we have refreshed our credit metric projections. As you can see on slide 11, we now expect our FFO-to-debt metric to be within our target range of 15% to 16% in 2019, a year earlier than originally expected. We met with all three rating agencies to go over these updates, and as Lynn mentioned, Moody's responded just yesterday by lifting our negative outlook and affirming our current ratings at the holding company. We are now at a stable outlook with both Moody's and S&P, further highlighting the successful execution of our plan. As we outlined in February, our financing plan includes a $2 billion equity target for 2018. And to-date, we have priced nearly the entire amount. During the second quarter, we priced $200 million of equity under a forward contract through our ATM program. We also settled half of our March offering in June, drawing down $800 million. We expect to settle all outstanding equity forwards in the fourth quarter. Recall that beyond 2018, we intent to issue $350 million of equity per year through our DRIP and ATM programs, during the remainder of the five-year plan. Our improved credit metrics and Moody's move to stable are further evidence that our financing plan is sound, and we do not expect to issue additional equity over the five-year plan. I'll close with slide 12. It is clear we have the right strategy in place, investing to benefit our customers, growing the business and delivering value for investors. The foundation of our attractive investor value proposition is a growing dividend, which currently yields approximately 4.5%. Coupled with earnings growth of 4% to 6%, this provides a compelling risk-adjusted total shareholder return of 8% to 10%. We believe our combination of scale, diversity in constructive jurisdictions and growth from low-risk regulated investments is unmatched and our consistent execution and demonstrated ability to achieve results position Duke Energy as a core energy infrastructure investment. With that, let's open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Jonathan. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for reiterating your prior statements on the guidance range which we were wondering where that was in the slide deck. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: We appreciate the feedback, Jonathan. You're closely reviewing the slide deck, which is good. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. And then, could I just ask about the industrial sales? Steve, you mentioned that you've been seeing curtailments, but which segment is that in and why are you \u2013 can you just give us some more color into your confidence that there's going to be a rebound second half? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Well, I think there will be. We've seen a few customers, about three customers that have had some closings or some outages. I don't want to give any customer information that's specific. We've seen that in the Midwest and in the Carolinas. I will give that information. But we think these are singular, and we think the economic health of our service territories are good, they're good places to do business, and we're seeing economic projects landing in our footprint. And I do think that as we move forward, we'll be lapping, if you will, quarters where these outages began. So, I think we'll see some uplift in the industrial load as we move to the last half of the year because of just that fact. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Without naming names there, can you share what industrial sectors we're talking about? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: We've seen some textiles. We've seen some paper and we've seen some metals. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, the other question we had was on, you said you were going to come out with the winners in the 589 RFP shortly. Can you remind us sort of what you have in the plan for the utility in terms of renewables, owned renewables, and then maybe what's currently in for Commercial Renewables? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Jonathan, we put all of the renewables capital in one place in the five-year plan, so it's under Commercial Renewables and it's about $1.5 billion over the five-year period. The 589 RFP will close September 11, so in the third quarter or fourth quarter, we should have more clarity on that and we will be bidding into it as I know others will. We have the opportunity to win up to 30%, but also have an opportunity to buy beyond that if we think the economics work for us. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, we should think of the placeholder in Commercial as potentially being partly in the utility eventually, but it's just all there at the moment? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: That's right. That's right. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you very much. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: And I think the other point to note on that, Jonathan, is because it's in Commercial, we would expect investment beyond North Carolina in those numbers, right. So, as we continue to pursue commercial development. So everything is in there and as we get more clarity on how the RFP plays out and so on, we'll of course update those numbers. So, there could be some upside potential, but I think the $1.5 billion is a good planning assumption. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks very much. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning. This is actually Claire stepping in for Julien. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi Claire. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Claire. Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Sure. Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, my first actually has to do with the South Carolina rate case. So, I know there's been a bit of a political situation down there. Just you're thoughts on timing and your prospects on the case? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Yeah. So Claire, we're evaluating the case in South Carolina and as you know from our history, we typically have investments impacting both of our jurisdictions similarly. So, you can think about a South Carolina case perhaps later this year, towards the end of the year that would then be \u2013 go through the process in 2019. Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Anything more than a 3Q or 4Q event or just generally second half of year? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: I'm sorry, could you repeat that, we had trouble hearing you a little bit? Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Oh, no problem. Any specificity besides end of the year, maybe 3Q or 4Q or are you just saying for now end of the year? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: I would target fourth quarter for filing of a case. It won't be sooner than that. Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. That's helpful color. And turning to North Carolina here, do you have any color you can give right now on the grid mod rider strategy for the legislative session for next year and anything we should be watching in the ongoing state elections? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Claire, we have talked about our strategic priority on grid for some time and described that as being a parallel process between the regulatory and the legislative arena. We have a number of options that we're considering. And our objective is to continue to advance the dialogue. We think there are great customer benefits, economic benefits and our role will be to continue to engage with customers and stakeholders to build momentum for what we're trying to achieve. And so, I think what I would leave you with on this is our strategic priority around this has not changed and the work continues and as we have more clarity about specific tactics that we'll pursue, we'll discuss them with you at that time, but it remains front and center priority for us here in the Carolinas. Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you for that. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Maheep Mandloi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi there. Good morning. This is Maheep on behalf of Mike. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Maheep Mandloi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks for taking the questions. Just on the ACP, could you discuss any potential upside opportunity at Piedmont from the pipeline? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: The ACP is an important investment into the Carolinas to support the Piedmont system, and we have capital in the plan in connection with that expansion that is part of the ordinary course business of supporting the Piedmont system. So, I don't have anything specific that I would point to, but our hope and expectation is that with that additional mainline pipe into the Carolinas that we will see further expansion opportunities with industrials and new customers in that Eastern part of the state that will continue to drive investment. Maheep Mandloi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Sorry about that, that was on mute. Thanks for the answer. And just on grid mod rider, could you just talk about how these rate case settlements have helped you getting support for an any grid rider legislations? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: I think about the partial settlement in the DEC case as being an indication of our ability and willingness to sit down with stakeholders, to come up with collaborative approaches. I think it's particularly important as you think about policy and investment strategies and you've seen us in the Carolinas with Renewables, with HB 589 and South Carolina with solar with Senate Bill 236, you saw the partial settlement in the DEC case and I think engagement of stakeholders is an important part of progressing any strategic objective and our approach here will be to continue to advance the dialogue in the Carolinas around grid investment. We have a number of options, more frequent rate cases, regulatory arena, legislation and we will be focusing on all of those. The strategic priority of achieving an outcome remains key to us and our work continues. Maheep Mandloi - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you for answering the questions. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan. Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning, Lynn and Steve. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Appreciate the reiteration of the 4% to 6% and getting back into the range. I wanted to know given some of the positives that you've received over the past three or so months on the regulatory front and on the credit agency front. Has anything, kind of, changed underlying that 4% to 6% range for better or for worse or is the kind of makeup of how you're going to grow into 2019 and 2020 changed at all? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Chris, it hasn't changed. Our assignment here is to execute the plan that we've put in front of you and that's exactly what we're doing. And I think the track record we've demonstrated here in 2018, whether it's on rate case execution or tax reform resolution or the balance sheet and credit metrics, we've executed across all of those things and that process will continue. And so, we look into 2019 with investments and rate activity, Atlantic Coast Pipeline. We have a number of things that are in front of us and I would summarize our job is to execute and that's where our focus is. Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then, my second question is on cost cuts, kind of, underlying the plan. Clearly, you're planning on filing in the Carolinas to support the growth and you have riders in most other jurisdictions, but how important is cost cuts to, kind of, any lag catch-up or preventing any lag from opening up during that time period? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Chris, keeping a focus on productivity and cost while maintaining a focus on operational excellence and serving customers is our job every day. And as we look at what's in our plan, we're planning for O&M to be flat over the period, and have demonstrated our agility around O&M over the last several years, as we have responded to impacts in our business, and we feel like we have a good track record of doing that, and we will exercise that agility if need be. And as I said a moment ago, that's part of execution in my mind. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yeah, so I would add that controlling O&M costs is essential every day, and it gives us headroom to make more capital investment for our customers that are beneficial at lower rates. So, we work at that every day. Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And we should think about that flat over the time period as flat in every individual year or is that just an average? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: I would think about it every year. Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, excellent. Thanks guys. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Praful Mehta from Citi. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Hi, guys. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Morning. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Hello. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Morning. So, on the FFO, congrats on the improvement, or at least the earlier kind of hitting your target. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Just wanted to understand, what does that mean from a capital allocation perspective? Is that creating headroom for something you could do incremental in terms of CapEx or on the Commercial Renewables side? Just wanted to understand, what's the implication of that for the story? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: I think capital allocation is something, Praful, we look at every year in connection with our five-year plan. And we do have some opportunities coming up with HB 589, the Commercial business always remains. But our commitment to that balance sheet strength is also critical and maintaining within those targets is the way we manage the plan, and so we'll provide an update on capital allocation and optimization when we come to you in February with guidance. But I wouldn't share anything more specific than that at this point. Steve, any further thoughts? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: I agree. We'll look at our capital plan. We have an extensive capital optimization process where we look across jurisdictions and functions and try to find the optimal placing of capital. And we'll continue that process but we'll have further updates later. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you, thanks guys. And then just stepping back I think like you said Lynn, you've had a very good trajectory in 2018 with some good rate case outcomes or regulatory outcomes. Clearly your credit pressure is now behind you or mostly behind you. How are you now looking forward strategically? I get the execution is still the focus which clearly is great, but strategically is there anything else in your radar that you are thinking about that needs to be done either M&A-wise or anything else from a portfolio management perspective? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Nothing specific on portfolio management, Praful, but demonstrating organic growth is \u2013 I'd just like to emphasize that as part of execution, so this is getting this grid investment to work, it's delivering the benefits to customers, delivering returns, continuing to grow the dividend. That I would put at the top of the list of strategic priorities for the company. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: All right. Great. Thanks guys. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrew Weisel from Scotia Howard Weil. Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil : Hey good morning everyone. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil : Before I get to my question, I just want to clarify if I heard you right. For grid modernization, are you suggesting that the rider would have helped, but it's not the only way and would you move forward with accelerating some of those initiatives without a potential legislative fix? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: So, the grid rider is not the only way, Andrew, I would say, and we will always pace our investment in a way that makes sense for the recovery strategy. That's part of capital optimization that Steve talked about a moment ago. And so, our work continues here to pursue appropriate next steps. We'll keep the dialogue going, bringing stakeholders together on the way forward. But we'll look at capital relative to the tactical plan around recovery and make the appropriate adjustments that we need to make. Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil : Okay, good. That's helpful. Then a two-part question on Renewables. First under HB 589, you mentioned there's that 30% cap that you could acquire beyond that cap. When might deals like that potentially be announced? Would it be at the time of the RFP decision, during construction or maybe after it begins operations? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: I believe they would be after bids have been selected and winners of bids have been selected that some of those types of transactions might subsequently occur. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: When I think about September 11, RFP closes, there'll be some reviewed analysis. I would assume following that, winners would be announced subsequently. Then, we have an opportunity to perhaps purchase some. We'll see where we performed in the RFP. So, this will play out over the next couple of quarters, it's the way I would think about it Andrew. Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil : Great. That's helpful. Then lastly, if I understand correctly, Shoreham was your first tax equity financing. How would you describe your appetite for more tax equity deals going forward? And how would you describe the market for it? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: We do have an appetite for using tax equity in our deals. Shoreham was the first that we've executed on. And there is a market out there for tax equity. There is the tax appetite there and that's useful to us in our Commercial Renewables business. So we'll continue in that direction. Andrew Weisel - Scotia Howard Weil : Very good. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ms. Lynn Good, at this time I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Well thank you everyone for your questions and your interest and investment in Duke Energy. We look forward to speaking with many of you over the days and weeks to come and look forward to a successful third and fourth quarter. Thank you. Operator : And that concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Operator : Good day and welcome to the Duke Energy Third Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Callahan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Callahan - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you, Cody. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining Duke Energy's third quarter 2018 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the Safe Harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today's materials. Please note the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. As summarized on slide 3, during today's call, Lynn will provide an update on recent activities, including our response to Hurricanes Florence and Michael. She will also discuss progress on our strategic initiatives. Steve will then provide an overview of our third quarter financial results and insight about economic and load growth trends. He will also discuss our growth drivers for 2019 before closing with key investor considerations. With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on slide 4. Today, we announced strong results for the quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.65 compared to $1.59 in the prior year. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities, supported by the outstanding work of our employees, who restored outages and back-to-back hurricanes over the last two months. As we look to the end of the year, we have narrowed our full year guidance to $4.65 to $4.85 per share, raising the midpoint and to the upper half of our original range. We also reaffirmed our long-term earnings growth rate of 4% to 6% through 2022, also midpoint of our 2017 guidance range. We continue to expect earnings growth at the low end of this range in 2019 and the mid to high end of the range in 2020 and beyond. In addition to strong financial results, we're pleased to highlight several recent recognitions for the company. Let me emphasize too that I know are important to our ESG investors. Duke Energy was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 13th consecutive year, demonstrating our commitment to sustainability and corporate responsibility. And Forbes named Duke Energy to their Global Best Employers list, which is based on rankings of publicly traded companies from 60 countries around the world. We're proud that our company and employees are being recognized for the work we do every day on behalf of our customers and communities. Turning to slide 5, I want to give you an update on our response to hurricanes Florence and Michael and in a moment Steve will share our thoughts on cost estimates and recovery. First, Hurricane Florence, this was a massive slow-moving storm that made landfall on the North Carolina coast in early September, causing widespread devastation and record setting rainfall. Ahead of the storm, we assembled our largest restoration force ever in the Carolinas, over 20,000 workers, to prepare and immediately begin restoring power when it was safe to do so. In addition, 2,000 employees outside of transmission and distribution volunteered to support our efforts from managing logistics to providing extra help, answering customer calls. We restored over 1.8 million outages in less than 10 days, with 93% restored in five days. Despite extensive flooding, the environment around our facilities, including ash basins remained well protected. This is a testament to our team's extensive preparation in advance of the storm and on the ground management throughout the heavy rainfall. Only weeks later, Hurricane Michael made landfall in early October on the Florida Panhandle. Michael triggered over 70,000 power outages in our Florida service territory before moving north and causing over 1.1 million outages in the Carolinas. More than 15,000 workers contributed to the restoration efforts with 90% of the outages restored within three days. All customers who could receive power were restored in five days in the Carolinas and eight days in Florida, but work continues in Florida as we rebuild our infrastructure in the most devastated areas. Our successful storm response was driven in part by lessons learned from previous storms and our investments to improve the grid. For example, in our DEP service territory, self-healing grid technologies rerouted power from damaged lines to minimize outages. We estimate that we avoided 27 million outage minutes across the Carolinas from the use of this technology during Hurricane Florence. Our grid improvement plan includes expansion of this technology to 80% of our customers over the next decade, up from 16% currently. And in Florida, we made improvements on a transmission line at St. George Island a few years ago. This area was in the direct path of the hurricane and the structures withstood hurricane force winds. During this hurricane season, we restored 3 million outages, thanks to the tireless work of our employees and utility partners. And I'm truly proud of this team. The benefits of modernizing and hardening the grid were clear during the hurricanes and we continue to invest in the energy grid on behalf of our customers. We've highlighted several developments across our jurisdictions on slide 6. In South Carolina, the Commission approved deferral accounting treatment for our grid improvement investments such as smart meters, self-optimizing grid technology and additional hardening and resiliency mechanisms. Our grid improvement plan is a key part of our strategy to meet customer expectations. These investments will deliver increased reliability, enable distributed resources and provide enhanced customer convenience and control. In the Carolinas, we recently announced approximately $500 million in battery storage investments over the next 15 years, as described in our Integrated Resource Plan filed this past September. This investment, equal to about 300 megawatts of capacity, will provide our Carolinas utilities with another tool to balance the energy system. In Florida, consistent with our multiyear agreement, we announced an electric vehicle pilot program that will install up to 530 EV charging stations throughout our service territory in 2019. These stations will be connected in multi-unit dwellings, workplaces and other areas with broad public access. Similarly, we have proposed an electric transportation pilot in South Carolina, which includes charging station programs throughout residential areas as well as school and transit bus systems. We look forward to rolling out similar programs in our other jurisdictions to promote greater use of electric vehicles for our customers. Moving to slide 7, let me provide an update on some of our other strategic investments. We are nearing completion of our 1,600-megawatt Citrus County natural gas combined-cycle plant in Florida. The first unit came online in October. We have successfully achieved initial firing of Unit 2, which is on track to start serving customers in December. Recall that the Florida Commission approved our requested $200 million revenue increase for the plant under the GBRA mechanism. Increases to customer rates for Unit 1 will begin in December and rates associated with Unit 2 are expected to be implemented in January. Construction continues at our natural gas combined-cycle plant in Asheville as part of our Western Carolinas modernization project. The plant is 50% complete and remains on track for the expected late 2019 in-service date. In July, we launched the first request for proposal for new renewable energy resources in North Carolina under House Bill 589. This 680-megawatt solicitation seeks projects that can be placed in service by the end of 2020. Bids were submitted October 9, including those from our North Carolina utilities and Commercial Renewables business. Over the next several months, the independent administrator will review the bids and winning proposals are expected to be notified in the first quarter of 2019. New project construction is anticipated to begin in the second half of 2019 to meet the 2020 in-service dates. In Commercial Renewables, we've started a process to find a minority partner in our existing 3,000-megawatt wind and solar portfolio as we seek to recycle and reinvest capital from these assets. We will continue to be the majority owner and operator of the portfolio and intend to retain nearly all of the tax benefits associated with the projects. It is still early in the process, but we are seeing strong interest. Looking ahead to 2019, we have approximately 300 megawatts of wind and solar in late stages of development. And we will use tax equity to finance these projects. Turning to our gas business on slide 8, let me provide an update on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. We're working diligently to complete the project to bring low-cost gas supply and economic development opportunities to the region. Mainline construction continues in West Virginia and North Carolina. And we're making progress on constructing the compressor and metering and regulation stations in those states. The tree-felling window reopened in September and we continue with felling activities where permitted in all three states along the pipeline route. The Virginia DEQ approved our erosion and sediment control plan on October 19, making the water quality certificate effective for that state. We've requested permission from FERC to begin full construction activities in Virginia and expect the approvals soon. This was the last major permit remaining for the pipeline, marking a significant milestone for the project. Throughout this process, the relevant permitting agencies have conducted extensive due diligence, ensuring the project will meet all necessary environmental rules and regulations. We appreciate the professionalism exhibited by these agencies as they worked with our project team to complete these reviews. Given permitting delays and the FERC's stop work order in August, the project partners have reexamined the construction schedule and cost estimates. We will now pursue with our customers putting the pipeline in service in phases with the late 2019 in-service for all station facilities and key portions of the pipeline in order to meet peak winter demand. We're also pursuing a mid-2020 in-service date for the remaining segments. Based on these changes, we now estimate cost in the range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion, an increase of $500 million over the previous range. Future factors such as abnormal weather, work delays due to judicial or regulatory action and other circumstances may result in additional costs or schedule changes. In summary, our year-to-date results show that our company is performing well. We will continue executing on our strategy, investing in infrastructure our customers value and delivering sustainable growth for our investors. As we look to close out the year, our achievements once again reinforce our belief that Duke Energy is the leading energy infrastructure company. And before I turn it over to Steve, I want to thank our employees once again for their remarkable work during Hurricanes Florence and Michael. They showed unwavering dedication to our customers. Steve, let me turn it to you. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thanks, Lynn. I'll start with quarterly results on slide 9, including our adjusted earnings per share variances for the prior year. For more detailed information on variance drivers and a reconciliation of reported to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. On a reported or GAAP basis, 2018 third quarter earnings per share were $1.51 compared to $1.36 last year. Third quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share was $1.65 compared to $1.59 in the prior year. The difference between reported and adjusted earnings was primarily due to a charge resulting from annual goodwill testing in our Commercial Renewables business. For the quarter, higher adjusted results compared to the prior year were primarily due to higher retail electric sales volumes and income tax benefits, partially offset by higher storm restoration costs and share dilution. Within the segment, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure was up $0.10 compared to the prior year. Results were supported by a few factors including strong load growth and more favorable weather. We also saw growth from higher rider revenues and contributions from the DEP and DEC North Carolina rate cases. Finally, the Electric segment benefited from lower income tax expense, including impacts of the Tax Act. These favorable drivers were partially offset by three items : higher depreciation and amortization expense from a growing rate base, a charge related to the Edwardsport settlement in Indiana, and higher O&M, largely due to Hurricane Florence restoration costs. We estimate total O&M the cost for Hurricane Florence of approximately $450 million, with the majority of the cost at our DEP utility. We will request permission to defer approximately $370 million of incremental cost for recovery in the next DEP rate case. The remaining incremental cost impacted O&M expense in the quarter and exceeded the cost from Hurricane Irma in 2017, contributing to the year-over-year variance. I'd also point out that our preliminary O&M cost estimate for Hurricane Michael is approximately $200 million. The cost from this storm which primarily impacted our DEC and DEF utilities will be recorded in the fourth quarter. As with Florence, we will also request to defer the majority of these costs for future recovery. We will be making the appropriate filings with the state commissions over the coming months. Shifting to Gas Utilities and Infrastructure, results were flat in the quarter. Growth from our midstream investments was offset by higher O&M. We expect our LDC businesses to provide the bulk of their remaining earnings contribution in the fourth quarter. In our Commercial Renewables segment, results were up $0.03 for the quarter. The increase was primarily due to the Shoreham Solar project, which was placed in service in July. Finally, Other was down $0.04 for the quarter, largely due to a lower tax yield as a result of the Federal Tax Act and a favorable litigation settlement in the prior year. Higher tax optimization benefits partially offset these drivers. We continue to expect our full year 2018 adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 16%. As you know, we settled half of our March equity offering in June, which resulted in $0.03 of share dilution for the quarter. Our equity financing plan remains on track and we continue to expect to settle all outstanding equity forwards in the fourth quarter. Our strong execution through the first three quarters gives us confidence in our full year projection. And as Lynn mentioned, we narrowed our 2018 guidance range to $4.65 to $4.85 per share, raising the midpoint into the upper half of our original guidance range for the year. This reflects our results to date, including favorable weather, partially offset by costs associated with the two hurricanes. We're well positioned for the remainder of the year and we'll manage our O&M and other business drivers in a way that keeps us on track to deliver on our commitments. Turning to slide 10, our retail volumes were very strong in the quarter. Let me take a moment to walk you through the trends we're seeing across our serviced areas. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather-normalized retail electric load growth was 1%. Our residential class continues to drive the growth with an overall increase of 1.8% on a rolling 12-month basis. Strong customer growth continues across our service territories and was amplified this quarter by positive usage per customer in certain jurisdictions. We will continue to monitor this trend, given we've seen this periodically over the course of the year. We also saw strength in the commercial class, with sales up 1.1% over the rolling 12 months. Ongoing data center expansion and strength in hospitality and leisure segments helped to offset weakness in retail stores driven by competition from online shopping. Finally, sales in our industrial class continued to improve and we were pleased to see a 1.8% increase within this sector during the quarter, driven by robust manufacturing growth in several sectors such as metals, textiles and transportation. The Carolinas, in particular, saw strong industrial growth in the quarter. These retail volume trends, along with a healthy economy and growth in our jurisdictions, further support our long-term planning assumption of 0.5% retail load growth for our Electric Utilities. As we head into the close of the year, let me highlight on slide 11 some of the drivers for 2019. We expect to be back within our long-term earnings growth range in 2019, which represents 6% growth off of our original 2018 midpoint. I'll start with growth in the Electric Utilities segment. In the Carolinas, earnings will be supported by a full year's contribution from this year's North Carolina rate cases, upcoming rate activity in South Carolina, as well AFUDC on our Western Carolina's modernization project. In Florida, as Lynn discussed, we are adding the Citrus County combined-cycle plant to customer rates in the next few months. We will also begin to recover our ongoing grid investments through the first rate increase under our multiyear rate plan. Finally, we expect to initiate rate recovery under the solar base rate adjustment mechanism once our first solar project is in operation this December. In the Midwest, we will continue to invest in transmission and distribution upgrades that are recovered under our rider programs in Indiana and Ohio. In the Gas segment, earnings will grow based on the continued construction on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, coupled with continued integrity management investments and strong customer additions in our gas LDCs. The changes to the ACP schedule and cost estimate that Lynn described will not significantly impact earnings in 2019 and 2020 as the project will continue to accrue AFUDC and now on a higher cost base. Additionally, we have a strong pipeline of projects in our Commercial Renewables business, including the late-stage wind and solar projects with 2019 in-service dates. Finally, we expect further load growth consistent with our long-term planning assumption. And we are aggressively managing cost across our businesses, including using digital capabilities to drive efficiencies. As you can see, we have a substantial set of investment opportunities that will provide growth into next year and beyond as we continue to execute on our strategy. I'll close with slide 12. Our attractive investor value proposition is founded upon our growing dividend, which currently yields approximately 4.5%. Coupled with earnings growth of 4% to 6% from transparent low-risk investments, this provides a compelling risk adjusted total shareholder return of 8% to 10%. Duke Energy's scale, constructive service areas and ability to execute position the company as the leading energy infrastructure investment. With that, let's open the lines for your questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good morning. This is actually Claire for Julien here. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Claire. How are you? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Doing well. Thanks for taking my question. My first is just on ACP. What is your expectation on timing to fund that additional CapEx need and how will it be funded? And what are you anticipating the returns on ACP now are? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: So, Claire, I'll take returns first. We expect this return to be consistent with other regulated investments. And so we're comfortable with where we are on return. And I would think about the financing of ACP as being managed through the overall financing of the company and then we do intend to put project financing in place at the time the project goes in service. Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. It doesn't really have much of a bearing on your FFO to debt metrics. Just confirming that. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: We're committed to our FFO to debt metrics, Claire. And I think we've shared these ranges with you in previous calls. The cost increase for ACP, our responsibility is about half of that amount. And we believe we have tools within our company to manage through that transition. Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. That's helpful. And just turning over to renewables as well, at this point, what do you think \u2013 what would you estimate the market out there to be potential or expected proceeds? And how would your use of proceeds work? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Claire, we're very early in the process. What I will share is that there has been strong interest. We've been watching this market for some time and are very familiar with it. The use of proceeds, I think we're too early to talk specifically about that. We haven't earmarked proceeds for any specific purpose. And of course, we'll update you as the sale process continues and give you a closer look at a financing plan as we come to the Street in February. Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Would it be fair to just view it as offsetting incremental debt issuances or any kind of other funding internally? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: I wouldn't be that specific at this point, Claire. We've just launched the process. So we need to work through it in order to have a sense of where the market is, the proceeds, the timing and all of those things. So that's where we are at this point. Claire Zeng - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Jonathan. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Just one quick thing. It looks like \u2013 or if I look at trailing 12-month numbers, the midpoint of the new 2018 range would suggest a slightly down fourth quarter. Can you remind us what type of things would support that? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: I think as we go into the fourth quarter, you're looking at milder weather and that impact there will pick up the gas distribution business. I don't think there's anything unusual that we're looking at in the fourth quarter. Some of the variations per quarter are hard to predict. Tax optimization efforts, as an example, that came through in the third quarter. In certain years, they have come through in a fourth quarter. So, I wouldn't look to anything negative that's occurring necessarily in the fourth quarter, Jonathan. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: The only special thing I'd point to, Jonathan, is Michael is in the fourth quarter. The storm hit in October. So we'll be addressing Michael in the fourth quarter. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just on industrial growth, you flagged last quarter that you expected some of the temporary effects to start working out of the numbers and looks like that happened. But what do you feel is your underlying industrial sales growth number? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: I think the underlying industrial sales growth number will continue to improve as we move out and lap, if you will, some of the unique perturbations there. We saw very strong industrial growth for this particular quarter, as I mentioned, across the entire enterprise of 1.8%. I don't know that we're going to see that as an ongoing mechanism \u2013 ongoing number going forward. But we do see strength in our residential customers, a good bit of diversity across the enterprise. I don't have a full year number. I think the overall 0.5% is very solid, but that combines residential with it and commercial as well. So, no specific number yet on what I'd see industrial on a run rate, but it's improving on the 12-month carrying. And I think that'll continue for a few quarters. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. My question really, Steve, was, is the growth \u2013 the improvement, just the lapping of the outages, or is it actually underlying growth as well? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: I think we're seeing some underlying growth as well with it. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, can you just remind us what is the sales growth assumption overall that underpins your comments on guidance and getting to the high end of 4% to 6% in 2020 plus? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Again, we're looking at 0.5% sales growth weather normal across our footprint and that's all customer classes. We continue to think that's a reasonable number to bake into our forecasting over our longer term plans. Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you, guys. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you, Jonathan. Operator : Thank you. We'll now move on to Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Michael. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Hello. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So, just to follow up on Jon's question. It looks like sales growth is actually continuing to improve and we've seen that for several quarters now and you're thinking that it might continue going forward. At what point do you think you might start considering increasing the projected growth that's embedded in guidance from 0.5% to something a little higher? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Michael, I think we'll continue to watch. We've been surprised to the upside, which is a good thing, but we believe a 0.5% assumption is good to really establish the parameters around our cost structure and the way we manage the business. For every positive piece of economic news, there's something on the horizon, whether it's tariffs or rising interest rates and other things. So, we're really comfortable with 0.5% now and hope to surprise to the upside. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got you. And for hurricane costs, for Hurricane Michael and also Hurricane Florence, is there anything that's been going on? Those are being deferred right now. I mean, do you have a deferral order? Just remind me, sorry if I missed that earlier. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: We will make application for the official deferral order in the near-term. We are \u2013 in the third quarter, we incurred the costs associated with Hurricane Florence. And as I said, we've deferred $370 million of the O&M costs related to that and the deferrals based upon past history and practice. We'll make those official filings later this year. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: As you get ready for next year's rate cases in North Carolina and also for \u2013 talking to the state legislators about grid modernization, do you think that the \u2013 it seems to me like an increasing frequency of hurricanes in your territory and throughout the Southeast. Is that being factored into the discussions or has that improved the climate for grid modernization going forward? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Michael, I would say those storms have been a significant issue here in the Carolina. It's just the impact on the eastern part of the state. And there is a lot of interest to invest in infrastructure to support that region and to make smart investments to position the state for the future. So, I think hardening and resiliency is something that makes a lot of sense. And we're, of course, developing projects that we believe would support the infrastructure in the state. Taking lessons learned from these storms, but also looking at other areas of our grid that we think modernization could benefit customers. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: All right. Thanks a lot, Lynn. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Greg. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Morning. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Going back to the line of questioning from earlier, you're doing well this year, the midpoint of guidance is $4.75. And then, using a $4.60 base, and I'm looking at slide 11, are you saying you expect the compound annual growth rate to be 4% through 2019? And then, the compound annual growth rate, not the incremental growth rate, but the compound annual growth rate to look more like 5% or 5.5% as you get into 2022. I just want to make sure that I'm looking at that correctly. You're using a compounding function not a year-over-year function, correct? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: That's right. And so, Greg, what we're talking about is 4% compound number for 2019. And then by 2020, we believe we'll be up in that 5%, mid to high end of the range. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Right. And that's my point. That's my point. Because 5% compound from $4.60 in 2017 through 2020 would put you $0.10 above Street consensus, $5.33 a share, and would put you $0.15 above Street consensus in 2021. And the Street has been consistently, me included, to be frank with you, more cynical about your growth opportunities as it pertains to your guidance. And so what gives you the confidence that the compounding effect of the investments and the changes you're making in the business can get you there? And what do you think the dissidence is between Street expectations and your aspirations? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: So, Greg, I would say that the capital plan that we've put in front of the Street as well as the recovery mechanisms that go with that give us the confidence to deliver the results. And of course, cost management, load growth are also a part of that picture. And we believe we've been consistently demonstrating the ability to grow the company. This is the second full year of the portfolio that we now operate. Historically, we had some noise with international and other things. They're now two years in the rearview mirror. And my expectation is as we continue to execute, there will be greater confidence that we will deliver what we've set out. And so we're proud of the fact that we're delivering what we set out in terms of commitments this year. We delivered last year. We have adjusted with tax reform in a way that has been constructive not only to investors but to the balance sheet. And so, our assignment is to keep executing in a way that grows the company and maintains that balance sheet for the future and that is our focus. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. And how necessary or important to the execution of your plan is, the grid modernization and capital plan rollout in North Carolina and getting recovery mechanisms either through legislative guidance to the Commission or from the Commission that are a more contemporaneous return framework? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Well, grid investment is an important part of the strategy, Greg. And certainly, North Carolina is important to the overall results of Duke Energy because of the scale of those utilities, both DEC and DEP. As we've shared with you, we believe we have parallel paths to pursue, a legislative path or increased frequency of regulatory filings in order to achieve our financial results. We do believe, with the value proposition that grid investment represents, including the storm hardening that we just talked, that a recovery mechanism that is certain over a two to three year period with predictable investment and predictable impact to customers with value that goes with those predictable increases is a compelling business proposition and we'll continue to pursue, as I said, in both the legislative and regulatory process. Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC : Lynn, thank you. Take care. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Morning, Stephen. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Stephen. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Wanted to go back to the ACP process. Given that the cost has gone up, I wondered if you could just talk through the regulatory process for potentially adjusting the required revenue upward or should we assume that it's relatively unlikely that revenue would be adjusted upward? I just wanted to circle back on that. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Stephen, I think we are in discussions with customers in connection with this partial in-service trying to establish interim pricing. And our objective always is to find the right balance between meeting customer needs and delivering benefits and then returns to investors. We have reset price once and received approval of those prices. We believe this investment still represents the most cost-effective solution for our customers and we'll continue to be in dialogue with customers as we go forward. So, our focus right now is on partial in-service and establishing interim prices and we'll just continue to stay in touch with customers as the project continues. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. And then just further on system hardening, I think you've given us some good color as to how you're thinking about that, but I'm trying to get a better sense for the path to getting approval. So let's just say that you go through your assessment and you determine that an additional amount of capital is needed. Could you talk a little bit more to the different paths that we should be thinking about in terms of getting approval for that spending? Just it seems like obviously there probably are needs for significant additional hardening. How do we think about translating that into regulatory or legislative outcomes? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Stephen, I think it depends on the path that we take. I think in a legislative path, a stakeholder process will be important to have discussions around the type of investment, the timing, et cetera. You may recall, we reached a partial settlement with certain environmental stakeholders as part of the DEC case that set a term, a cap, pilots for targeted under grounding and then specific investments around batteries, EV, et cetera, self-optimizing technologies, et cetera. So, I think as you think about a multi-year rate plan or if you were to think about some other method to establish a multiyear investment program, there would be some degree of sharing those investments and agreement. We don't contemplate that it would necessarily be required pre-approval on individual projects because we're talking about a number of small things that accumulate over time, but we, of course, are early in the process of making those changes. Under a pure regulatory path, you make the investments and demonstrate benefits and those become a part of your cost of service and you would think about those in a traditional way. Let me just close by saying, we are in discussion around these investments and the benefits they can deliver to customers, both with regulators and with stakeholders. And that process will continue. We think those investments are very important to the state and to our customer base. And so, those conversations will continue. Stephen Calder Byrd - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very good. Thank you very much. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Good morning. Just... Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Steve. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, Lynn. So, just a question first on the quarter. I think in a couple of the business, as you mentioned, the impact of tax rate partially due to the tax law change. Could you maybe separate out tax law change versus other tax items just so we have an idea on that? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: What I might mention here on tax law changes is we had some fixed price contracts in our wholesale business, gas and electric, whereby the pricing doesn't change necessarily due to tax changes. So that brings some benefits in. And then, there's just tax optimization we're working through the various structures that we have in place across our footprint that'll provide some benefits. I don't have a breakout right now between those, but those are the two factors that lead to it. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. That's fine. And then, I guess, just on the renewable for North Carolina. My recollection is those were not necessarily in your capital plan if you end up winning some of those, but I'm not sure if anything else has kind of changed in the plan going back to really this year. So just if we see you win a handful of projects there, should we think about that all being incremental or in the context of kind of the whole plan maybe some things haven't gone away? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: I would think about it more within the context of the plan, Steve. We did have renewable capital in our plan in February. And actually, the way we approached it is we put all of the capital in the Commercial business, recognizing that it could either be in the utility or the commercial business depending on how we win, but we put the capital in the Commercial Renewables segment. So, given the timeline of House Bill 589 and the fact we'll know more after the first of the year, we'll continue to update capital and share that with you in February. But I would think about it at this point as part of the overall capital plan that we shared with you. Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Praful Mehta with Citi. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. Hi, guys. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Hello. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. So, maybe first touch on the storms. I know you're deferring some of the costs, but in terms of the cash flow, is there an ability to fund some of that cash with securitization? Or if there isn't, how do you fund or does it put any kind of pressure on the credit metrics or different funding gap, given the storm costs that you're facing right now? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Praful, we are financing in the short-term with commercial paper, short-term financing methods, and we will convert to longer term at the right time. We'll be filing, as Steve indicated, for a deferral at the end of the year and would like to match long-term financing with the recovery mechanisms that are in place. We're always mindful of the impact to customers. And so, we have tools like excess deferred taxes that have not yet been fully dealt with in the Carolinas. Securitization, as you mentioned, is always a tool. So, our plans will continue to mature on this over the balance of this year into next. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. And does Commercial Renewables and the sale of Commercial Renewables, will that fit neatly into it or does it happen to fit neatly into it or is there a plan to kind of use some of those proceeds for this? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: We haven't earmarked proceeds from Commercial Renewables at this point, Praful. Early in the process, don't yet know what the value is going to be, timing, etcetera, but you can think about that as a tool, right, within the company at large, of an inflow of cash. So, we'll consider all of these things and really be in a position to give more feedback on specific financing plans in February. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got you. That's helpful. And then, finally, just following up a little bit on Greg's question on long-term growth. Wanted to understand, you had mentioned earlier the impact of tariffs and other macro factors that could impact your growth as you think about it longer term. I guess to achieve your long-term target, what are the variables we should be thinking about or tracking on a more macro level that you think could impact your ability to execute on the 4% to 6%? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Praful, those comments were within the context of why not raise 0.5%. So, we believe 0.5% is a very good planning assumption as we look at the profile of our business, where we're located geographically, the attractive nature of the service territories, et cetera. But large economic shocks, if we were to ever get to that point, would be something we'd need to check and adjust, but there's nothing unique to Duke Energy, as I talk about that. So, as I think about long-term growth, 0.5% is load growth assumption. Aggressive cost management will continue to be a part of the equation. And then, the capital plan that we've put in front of you with rate increases or recovery mechanisms that are in place across our jurisdiction will be the other driver. Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Awesome. Very helpful. Thank you, Lynn. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Shar. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Hello, Shar. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. You touched on most of my questions, but let me just \u2013 can you just elaborate on House Bill 589 real quick and sort of what's embedded in your plan, because I thought prior communication really focused on having a very little \u2013 somewhat of a base assumption around what you could win? And I guess the way I'm trying to come up with this is there's 2.7 gigawatts potentially in this state that can be procured. There's 30% that you guys could essentially win, but there's no cap on how much you guys can acquire from developers that are likely looking to recycle their capital, right? So, if you kind of look at the opportunity set, it could reach well over $1 billion to $2 billion of opportunity. So, I guess my question is, how much of this is embedded in your plan? Is it sort of a very little base assumption? I'm just trying to figure out the scale here because I thought this was predominately incremental. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Shar, I appreciate that question. We did put an assumption in, but I think to use your terminology, it's going to be closer to a base assumption than it is to a we-buy-everything assumption. And as I have said a moment ago, we're beginning to \u2013 we're early in the process. The bids are in. The administrator will be reviewing bids. We'll begin to have some visibility to this process in the first quarter and that would be the time for us to update. We see the nature of the projects, we see the returns that are implied, and I think they represent great opportunities for us, but we'd be evaluating those returns against the other investment opportunities we have and making good decisions about it. So, to close, I would say that the capital that's in there is more of a base assumption. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it. And then just let me ask you, assuming that the ultimate outcome is better than your base assumption, do you see any need to put incremental equity as far as looking at additional opportunities around solar. So, i.e., if you do better than your base assumption, you acquire developers that are looking to recycle, is there any instance where you think you may need to raise equity as a result? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Shar, at this point, we're comfortable with the plans we've put in front of you on equity, the equity raise we did this year. Our ongoing assumptions around about $350 million of equity a year, we think that positions the company really well, strikes the right balance between balance sheet and growth. And so, I would think about that incremental capital as being evaluated as part of our total investment plan. And we'll continue, as I said, to provide updates on what we think the future holds. But right now, I'm comfortable with the equity plan we have in place and our ability to absorb upside on the renewables as we look at the total collection of capital that we're planning to spend as a company. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: And I'd add that the use of tax equity financing and back leverage and so forth helps on minimizing the investment on Commercial Renewables. Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it. Thanks, Steven, and see you soon. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our question from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Morning. First question, I wanted to just clarify the raise in the 2018 midpoint of $0.05, is that all primarily driven by better weather or was there something else in there? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Ali, I would say weather and volumes on the upside, really being offset by storm expense is the way I would look at it. So, we've had very strong weather in volumes, but we've also had the hurricanes to absorb. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I got you. Okay. And then secondly, next year when you all update your plans, et cetera, is there thought would you move your base year to 2018 to build out your growth rate targets, or what are you thinking about there? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Ali, we haven't made a decision around base year. We've been working off of 2017. As you know, we've continued to emphasize that, as outlined on slide 11. So, we'll make that evaluation as we go forward, but you should be comfortable that we're talking about a range that works off of the 2017 base. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. And then also, in terms of the longer term growth outlook, just remind us again sort of embedded in your long term, 4% to 6% CAGR, how much reduction, if any, in regulatory lag is assumed in there, or is it all sort of CapEx rate based driven with earned ROEs relatively constant. Can you just remind us what the earned ROE trends? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: A couple of things I'd point at. We've got a long history of earning well on our regulated rate basis, in the 10%, 10.5% range. Through periods of having rate cases, not having rate cases, we've been able to utilize cost efficiencies, expansion of wholesale sales to \u2013 and rate cases to make that happen through various differing circumstances. There certainly is an element of lag as you build your investment base between rate cases. That's natural to occur. It'll vary depending up on the regulatory mechanisms in place and the timeframes between rate cases. But we're working to reconstruct the regulatory recovery mechanisms and minimize lag as much as possible. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. Steve, just to be clear, that ramp-up \u2013 the implied ramp-up in growth from 2020 onwards, that's all being driven by the \u2013 the way you're looking at your CapEx profile, you're not assuming a pickup in earned ROE helping you 2020 and beyond? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Well, it's looking at the investment base growing and our ability to convert that into revenues through the regulatory processes, in addition to organic load growth and renewables business, all of that combined. But on the regulated side, it's the investments and the ability to efficiently incorporate that into revenues at typical allowed types of returns, as we have demonstrated at our ability to do for many years. Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Understood. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our final question today comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, Lynn. I have an easy one. You filed in South Carolina, can you talk to us a little bit about just your main request in South Carolina and whether you're actually trying to seek any kind of more structural change in rate making there or is it just kind of a traditional rate case? And then, B, how should we think about where you're likely \u2013 the cadence of rate case filings between now and maybe the end of 2019 in terms of where you're likely to file? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Michael, I would think about the South Carolina cases as mirroring, in many ways, what we tried to accomplish in North Carolina. So, the same drivers and approach, trying to focus on grid investment, but also receiving recovery of historic investments, it'll be the same approach in South Carolina. We did point out on this call that we were successful in achieving a deferral of the grid investment, which we view as a positive step in South Carolina. And then in terms of other rate cases, Florida will automatically reset with the Citrus, the solar and the grid investment. Midwest also will continue to reset, but you can expect us to file cases next year. Piedmont potentially, Indiana potentially, and then with the in service date of Western Carolinas, that's a good date to watch for the Duke Energy progress case. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you. And I guess last one, how do you think about the cadence of O&M in 2018 relative to what you originally expected? And I'm trying to think about it excluding storm impact. And then, the opportunity set for being able to manage it down further in 2019. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: In 2018, we're tracking to be right at our target for O&M, exclusive of the storm costs. And again, our broad target for O&M is to keep it flat throughout our planning horizon. And I think we have the capabilities to do that, hopefully do better than that, as we advance capabilities and data analytics and rolling out digital technology capabilities across our footprint with our scope and scale, I think we have great abilities to control O&M. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Lynn. See you... Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: ...out in California. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: All right. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today's question and answer session. Now, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Lynn Good for additional and closing remarks. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Great. Thank you. And thank you again for your interest and investment in Duke Energy. We look forward to seeing many of you in the upcoming EEI Conference next week. So thanks again. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you, all, for your participation.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Callahan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Michael Callahan : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining Duke Energy\u2019s fourth quarter 2018 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the safe harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today\u2019s materials. Please note the appendix for today\u2019s presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Mike, thank you and good morning everyone. Before we share detail on our results, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge that this is our first earnings call since the passing of Jim Rogers. Jim was a transformational leader who served with a boundless passion and helped shape the future of our Company and the energy industry. He will be deeply missed. Now, as Jim would have wanted, let\u2019s move on to our business agenda. Today we announced adjusted earnings per share of $4.72, closing out a successful 2018. We achieved results in the top half of our original 2018 guidance range while also delivering constructive regulatory outcomes and outstanding operational performance through hurricanes Florence and Michael. We also announced our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.80 to $5.20. The $5 midpoint of this range is consistent with our previous guidance for this upcoming year. This growth reflects the strength of our regulated utility franchises, a robust capital plan and recovery mechanisms that will deliver reliable and affordable energy to our customers and returns to our shareholders. We are extending our 4% to 6% growth rate through 2023 off the midpoint of our 2019 guidance range. This update in our [base yea] reflects the near-term impact of delays in Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which I will discuss further in a moment. We remain confident in the strength of our core businesses and the ability to grow with investments that deliver value to our customers and our shareholders. Our focus remains on execution and I\u2019d like to begin by highlighting our success in 2018. Slide 4 reinforces our ability to deliver. 2018 marked another year of outstanding performance across the Company with strong financial results, constructive regulatory outcomes and operational excellence. In addition to meeting our earnings commitments, we continued to grow the dividend in 2018, increasing it more than 4%. We also addressed the impact of tax reform. We achieved fair regulatory treatment across our jurisdictions providing benefits for customers while maintaining the utility\u2019s credit quality. We also issued $2 billion in common equity to further support our balance sheet. We were very active in the regulatory space during 2018. We received constructive orders in our North Carolina rate cases including coal ash cost recovery and completed rate cases for our electric utilities in Ohio and Kentucky. We also filed base rate cases in South Carolina. And as always, we remained focused on safety. We maintained our industry-leading safety performance for yet another year as well as operational excellence in the face of significant damage from Hurricanes Florence and Michael. Between the two storms, we restored 3 million outages and responded to flooding in many of our facilities due to historic rainfall. With our extensive preparation work and quick response efforts, we kept our infrastructure well protected. And despite the safe shutdown of the Brunswick Power Station during Hurricane Florence, our nuclear team achieved a capacity factor above 90% for the 20th consecutive year. This exceptional response was recognized by our industry as we were awarded EEI\u2019s Emergency Recovery Award and I\u2019m very proud of our employees resolve and tireless effort to restore power to the most devastated areas across the Carolinas and Florida. Finally, last month, we were named to Fortune magazine\u2019s 2019 list of the World\u2019s Most Admired Companies for the second consecutive year, underscoring that we\u2019re on the right path as we deliver value to customers and shareholders. As we look ahead to 2019 and beyond, Slide 5, emphasizes the strength of the Duke Energy portfolio and the growth profile we have ahead of us. Our diverse highly regulated infrastructure investments are at the core of our robust capital plan. Over 90% of our growth capital will be spent over the next five years across our regulated electric and gas businesses driving strong earnings based growth. These investments are consistent with our strategic vision for our Company in this period of transformation. Slide 6 depicts the strategic framework that we began sharing with you two years ago and since then we\u2019ve made meaningful strides to modernize the grid, generate cleaner energy and expand natural gas infrastructure. We\u2019ve engaged stakeholders to find solutions as the pace of change in our industry accelerates and we continue our work to modernize cost recovery mechanisms to better align with our investments. Our focus in these areas as well as maintaining our history of strong safety and operational performance enables us to transform the customer experience and deliver value to shareholders. Let me share an update on the progress we\u2019ve made executing our strategy. Moving to Slide 7, we continue to modernize our grid, which is the largest [P&D] system in the US with over 300,000 line miles across our service areas. We have outlined grid improvement plans in each of our jurisdictions to increase reliability, improve security, offer more options to customers and enable distributed generation. From smart meters to self-healing grid technologies, we are establishing the foundation for a more intelligent delivery system that provides more information such as usage and outage alerts and minimizes power interruptions. More than 62% of our customers across all six states now have smart meters, keeping us on track to meet our goal of 100% installation by 2021. We\u2019re also making greater use of battery storage. We announced plans to invest $500 million in storage in the Carolinas over the next 15 years and we\u2019ll maximize the versatility of this technology. Beyond storing and dispatching energy, we will include other system advantages such as supporting electric vehicles. We have an EV pilot program in Florida and our advancing programs in other jurisdictions. For regulatory treatment of our grid costs, we have rider mechanisms in the Midwest and a multi-year rate plan in Florida, both efficient methods for recovering our investments. We are also making progress to modernize how we recover costs associated with these investments in the Carolinas. In South Carolina, the commission approved our deferral requests for certain grid investments. We have since filed rate cases for our DEC and DEP utilities. Our request includes multi-year rate plans to efficiently recover our grid improvement investments while providing rate certainty for customers. In North Carolina, the DEC rate case order provided additional guidance. It stated the commission encourages ongoing grid investments and staying up-to-date on the latest technology, but they lack statutory authority to approve our requested grid rider. This feedback is useful as we continue our stakeholder engagement during the legislative session of the General Assembly currently under way. We are committed to advocating for reasonable solutions and we look forward to working collaboratively with stakeholders over the coming months. Our customers want a smarter energy future and our grid improvements will deliver just that. Moving to Slide 8, let me share an update on how we\u2019re reducing our environmental footprint. We have outlined plans to reduce our carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. This target is consistent with a pathway to achieving a 2-degree scenario and we are well on our way to meeting our goal. We\u2019ve retired more than 6 gigawatts of coal generation since 2011 including to two Crystal River Units in Florida retired in December. Over the next six years, we plan to retire another 1,200 megawatts of coal generation and replace it with lower carbon alternatives such as renewables and natural gas fire facilities. In 2018, we put both our W.S. Lee and Citrus County combined cycle plants into service and our Western Carolinas Modernization Project is on track for a late 2019 [in-service date]. These plants enable us to serve our Carolinas and Florida customers with cleaner, more efficient energy. In addition, our 11 nuclear units are fundamental to providing carbon-free generation to our Carolinas customers and essential to our long-term carbon reduction goals. As we look forward, we are evaluating subsequent license renewal for these facilities for an additional 20 years to continue serving customers with the reliable service they expect. And finally, we have a strong commitment to renewables and continue to invest in both our regulated and commercial renewables businesses. In Florida, we are building up to 700 megawatts of solar under our existing settlement agreement including our Hamilton plant that came online in late 2018. New rates were effective in January as approved under the Solar Base Rate Adjustment mechanism. In North Carolina, we are actively participating in the ongoing RFP process for 680 megawatts of solar energy under House Bill 589. Our regulated and commercial renewables businesses submitted competitive bids and we expect to be notified of the results in March. Projects will be placed in service by January 2021. Beyond the opportunity in North Carolina, our commercial renewables business is seeing strong demand for utility scale wind and solar projects across the US and is well-positioned to capture a meaningful share. We have visibility to a strong pipeline of future projects including over a 1,000 megawatts in late stages of development. This includes the recently announced 100 megawatt Lapetus solar project due to come online in the fourth quarter. The business successfully began using tax equity financing for new projects including our Shoreham Solar facility in New York that went into service last July. We will continue using tax equity to finance future projects. We also continue to seek a minority partner for our existing wind and solar portfolio as we look to recycle and reinvest capital from our assets. We have received interest from a number of bidders and if we are able to reach an agreement, expect to announce the transaction this spring and close this summer. We expect to use proceeds to displace future debt issuance needs. Moving to Slide 9, natural gas will play a major role in a cleaner energy future and we are leveraging the overlap between our electric and gas businesses to provide better service to our customers. Our LDCs have strong customer growth and with decoupling and other non-volumetric mechanisms in place, this growth translates into higher margins. The gas utilities also have solid capital investment opportunities consistent with our priority to deliver safe, reliable service, we continue to invest in integrity management. Piedmont is also providing the infrastructure to deliver gas for our dual-fuel projects at the Belews Creek and Marshall coal-fired facilities, which are expected to be completed over the next three years. We will use coal firing of natural gas at these plants in a similar project recently completed at the Rogers facility to reduce our carbon emissions and increase our flexibility to manage costs. Finally, we began construction this year on our $250 million Robeson LNG facility, which we expect to begin serving customers in 2021. These projects demonstrate the complementary nature of our franchises and advantages of joint planning to provide savings to customers. Moving to Slide 10, let me update you on the status of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. We remain committed to this project and the critically important benefits the pipeline brings to our region. Our Carolinas service territories are currently served by only one major interstate pipeline. ACP will bring needed diversity of supply by adding a second interstate pipeline with access to lower cost Marcellus and Utica gas. It will provide system pressure to Piedmont\u2019s distribution network in the eastern part of North Carolina allowing for cost effective service to new customers. And ACP will provide important infrastructure in an underserved area, increasing economic development in this part of the state. Over the last year, we have made significant progress working with state and federal agencies to complete permitting for the project. In 2018, we received major permits from the North Carolina and Virginia Departments of Environmental Quality. We also recently received the air permit for the Buckingham Compressor Station in Central Virginia. In the fourth quarter of 2018, there were a number of developments that impacted the project\u2019s scheduling cost. These developments include rulings from the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals on the Biological Opinion and the permit to cross under the Appalachian Trail. We are working diligently with our project partners to resolve these specific issues in the federal courts to resume construction as soon as possible. We expect a hearing at the 4th Circuit related to the Biological Opinion to take place in May. It is possible this issue could be resolved by the third quarter allowing construction to resume on Phase 1 of the pipeline route. Separately, the 4th Circuit vacated the US Forest Service permit for the pipeline to cross under the Appalachian Trail, stating the agency lacks jurisdiction to approve the crossing. We strongly disagree with the court\u2019s decision on this matter, which is counter to decades of pipeline crossings beneath the trail. ACP and the Department of Justice have requested an en banc review of this decision with the fall 15-member court. We expect to hear in the next few weeks if the court will hear our petition. In addition, various paths exist to address this issue including the judicial path already being pursued as well as legislative changes or federal administrative action. Given the current delays, we\u2019ve adjusted estimates for project schedule and cost. Our overall timeline assumes we\u2019re able to resume construction this fall and have the entire project in service in 2021. We will pursue putting the pipeline in service in phases with the Phase 1 portion in service in late 2020. After successful conclusion of the Appalachian Trail matter including a potential appeal to the US Supreme Court, the Phase 2 portion will be completed the following year. Should resolution of the challenges currently before the court proceed more quickly, this timeline could advance. This new timeline also entails an increase in project costs, now estimated between $7 billion and $7.8 billion and as a reminder, Duke\u2019s share of these costs is 47%. We will continue to provide updates throughout the balance of this year on this important project. Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to close by recognizing the Duke team for another year of strong execution. We delivered on our 2018 commitment. We addressed challenges that came our way with two historic hurricanes and court actions on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and we are clear on the growth and value we will deliver in the future. With a portfolio of well-positioned utilities supported by customer growth, a robust capital plan and constructive regulatory outcomes and a solid growing dividend, Duke Energy is positioned to deliver value to our customers and strong returns to our investors. Now, let me turn the call over to Steve. Steven Young : Thanks, Lynn and good morning everyone. 2018 was a solid year for the Company. As shown on Slide 11, our full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.72 was in the top half of our original 2018 guidance range and well within the narrowed range we provided in November. For the year, our electric utilities grew from higher pricing and rider revenues, including a partial year\u2019s contribution from the North Carolina rate cases. In addition, load growth was very strong and we had positive results in O&M from our continued cost management efforts. Weather was favorable for the year, but was partially offset by higher storm costs from a very active hurricane season. Finally, our electric utilities saw higher depreciation and amortization on a growing asset base. Our gas segment also contributed to year-over-year growth driven by Piedmont\u2019s margin contribution and as Lynn mentioned, we closed on our first tax equity finance solar project this year, driving higher earnings in commercial renewables. As expected, a lower [tax yield] on holding company interest as a result of the Tax Act partially offset the growth at our operating segments. Overall, we are pleased with the strong execution across the Company. Looking ahead, we\u2019ve set our 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance range at $4.80 to $5.20 per share with a $5 midpoint. This represents 6% growth over 2018 and is consistent with the guidance we previously provided, demonstrating our commitment to achieving our earnings objectives. We\u2019ve put together a strong plan for 2019. Earnings will be supported by our investment programs and associated recovery activities across our utilities as well as new projects in commercial renewables. In addition, we expect load growth, continued cost management efforts and ongoing AFUDC associated with the Atlantic Coast Pipeline to contribute to our results. Turning to Slide 12, we\u2019ve extended our long term earnings growth expectation of 4% to 6% per year through 2023. This is based off the midpoint of our 2019 EPS guidance range of $5 per share. Our growth over the next five years will be supported by a $37 billion growth capital plan, one of the largest in our industry. These investments will drive strong earnings base growth for our electric and gas businesses supporting our earnings growth objectives. Approximately half of our capital plan is committed to our energy grid investments at the electric utilities including expansion of services to new customers and our ongoing efforts to strengthen the grid. We will also continue to invest in our regulated nuclear units and transition our generation fleet to cleaner energy sources such as natural gas and renewables. We plan to continue renewables development in both our electric utilities and commercial business. In commercial, we have increased our capital investment to reflect the strong demand for projects in this business and we\u2019ll continue to utilize tax equity financing on new development projects. In our gas segment, our LDC investments will support new gas infrastructure such as the Robeson LNG project, new customer additions and integrity management. For our midstream business, ACP will continue to drive earnings growth. Our investments remain aligned with our vision to modernize the energy grid, generate cleaner energy and expand natural gas infrastructure. We will also strategically deploy capital, optimizing timing of our investments and minimizing regulatory lag. Turning to Slide 13, let me highlight a few trends we\u2019re seeing across the business that further support our earnings objectives. As noted on previous calls, our service territories are greatly benefiting from the population migration to the southeast. Customer growth in our jurisdictions remain strong and for the first time in six years, we saw an overall increase in usage per residential customer in our electric utilities. Within the commercial class, ongoing data center expansion and strength in hospitality and other services further supported growth. These factors drove retail electric load growth of 0.9% in 2018. We are encouraged by these results and we\u2019ll monitor these trends moving forward. We continue to assume 0.5% annual retail load growth throughout the five-year financial plan. We also remain focused on managing our cost structure. We have demonstrated strong capabilities in this area over the last five years, offsetting inflation and absorbing an increase from the Piedmont acquisition, to keep non-recoverable O&M costs flat. Moving forward, we will continue implementing digital solutions to streamline and automate processes including the use of new technology and data analytics to keep O&M flat over the next five years. Our cost management and capital optimization strategy is underpinned by our ability to align spend with customer needs and the expected regulatory calendar in order to minimize lag and earn our allowed ROEs. As you can see on Slide 14, our utilities maintain healthy ROEs and we expect this to continue as we execute on our regulatory calendar and recover our investments. We have modern regulatory recovery mechanisms in place in many jurisdictions. In Florida, customers and investors benefit from the predictability of the multi-year rate plan, which went into effect January 1st and lasts through 2021. In Ohio, the commission approved our global settlement in late December, providing clarity for our grid improvement program through 2025. As we look ahead, we expect significant rate case activity in 2019. We intend to file for updated rates at our Indiana, Piedmont Natural Gas, and DEP North Carolina utilities. We are also evaluating a rate case for DEC North Carolina. In South Carolina, we expect to complete the pending base rate cases that we filed last November. Evidentiary hearings are set for March 21st and April 11th for DEC and DEP respectively. If approved by the commission, we requested rates effective June 1st for both cases. As Lynn mentioned earlier, we have asked the commission to approve multi-year rate plans to support our investment programs. We look forward to working with relevant stakeholders to achieve constructive outcomes for our customers and investors. Moving to Slide 15, let me walk you through our 2019 financing plan. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet, which supports our credit ratings and ability to efficiently fund our [$50 billion] capital plan. Given a growing body of investment opportunities and hurricane-related financing needs as well as ACP delays, which particularly affect our 2020 outlook, we\u2019ve modestly increased our expected equity financing by $150 million per year. We expect to issue our annual equity amounts through a combination of our DRIP and ATM programs. Our planned equity issuances combined with our investment recovery strategy support our credit metrics over the planning horizon. Also, recall that our FFO-to-debt ratio is further supported by our refundable AMT credits, which we expect to receive between 2019 and 2022. We believe this financing plan prudently manages the balance sheet to support Duke Energy\u2019s credit quality and maintain financial flexibility as we execute our long-term strategy. Shifting to Slide 16, we understand the value of the dividend to our shareholders. 2019 marks the 93rd consecutive year of paying a quarterly cash dividend and we remain committed to continue growing the dividend in the future. We finished 2018 with a dividend payout ratio above [75%]. As we have said previously, our aspiration is to reduce that payout ratio over time, more in line with our peers, particularly given our robust capital plan. Over the near-term, we will moderate our dividend growth to better position ourselves within a payout ratio range of 65% to 75%, trending to the midpoint of this range over the five-year period. We believe this additional flexibility positions the Company for sustainable dividend and earnings growth over the long-term, while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet. Before we open it up for questions, let me turn to Slide 17. Our attractive dividend yield coupled with earnings growth from investments in our regulated utilities provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for shareholders. We have a history of operational excellence and an achievable financial plan making Duke Energy a solid long-term investment opportunity. We are positioned to deliver results for both customers and shareholders and are confident in the plan we have for 2019 and beyond. With that, we\u2019ll open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Greg Gordon, Evercore ISI. Please go ahead sir. Greg Gordon : Hello good morning. Lynn Good : Good morning, Greg. Greg Gordon : A couple of questions. When -- looking at the earnings guidance, one, I noticed that there\u2019s a significant increase in expected earnings contribution from the commercial renewables segment \u201819 over \u201818. So can you talk about how you\u2019re driving that? Is that from taking in ITCs or is that just a big step up in expected investment in getting plants online. And then the second question as it relates to that is if I look at the overall expectation for what AFUDC earnings were going to be from ACP in [\u201819 reported] low versus now, how much of a change was that, that you had to overcome? Lynn Good : Sure. Greg thanks. On commercial renewables, we have just seen a lot of market opportunity and as we look back at our history in this business, there are times as customers not only have an interest in renewables, but there is interest in pursuing the tax credits to a great extent. We\u2019ve seen a bit of a cyclical nature to this and has had a good track record in pursuing and achieving wins with a number of these projects. So, you\u2019re seeing the benefit of that in 2019. It includes both wind and solar projects and we have the majority of what is reflected in 2019 guidance already committed based upon work that the team has had under way in 2018. So, I think about the portfolio of businesses that we operate, commercial is a part of them and when we have an opportunity to pursue growth, we do that and you\u2019re seeing that in 2019. I think when you look at allowance for funds, one of the other things to keep in mind on allowance for funds trend is we did put a large capital project in service at the end of \u201818, that\u2019s Citrus and so some of the trend line that you see between 2018 and 2019 is a result of that in-service date of that generating station. I think in terms of Atlantic Coast Pipeline, there\u2019s no question that even as early as four months ago, we were expecting more capital to be deployed in \u201819. You may remember when we talked in November, we were projecting an in-service in \u201819 for part of the project and the rest in 2020. So, we have a slowdown in that spending, that resulted from some of the court decisions in December and we have reflected that in our guidance. We continue to remain committed to the plan and we\u2019ll work through this -- committed to the project, but I think we have some work to do around the core challenges in order to get construction going again. Greg Gordon : Okay, just a follow-up on the first answer. So, the pace of activity is higher and that\u2019s fantastic. Congrats on that, on the renewables segment, but is the earnings contribution partially driven by monetization of tax credits either ITCs or through tax equity and then is that what\u2019s driving the big increase? Lynn Good : Sure. There\u2019s certainly tax equity included in those results. Greg, you may recall that we\u2019ve been talking about tax equity as we had more clarity from tax reform on what our own tax position was. We have been pursuing tax equity. We\u2019ve closed our first project in July and have continued and plan to continue using that technique as we go forward. And so what you see in \u201819 is not only a combination -- not only investment tax credit related to solar, but there\u2019s also wind in those numbers. Greg Gordon : Okay. I\u2019ve got more questions, but I\u2019ll go to the back of the queue. Thanks, bye. Lynn Good : Thank you, Greg. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Lynn Good : Good morning, Michael. Steven Young : Hey Mike. Michael Weinstein : Hi, Lynn. Good morning. Hey, just a follow-up on Greg\u2019s question, so when you take in tax equity, you\u2019re booking that as earnings, is that true? Lynn Good : Steve, you want to talk about tax equity. Steven Young : Yes, the utilization of tax equity in the financing does guide you to certain accounting rules and on most of these renewable projects, whether it\u2019s tax equity or not, a lot of the recognition of the earnings is driven by the tax benefits, which is in the early stages of the project. Tax equity doesn\u2019t change any of that. The tax equity structures however do vary and how quickly income is recognized in solar and wind projects. So, it\u2019s not all upfront necessarily, but most of these renewables projects certainly with tax equity and also without are going to have earnings recognition in the early years depending on PTCs or ITCs. Michael Weinstein : Got you. Is there -- can you quantify how much of the $230 million is from tax equity and tax credits? And then related question to that is the guidance going forward fpr 4% to 6% through 2023, is how much -- what happens to the commercial renewable segment during that period? Is this a contributor to that 4% to 6% or as tax credits perhaps fall off, is that a subtractor from it? And maybe you can fill us in on that. Lynn Good : Yes, Mike, I would respond to the first part of the questions by saying tax attributes are an important part of the net income for anyone who invests in renewables. So, you should think about it that way. And I think over the five-year period, we see commercial renewables, based on the pipeline that\u2019s in front of us having a more meaningful impact in the early part of the plan and then I would think about over the longer-term, our approach being opportunistic. Again, if we see demand, we\u2019ll pursue it, but we really look at this business as being complementary to the 4% to 6% growth that we\u2019re driving in the utilities. Michael Weinstein : Another -- just one more question on earnings growth. Are you -- did you actually quantify how much of the AFUDC drop off in 2019 is impacting earnings? Lynn Good : All of the AFUDC. I\u2019m not sure I understand the question. Michael, could you do that again? Michael Weinstein : What\u2019s the cents per share impact of that? Steven Young : It\u2019s approximately $0.05 that we\u2019re seeing from the lower spend pattern that we\u2019re estimating... Lynn Good : This is Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Michael Callahan : Atlantic Coast Pipeline. That\u2019s correct. And a rule of thumb on Atlantic Coast Pipeline is that it provides about $0.05 of earnings -- AFUDC earnings per quarter, but we\u2019re seeing the slower spend impact by about $0.05 and we\u2019re working through that with our guidance the $5 we\u2019ve accounted for that. Michael Weinstein : Also, you said that rate base growth is 6% going forward and you used to talk about 7% as a result of tax reform from the return of excess deferred taxes. Is that still a possibility -- is there is still -- is it just that the return of excess deferred tax is slower in the early years and that\u2019s why you\u2019re still at 6% or is 7% still possible? Lynn Good : Mike, I think there\u2019s always upside potential on regulated investment. We just progressed our guidance a year forward and 6% we believe is a good planning assumption. We have -- we focus on the \u201819, \u201820, \u201821 most heavily and will continue to develop and originate investments into \u201821 or I\u2019m sorry \u201822, \u201823, but I think 6% is a really solid plan and we do have upside potential. Steven Young : And Mike, I think some of the math here comes into play. When you\u2019ve got a starting year that does not have the effect of tax reform in it and then you\u2019ve got a change such as we saw in the out years that can lead to a higher percent. It depends on what year you\u2019re starting. If you\u2019re starting with a year that has the impact of tax reform layering in throughout the period, that can affect the percent, but as Lynn said, our early years have very strong growth typically the out years, we develop as we move along and 6% is a good number for our rate base growth. Michael Weinstein : Thanks a lot for the update. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Jonathan Arnold of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead sir. Jonathan Arnold : Good morning guys. Lynn Good : Good morning. Steven Young : Good morning. Jonathan Arnold : Quick question just on -- I understand you\u2019ve rebased the starting point for the 4% to 6% growth to $5, but you were saying before that you\u2019ve expected to sort of dip below off of the original base and then kind of get sort of to the high-end at the end of the plan. It doesn\u2019t seem to be what you\u2019re saying now off the new base. So I just want to clarify whether we should still be thinking that or whether it\u2019s more sort of middle of the range would be a core assumption from this new base? Lynn Good : Jonathan, we committed to delivering at the low-end of the range for \u201819 and we\u2019ve done that by hitting the $5 and then we\u2019ve set 4% to 6% off of $5, which is within that guidance range we had talked about previously, but certainly the midpoint has been affected by the near-term uncertainty around Atlantic Coast Pipeline, both the scheduled delay and the cost increase. And so as we look at 2019, if Atlantic Coast Pipeline goes quickly, we do still have the potential to get to the high-end of the range in \u201820, but we believe a planning assumption within that range is more realistic until we can work through these legal challenges. So, we just thought it was appropriate given where we are with that project to reset the base, but I think it\u2019s -- there\u2019s a great deal of overlap between what we\u2019ve given you here and where we were previously and we continue to believe strongly that we have a strong growth plan that we\u2019ve put in front of you. Jonathan Arnold : Okay and then just a quick housekeeping one. I noticed you had a fairly sizable write-off at the Citrus County in the fourth quarter. Why would that be? Lynn Good : We have -- we\u2019re in the middle of a contractual -- finalizing a contractual dispute with Fluor. Jonathan, you may have seen some press coverage of this as they have been finalizing that project. We are in the middle of this and from an accounting standpoint, recognized exposure, but that isn\u2019t the end of the story. We still have legal remedies that we\u2019re pursuing that we would expect to resolve in 2019. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. Thank you, Lynn and then just one other thing, it has been reported I think in the press and also exciting Duke spokesperson that you\u2019re one of the bidders pursuing Santee Cooper. I just wonder if you could speak to that at all and specifically what your criteria would be and just remembering back to Piedmont, you\u2019d talked about it being very unique and adjacent and therefore something that was very high priority for the Company, so I\u2019m just curious if you have any comments. Lynn Good : Jonathan, throughout the process that South Carolina has undertaken, our objective has been to support the state and the state has called for and been actively seeking investment interests in Santee Cooper. We are one of the four parties that has met the qualifications. We have submitted a couple of proposals for the state to consider, but I would also say this is very early stage. There\u2019s a law that needs to be passed, the General Assembly needs to make some decisions and that could take some time here in 2019. So, we remain committed to our organic growth plan and supporting the state of South Carolina as they look at alternatives. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. I think I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks very much guys. Lynn Good : Thank you, Jonathan. Operator : We will now take our next question from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Shar Pourreza : Hey, good morning guys. Lynn Good : Hi Shar. Steven Young : Hey Shar. Shar Pourreza : Most of my questions were answered, but Steve let me let me ask you, because you talked about sort of the drag from sort of the AFUDC and the pushing out of ACP. Does sort of your current outlook include refunds from the unprotected add it that could potentially have an effect of actually sort of raising the rate base? So I\u2019m kind of curious, I mean we\u2019ve -- obviously if you look at the guidance now and the rebasing, it looks somewhat a little bit lower than the sort of the prior guide, how is sort of the refunds of unprotected added, how does that sort of play into the growth picture? Steven Young :  Well, yes, Shar, we have worked with our regulatory commissions in the various states on the handling of income tax refunds related to the Tax Act and the excess deferred tax flow backs and that\u2019s incorporated into our plan, it\u2019ll vary per jurisdiction. Some states are giving it back over a 10-year period. Some states are offsetting it with other types of costs such as storm cost in Florida, but that\u2019s being weaved through the plan and that does have the impact of raising rate base as well and we do have that as a growth item in our rate base that we\u2019ve talked about in the past. So that\u2019s in there. Shar Pourreza : Okay, so that\u2019s in there. Okay and then Lynn I know you\u2019re working through a legislation around sort of grid mod and how to sort of think about potentially getting a rider mechanism, but assuming legislation doesn\u2019t sort of time the well the way you\u2019re anticipating, you guys are going to be in for serial filings on an annual basis. So, how should we sort of think about the spending of that profile, assuming that you don\u2019t get legislation, maybe the commission approves trackers, but if you don\u2019t and you\u2019re going to be in rate cases, do you see sort of -- any sort of downside to that grid mod spend? Lynn Good : Shar, I think the capital we\u2019ve put in front of you is capital that we would spend under the rate case scenario as well. So, we have contemplated both scenarios in our long-term guidance. So I don\u2019t see a lot of downside to grid spend as a result of what you\u2019re describing. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Got it and just lastly on Santee Cooper, obviously the bids are confidential, but can you just maybe elaborate whether there would be an interest to do a management service agreement around that system versus an outright acquisition? Lynn Good : So, Shar, we have looked at both of those and have put proposals on the table that would accomplish both objectives. Shar Pourreza : Perfect. All right. Thanks guys. Lynn Good : Thank you so much. Steven Young : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning everyone. Lynn Good : Good morning. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So just a few clarifications of some prior questions here. Just starting out on the commercial renewables spending plan, is that mostly contemplated to be solar just as we start to calibrate our models on future tax credits. Obviously ITC versus PTC and then also just given the differing accounting treatments, that\u2019s a one year accounting on the ITC not five-year, right? Lynn Good : Let me catch up on that for a moment, Julien. There\u2019s a mix of solar and wind in both \u201819 and \u201820. I would say a [little heavy] of solar in \u201819, but a mix of both in both years and under the accounting model that Steve was talking about before, you do have an opportunity for a range of recognition, two years to seven I think on solar and then PTC. So, Steve you want to add to that? Steven Young : Well, that\u2019s right. What Lynn referred to is correct. You can structure the solar deals with tax equity so that the income recognition can be spread over one year to seven years as an example and we\u2019ll do what suits us and makes the most sense to us in that situation. The wind projects, the PTC recognition is typically over the seven year period. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right, and just to go back to the question about what\u2019s reflected in the outlook that maybe squaring the last question, the procurement that you talked about, I believe, North Carolina earlier up to 800 megawatts. Is that contemplated in the outlook that you\u2019re disclosing now first. And then separately with respect to that also just curious is that all outside or within the utility, just with respect to where you\u2019re allowed or intend to participate from? Lynn Good : So on HB -- HB589, I think Julien is your question for North Carolina. So, we have over the five-year period, put some additional capital in commercial renewables reflecting the potential impact of 589 and all of that capital is sitting in commercial renewables. So, you may, if you compare back to last year, you\u2019ll see about [$1 billion] more, which is reflecting of not only market conditions, but also what we hope to pursue in North Carolina. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you. And then one quick clarification here, the ACP range that you\u2019ve delineated $7 billion to $7.8 billion. I think that\u2019s slightly different than what Dominion talked about $7 billion to $7.5 billion, I know this will pick you, but just curious. Any slight changes or is this more about the configuration that you guys are thinking about? Lynn Good : Julien I appreciate that question because it\u2019s right on top of what Dominion disclosed. They just talked about it in two phases. So $7 billion to $7.5 billion, assuming more timely resolution of the Appalachian Trail. If the Appalachian Trail goes to the Supreme Court, they said another couple of hundred million. All we did was put up the whole range together. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Understood. Thank you for the clarification. Lynn Good : Yes, right on top of Dominion. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thanks. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Praful Mehta of Citibank. Please go ahead. Praful Mehta : Thanks so much. Hi guys. Lynn Good : Good morning. Steven Young : Hello. Praful Mehta : Good morning. Hi. So maybe with all the earnings questions addressed mostly, maybe we touch on credit. As we look at Slide 15, firstly you talked about equity issuances going up a little bit through the plan. Is that driven by pressure from the agencies to kind of shore up the credit a little bit? Or can you just give us a little bit more color of what specifically was driving the increase in equity need? Lynn Good : So Praful, we are committed to our ratings, we\u2019ve demonstrated that with our response to tax reform and as we look at the increase in cost in Atlantic Coast Pipeline that we\u2019re projecting as well as the fact that we spent $1 billion this year on storm response. We thought it was appropriate to bring some additional equity into the plan in the form of the DRIP and ATM. This gives us some flexibility for uncertainty and we\u2019ve also talked about the fact that we will consider pursuing securitization of the storm cost as well, which we think is positive for credit. So, all of this is within the context of maintaining the commitment to our balance sheet while also responding to impacts to the business. Praful Mehta : Got you. That\u2019s super helpful then. So in terms of the FFO-to-debt metric, then as I look at again Slide 15, the AMT credit I\u2019m assuming is helping support the credit and the FFO-to-debt through the 2020 time frame, but it seems to be going up even though the AMT is rolling off by \u201822. So just wanted to understand like what\u2019s driving the uptick in FFO-to-debt in that \u201821 to \u201823 time frame, even though AMT is in fact rolling off during that same period? Lynn Good : Sure, Steve you want to take that? Steven Young : Sure. Praful, a couple of things are happening here. Number one, we\u2019ve got the exploration or the conclusion of the heavy spend on coal-ash in the Carolinas that will end essentially in \u201819 and then that spend level will drop. So as you get coal-ash expenditures built into rates and the actual cash expenditures go down, that can certainly help cash flows. In Florida, we\u2019ve had in 2018, three generation projects : Citrus County, Osprey, Hines Chillers go into rates. So those will turn into cash annuities as well. In 2019, we will complete the Western Carolinas modernization project and get that into rates and that\u2019s over a $1 billion of investment. So we\u2019ve got a number of activities that are aligned there. Additionally, when Atlantic Coast Pipeline goes into service that\u2019ll \u2013 [in 2021] in that time frame, when that\u2019s completed, that\u2019ll turn into a strong cash annuity. So, we\u2019ve got some big projects rolling through rates that\u2019ll help push up FFO. Praful Mehta : Got you. Perfect. And then just finally just clarifying in 2020, the increase in Holdco debt, is that driven by the increase in commercial renewable investment that\u2019s funded by parent debt or is there something else driving the 33% to 34% Holdco debt in 2020 time frame? Steven Young : Well, I think you\u2019ve got a couple of things going on here. You\u2019ve got certainly the delay in ACP, so that puts some pressure there. We\u2019ve got expansion of the commercial renewables as well. Those types of issues as we have lag on recovering hurricane cost of over $1 billion that can put some stress on holding company debt as well. So those are some things I\u2019d point to. Lynn Good : Yes and Praful, I wouldn\u2019t point to any single item. I think this is kind of just the financing of the whole picture including, the results of \u201818 and what we\u2019re looking at for \u201819. Praful Mehta : Understood. Again, thanks so much guys. Lynn Good : Thank you. Steven Young : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys thanks for taking my question. One or two just minor items when I think about the commercial renewable business. How do you think about what\u2019s the right scale and size of this business, meaning relative to everything else. When you\u2019re thinking longer-term and kind of what you want that business to look like relative to the core regulated subsidiaries? Lynn Good : Michael, I would say it\u2019s complementary, but given the size of the regulated businesses we operate on electric and gas, it will always be a modest contributor. We\u2019re talking about $200 million of net income. So we\u2019ll continue to grow it opportunistically. We think it\u2019s, there\u2019s an incredible wave of support for renewables. We think it\u2019s the growing part of the generation portfolio in the US, we want to be a part of it, but it will take a long time for it to have a meaningful percentage impact on the portfolio of the Company, given the size and the growth profile of what else we operate. Michael Lapides : Got it, but when you think about the commercial renewable business and its growth rate that\u2019s embedded in your multi-year four or five-year EPS growth rate guidance, do you assume that, that business like the gas utility and pipeline business grows at a faster rate than the core electric utilities? Does it grow more in line with the electrics or beneath that? I\u2019m just trying to -- I\u2019m trying to parse a little bit about what\u2019s in the guidance levels? Lynn Good : Yes, so it grows faster in the short-term part of the plan, Michael, and levels off in the back part. By the time 2023 rolls around, we begin to enter a period where we have some wind projects reaching their PTC expiration. So, I would think about it as being a stronger contributor in the front end than the back end. Michael Lapides : Got it and then last one just curious tax rate and guidance seems to be a little bit on the low side. Is that anything at the Utilities or is that all -- and I think someone touched that. Is that all just related to tax credits as you bring assets in the service on the commercial renewable side? And then should we assume that tax rate stays at that -- consolidated tax rate stays at that level through the whole guidance period or does it creep up over time? Steven Young : Michael, the tax rate could change over time. We\u2019ve lowered it because primarily to give back of EBIT. We\u2019re starting to push those taxes back through to rates in our various jurisdictions and that\u2019ll push the effective tax rate down. Now there\u2019s an offset in revenues as you give these taxes back and lower rates, but it will change the effective tax rate. Now the addition of renewables and the credits associated with that will also push it down, but a player in here is the excess deferred taxes that are being given back. So as we move through time, we\u2019ll look at how that excess deferred are giving back whether that\u2019s ratable or whether there\u2019s fluctuations in that and those types of things plus the renewables cycling up or down, those things could push the effective tax rate around a bit. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, much appreciated. Lynn Good : Thank you, Michael. Operator : We will now take our next question from Andrew Weisel of Scotia Howard Weil. Please go ahead, sir. Lynn Good : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Weisel : Good morning. Steven Young : Good morning. Andrew Weisel : My first question is on the outlook for CapEx and midstream. How much of that is more than just -- of [$2.9 billion] included. How much of that is more than just the main ACP. In other words, do you have expansions at ACP? Do you have other greenfield projects? What else is in that bucket please? Lynn Good : It\u2019s primarily ACP, Andrew. We\u2019ve actually dialed back in this five-year plan expansion capital until we have a better sense of in-service and completion of this project. We have a little bit of placeholder capital, maybe $250 million sitting out there in \u201822, \u201823, but I would think of it as primarily ACP. Andrew Weisel : Okay, how would you describe your appetite for more greenfield midstream construction going forward? If you saw another opportunity come along, how willing would you be to jump on it? Lynn Good : That\u2019s a really good question, Andrew. You\u2019re catching us mid-cycle here in Atlantic Coast Pipeline. We\u2019re a believer in the infrastructure. I think one of the things that gets overlooked in this discussion of these pipelines is how critical they are to our customers and we think about our Piedmont system and the need to continue to provide pressure for growth in that area. We think about the infrastructure in North Carolina supporting economic development and our power system, which has a lot of renewables in the eastern part of the state. So, we\u2019re a believer in the infrastructure investment. We\u2019ve learned a lot about how to move through these, the stakeholder engagements, it\u2019s important to permitting, et cetera. So we like the business I think, but we\u2019d be thoughtful about what opportunities exist that we might want to pursue. Andrew Weisel : Got it. It makes sense and just a quick one on the dividend. Before I ask a question, could you repeat what was the targeted payout ratio you had for five years out? Lynn Good : So, we have indicated a range of 65% to 75%, Andrew, but we\u2019d like to moderate our payout ratio. We\u2019re above 75% today. By the end of the five-year period, we\u2019d like to be closer to 70%, still committed to strong growth of the dividend. We think our yield is very attractive. We have a long standing history of growing the dividend, but believe that some moderation of the payout ratio positions the Company for more sustainable growth given our robust capital plan. Andrew Weisel : Okay, but just to clarify there, back of the envelope math to me suggests around a 3.5% CAGR. You previously guided to 4% to 6% just as recently as EEI. What would you say were the biggest deltas then as far as being a bit more conservative on the dividend growth? Lynn Good : I think this near-term uncertainty that we\u2019ve experienced around Atlantic Coast Pipeline and/or where we\u2019re looking at \u201820 and \u201821 is being influenced in that way. And then as we think about $1 billion of hurricanes that we\u2019ve experienced, we also think about our desire to continue growing with a very robust capital plan. We believe all those things taken together represent a very attractive dividend plus growth profile for our investors and think that moderating the dividend payout ratio as part of that whole picture makes a lot of sense. Andrew Weisel : All right. Thank you for clarifying. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the call over to Ms. Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks. Lynn Good : Very good. Thank you, Kevin. Thank you all for participating today for your questions. Our IR team will be available both today, tomorrow and ongoing for any further questions. We appreciate your investment in Duke Energy. So, thanks so much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Duke Energy First Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Callahan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Callahan : Thank you, Ally. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Duke Energy's first quarter 2019 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide two presents a Safe Harbor statement which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today's materials. Please note the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. As summarized on slide three, during today's call Lynn will provide an update on the quarter including legislative and regulatory activity in the Carolinas. She will also discuss progress on our strategic initiatives. Steve will then provide an overview of our first quarter financial results and the insight about the economic and load growth trends. He will also provide an update on our 2019 financing activities before closing with key investor considerations. With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Today we announced reported and adjusted earnings per share of $1.24, marking a strong start to the year. We are on track to achieve our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.80 to $5.20 and our long-term earnings growth target of 46% through 2023. We remain confident in the strength of our business and the ability to grow with investments that deliver value to our customers and our shareholders. In the first quarter, we advanced our strategy to modernize the grid, generate cleaner energy, and expand natural gas infrastructure. We added more than 400,000 smart meters, and continue to deploy self-optimizing grid technology across our system. We made progress on the construction of the Asheville combined-cycle unit as part of our Western Carolinas modernization project, and we filed for the next wave of solar generation projects in Florida. Our investments in these key areas combined with our attractive growing service areas are foundational to growth in our electric and gas utilities. We have several noteworthy accomplishments in the quarter, so let me highlight a few of them on slide four. First, we continue to advocate for modern cost recovery mechanisms in our service territories, and we're pleased to see the introduction of related legislation in North Carolina, our largest jurisdiction. We also recently announced 1,250 megawatts of regulated and commercial renewable projects that we will either own or procure on behalf of our customers. Approximately two-thirds of these projects will be built in our service territories. This was a remarkable start to the year as we expand these important resources in our portfolio. As we invest in new renewables, we are recycling capital from existing projects having announced the transaction to sell a minority stake in our current commercial renewables portfolio to John Hancock. Finally, we received multiple recognition of our employee's efforts to generate clean, reliable energy for our customers. EEI named Duke Energy one of the industry leaders in safety for the fourth year in a row. This is especially meaningful as safety is our highest priority and is foundational to operational excellence. And in April, Forbes recognized Duke Energy as a top employer for the second year in a row, highlighting our efforts to engage, develop, and retain our workforce. I'm proud of the work our employees do every day keeping the customer at the center of everything we do and driving efficiencies across our business. Turning to slide five, let me update you on recent legislative and regulatory activities in the Carolinas. In early April, Bipartisan legislation was introduced in both chambers of the North Carolina General Assembly that would give the Utilities Commission the authority to consider alternative cost recovery mechanisms. This would include multi-year rate plans, ROE bands and storm costs securitization. We were pleased to see this important legislation passed the Senate last week, moving out of the House for consideration. If enacted into law, North Carolina would join 35 states across the nation that already have alternative cost recovery frameworks in place, a multi-year rate plan would benefit customers with bill predictability and certainty as we make important investments for the future. It will provide the commission another tool to address the changing nature of utility investments, while still retaining the authority to review investments and the prudency of incurred costs just as it does today. Similarly, storm cost securitization would provide the commission new authorities consider financing structures to mitigate customer bill impacts from major storm activity. This legislation is a step in the right direction for North Carolina, and we will continue to provide updates as the session progresses. On the regulatory front, Piedmont Natural Gas, filed its first rate case in North Carolina in six years on April 1.. We requested an $83 million increase from the revenue requirement to recover costs for necessary infrastructure investment. We expect new rates to be effective by the end of the year. In South Carolina, we received directives from the commission regarding our pending DEC and DEP electric rate cases. Aspects of the directives were constructive including a 53% equity component of the capital structure and a 20-year flow back period for unprotected excess deferred income taxes. However, we were disappointed with certain critical aspects of the rulings. Of note, the commission adopted a 9.5% ROE and this allowed recovery of certain coal ash costs deemed to be related to implementation of North Carolina's coal ash Management Act. We will look for the written orders to be issued in the coming weeks to better understand the commission's position on these issues. However, it is clear the regulatory and related business environment in South Carolina has changed and this will affect the investment climate for the state in our industry and in others. Our commitment to safe and reliable operations for our customers is unchanged. However, our appetite for further growth and discretionary investments will be influenced by our ability to earn a fair and reasonable return. At 9.5% the ROE in South Carolina is the second lowest in the southeast and the lowest among regulated utilities. Further, our coal ash management cost are consistent with our obligations under state and federal regulations and have been prudently incurred on behalf of customers in both North and South Carolina. Both states have enjoyed the benefits of a combined generation and transmission system over many decades and the decommissioning of assets including storage of ash should rightly sit under the same sharing mechanism. We intend to make a motion for rehearing by the PSC and are prepared to file an appeal of these and potentially other portions of the case. Moving to slide six, let me update you on our strategic initiative. Our transition to a cleaner energy future is well underway. Our $1.1 billion Western Carolinas modernization project in Asheville remains on track for a late 2019 in service date. The project combines various aspects of our cleaner energy strategy, retiring an older coal plant, building new natural gas units, installing renewables and upgrading transmission and distribution infrastructure. We also engaged the community increasing energy efficiency and demand response adoption and effectively collaborating on the successful solution to better serve the growing region. Renewables development is also off to a tremendous start in 2019. In Florida, we announced three new solar projects totaling 195 megawatt as part of our commitment to add 700 megawatts of solar under our multi-year settlement agreement. We expect to begin recovering the cost of these investments under the solar base rate adjustment mechanism once the projects are in service. In North Carolina, the independent administrator issued results of the first RFP for renewable energy under House Bill 589 with 602 megawatts of utility scale solar projects clearing the auction. In total, Duke Energy was awarded 270 megawatts with most projects coming online at the end of next year. Including those awarded under HB589, our commercial renewables businesses have added multiple projects to their growing backlog. Combined with the earnings from our existing portfolio, these projects give us confidence in our ability to maintain the earnings contribution of this segment over the five year plan. We have strong visibility to approximately 90% of the earnings target for 2019 and 2020, and approximately 60% of the target through 2023. This success clearly demonstrates our ability to capture a share of the robust market for contracted renewable generation. We expect these markets remain strong as it transitions away from tax incentives over the next few years. Turning to the grid, we continue to add new technology to make it more resilient, secure and reliable. In Florida, base rate increases under our multi-year rate plan went into effect this January. Annual rate increases over the next three years support approximately $1.1 billion of grid modernization investments of Duke Energy, Florida including smart meter deployment and other system upgrades that will reduce outages, shorten restoration times and support renewable energy growth. We are also building electric vehicle infrastructure in Florida and waiting approval of our proposed EV programs in the Carolinas. Our recently announced North Carolina initiative would be the largest in the southeast and help to fund the adoption of electric school buses and public transportation with approximately 2,500 new charging stations. Shifting to natural gas infrastructure, I want to share a brief update on the Atlanta Coast pipelines. Oral arguments before the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals regarding the Biological Opinion and incidental take statement are underway today. We expect an order in the case within 90 days. We are also pursuing an appeal to the Supreme Court for the U.S. Forest Service permit to cross national forests and the Appalachian Trail. We expect the petition to be filed in the summer and are optimistic that the Department of Justice and Solicitor General will join this request. As discussed on our February earnings call, we expect construction to resume this fall and the first phase of the project and service by late 2020 and the full pipeline and service in 2021. We continue to advance discussions with customers regarding this approach. Our cost estimate remains in the range of $7 billion to $7.8 billion. We remain committed to this important project. ACP will provide much needed infrastructure to eastern North Carolina and drive economic growth across the region. Turning to slide seven, I want to take a moment to update you on our ash basin closure efforts and the recent announcements in North Carolina. On April 1 we've received an order from the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality stating that we must excavate all remaining low priority and low risk based on interstate. Well, we share the same of permanently and safely closing all basins, we disagree with the DEQ's position. We estimate fullest excavation would cost an incremental $4 billion to $5 billion versus the cap in place or hybrid closure methods proposed by our utilities. This would impose significant costs on customers without any measurable benefit to the environment. The agency's position also fails to recognize the internal impact of open basins and excavation activities that would occur over decades. Under full excavation scenario the state would need to take action to extend closure deadlines under state and federal laws based on the amount of ash to be addressed. We recognize it's within DEQ's authority to set the environmental policy of the state. However, in the interests of pursuing what is best for our customers we submitted a comprehensive appeal to the North Carolina Office of Administrative Hearings. We expect the appeal would take approximately 9 months to 12 months. In parallel we are developing a range of closure options to support compliance with the order, while also maintaining a focus on cost for our customers. Under our full excavation scenario it's important to note that it would take time to pursue permitting and construction of new basins to receive excavated ash. As a result the most significant financial impact would occur outside the five year plan with about $200 million to $400 million of incremental closure costs incurred in the next five years. We will continue to safely and permanently close the ash basins in the Carolinas. We are currently excavating basins where it makes sense to do so and have already removed more than 20 million tons of ash in North Carolina. We've also advanced the construction of three ash reprocessing units in the state. Our surface remains unchanged. We will protect the environment and do what's best for our customers. Before turning it over to Steve, our work in the first quarter demonstrates our ability to deliver on our commitment and create value for our customers and investors. We are executing our strategy to generate increasingly clean energy and make improvements to the energy grid. We're expanding our regulated renewables footprint with significant deployments announced in North Carolina and Florida and we remain on track for smart meters to be fully deployed in all of our jurisdiction by 2021. This technology will complement other grid enhancing investments to provide customers with the information they expect on improving grid resiliency and security. I'm proud of our progress in the first quarter. As we continue transforming our business and creating a smarter energy future. Our goal is to position Duke Energy to be the leading infrastructure investment and I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. So with that I'll turn it over to Steve. Steve Young : Thanks, Lynn. I'll start with quarterly results on slide 8 including our adjusted earnings per share variances to the prior year. For detailed information on various drivers and the reconciliation of reported to adjusted results please refer to the supporting materials at the company today's press release and presentation. On a reported and adjusted basis 2019 first quarter earnings per share were $1.24 this compared to reported and adjusted EPS of $0.88 and a $1.28 respectively last year. For the quarter, lower adjusted results compared to the prior year were primarily due to unfavorable weather and shared illusion, partially offset by growth from investments at the electric and gas utilities. Within the segments, electric utilities and infrastructure was down $0.10 compared to the prior year. These results were primarily driven by mild winter weather across the southeast in the current quarter and lower retail volumes on a weather normal basis. In addition, higher depreciation and interest expense impacted results. Partially offsetting these unfavorable drivers were base rate increases in Florida and North Carolina and higher rider revenues. Shifting to gas utilities and infrastructure, results were up $0.10 in the quarter. The increase was primarily due to a true up adjustment related to income tax recognition for our equity method midstream investments. Higher margins at the LDCs also contributed to growth. In our commercial renewable segment, results were down $0.01 for the quarter. The decrease was primarily due to below normal wind resource this year. Finally, other was up $0.01 for the quarter and share dilution drove a $0.04 decline due to the shares we issued in December to settle last year's equity forward agreements. Overall, these results and our strong execution to start the year give us confidence that we will achieve our full-year earnings target and deliver on our commitments. Turning to slide nine, on a rolling 12 month basis weather retail electric load growth was 0.5%. While results in the quarter were weaker than expected, we believe they were driven by temporary factors and continue to expect load growth of 0.5% for the year. Our residential class continues to drive growth with an overall increase in volumes of 0.6% on a rolling 12 month basis. Strong customer growth continues to support volumes and employment in our service territories remains robust with four of our jurisdictions in the top 15 states for job growth. We're also seeing strength in the commercial class with sales up 1% over the rolling 12 months, ongoing data center expansions and strength in hospitality and leisure segments helped offset ongoing weakness in retail. Finally, sales in our resident industrial class declined 0.3% on a rolling 12 month basis, an improvement from the 1% decline reported last quarter. Growth in the quarter was driven by strength in the manufacturing of metals rubber and plastics, as well as phosphate and chemical processing. We will monitor over the balance of the year, but overall these retail volume trends along with a healthy economy and growth in our jurisdictions support our long term planning assumption of 0.5% retail load growth for our electric utilities. Turning to slide 10, we were pleased to announce the sale of a minority stake in our commercial renewables business to John Hancock, net proceeds of $415 million will be used to offset long term debt financing needs at the holding company. The minority interest represents approximately 1,200 megawatts of our existing portfolio, and the partnership also allows for co-investment in certain renewables projects in the future. After adjusting for project level debt the $1.25 billion enterprise value is an attractive valuation for a wind heavy portfolio in which we will retain the tax credits. The transaction is modestly accretive to earnings and consistent with our financial plan. John Hancock's investment provides clear validation of the strength of our existing portfolio, and we look forward to working together to deliver long term value for our customers and investors. Closing should occur in the second-half of the year after customary approvals. Now turning to our financing activity, in March, good progress, Duke Energy progress completed its first green bond issuance following a similar issue by Duke Energy Carolinas last November. These bonds help fund our utility's ongoing renewables investments and attract a diverse set of investors. Also in March, Duke Energy Corp issued $1 billion in preferred stock, the largest ever utility preferred issuance, and a testament to investor confidence in our business. These shares provide 50% equity credit with the rating agencies, and fully satisfy the equity content securities target in our 2019 financing plan. As we outlined in February, our 2019 financing plan also includes a $500 million common equity target. And today we have priced or issued approximately half of that amount. Through early April we priced $200 million of equity under a forward contract through our ATM program. We expect to settle this equity forward in the fourth quarter of this year. I'll close with slide 11, our attractive investor value proposition is founded upon our growing dividend which currently yields approximately 4.1%, coupled with earnings growth of 4% to 6% from transparent low risk investments, we offer a compelling risk adjusted total shareholder return of 8% to 10%. Our scale, constructive service areas and ability to execute make Duke Energy a solid long term investment opportunity. With that, let's open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Michael Weinstein from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein : Hi, guys. Good morning. Lynn Good : Hi, Michael. Steve Young : Good morning. Michael Weinstein : Hi. With the one-time true up on the gas side, I mean, gas midstream investment side, is that included in your -- or you including that in your ongoing guidance off the $5 number, 46% off that? Steve Young : Yes. That's in our adjusted number. We often have adjustments in true ups in the tax arena with taxing authorities. We've typically included them in adjusted earnings. Michael Weinstein : Okay. I mean, that would imply that there is some other positive offset that's ongoing, right, that makes up for that, I guess -- in the future? Lynn Good : Yes. Michael, the point I would make is this is the first quarter of the year. You know, we started with some weakness in weather and volumes. We expect those to turn around a bit in the second and third quarter, as we look at the strength of the economy. So I would ask you to think about the full complexion of all the businesses we operate over the full-year, and we will have true ups whether it's in tax or in regulatory, these are things that happen over the course of the year and then developing our plan. We always assume that something will develop as the year progresses. So I\u2019d put it in that context. Steve Young : Yes. So, we've typically not updated within the range till after the third quarter when we get a feel for where things are going in the weather in that particular quarter. Michael Weinstein : Got you. Okay. What was the exact size of that? Steve Young : It was about $0.06. Michael Weinstein : Okay, all right. Thank you. Lynn Good : Thanks. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Steve Young : Hey. Good morning. Lynn Good : Hi, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. So perhaps just to focus first on the coal ash side of the equation obviously you've had some developments of late which -- to which you've already referred to in your prepared remarks. I wanted to follow-up a little bit on understanding the range of outcomes and the timeline for providing an updated capital outlook just based on the appeals process that you described at DEQ. It seems like there are some big decisions that have been made of late and obviously taken up seemingly by the governor, et cetera. Can you describe how some of these big variables could move and what that means for this incremental capital? Lynn Good : Sure. And let me break it down, Julien, and see if this answers your question or we can continue the conversation. The appeal process for the order will take nine to 12 months. There has been a series of dates established by the hearing officer or the administrative law judge. We expect that those dates could move a little bit as people respond whether or not they will be prepared but I think nine to 12 months is a good planning assumption for the appeal process. I think in terms of capitals we've already begun to do some work on the closure costs and as we look at the next five years we believe the order if it stands as written would add about $200 million to $400 million over the five year period. And the reason it is relatively modest is because it will take time for permitting, for finding the land, for constructing the landfill and all of the other costs de-watering and other things that would occur under any closure method, those are already included in our capital plan. So I -- you should think about the majority of this impact being after the five year period giving us plenty of time to evaluate how that fits into affordability, reliability, customer rates and so on. And we'll just continue to update you as it move through the legal process and as we learn more moving forward. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent, just quickly back on the ACP project, appreciate your prepared remarks here as well. Just wanted to understand little bit on the timeline of process here, obviously you need to make strategic decisions and sourcing generation -- supplying generation anyway. I'd be curious on the timeline there to -- that you need to come to terms. And then separately just in terms of the -- with respect to the jeopardy argument and the biological order here, how do you think about timeline and potential overlap with respect to permits and rerouting there as well, given the park permitting issues? Lynn Good : Sure. And you know, Julien, I would point to two things, maybe three things that we're monitoring. So, the Biological Opinion Incidental Take hearing is today. And as you noted there are discussions around impacts to the biological opinion. This is the Rusty Patched Bumble Bee that you'll probably learn more about and as will we as the court renders their opinion and then a number of questions around the incidental take statement which really challenges are coming in front of the court for a second time. So, these are species that we understand well. We would expect an order within 90 days. And if there is work to do as found by the court then we would expect that to occur over a one to two month period. I'm just estimating that within the construct of what we've seen before from the court, but we'll know more when the order comes out and have an opportunity to give you more specifics on that. So, that's the one thing I would be watching for. The second is the Appalachian Trail that is progressing. A petition seeking the Supreme Court review will be filed this summer. We're optimistic that the government will support. And so we'll see milestones over the course of the summer on that item. And then as you would expect we are continuing discussions with customers which are important part of this project on the status -- on the approach around phase construction Phase 1, Phase 2, Mountains, Buckingham South, revised timeline, revised cost, and those discussions will continue over the course of the year as well. So we'll continue to update you on timeline. We understand we've got some decisions to make depending on how all of these legal challenges play out, we will continue to update you as we learn more and have more transparency on when the construction will begin. We are planning that we'll be able to begin construction later this year. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you very much. Best of luck. Lynn Good : Thank you, Julian. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman : Hi, good morning. Lynn Good : Good morning, Steve. Steve Young : Good morning. Steve Fleishman : Hi. So, on the -- first of all, on the South Carolina orders that you referenced, how much coal ash was disallowed in those orders? Steve Young : There was an amount mentioned in the order of 470 million for -- in the DEC order, I have not looked at the most recent directive. And again I would emphasize I want to wait till I see the full order, and that $470 million number is a system wide number, so the allocation would then have to occur to that number. Now when I look at the full number, and I'm seeing now that's about 330 million is in the DEP order. Again that's a system wide number. Lynn Good : So you should be thinking, Steve, kind of in the 20% to 30% range for DEP, and for DEC and 10% for DEP. Steve Fleishman : All those numbers, okay. Lynn Good : That's right. That's right. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then, can the commission still change its view or are they just - before they put the written order or the written order is just getting the details around what they've already decided? Lynn Good : So, we would think about it this way, Steve, I think the order that we're expecting to come out you know kind of mid-month, will be further documentation around the directive. And then we have 10 days to file a request for reconsideration, which we intend to do. And then, the commission has about 20 days to respond to that request for reconsideration. So, I think it would be that 20-day period where potential reconsideration of this -- the terms of the directive could occur. We are anxious to read the order because we have very limited information now on all of the -- elements here and the real depth of the legal reasoning that underpins this. So, that is the work that remains and we should expect to see those as I said a moment ago within - within a few weeks. After that reconsideration period that's when we would evaluate appeal. And so, then you'd move through an appeal process with a longer timeline of course to work through the court system. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And I know this is not directly related, but maybe indirectly does this affect any interest you might have in Santee Cooper? Lynn Good : You know, Steve, we've been a part of the process -- a competitive process I think we've talked about that before. We believe we had a lot to bring to the table for this state whether it's an outright purchase or management of those assets. We've operated in the state for 100 years. Legislation is moving through the state, which we believe will establish a process in a way forward that would include additional due diligence and other things. But I think it's fair to say that we will closely evaluate further investing in the state in light of these directives, but those decisions are yet to be made, we have had a long history in South Carolina, it's been a constructed jurisdiction. But I think with this directive we need to learn a little bit more. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And then one separate topic question just on the North Carolina legislation, could you just -- is there any timeline for house ruling on it as the governor had a view, and just how would it actually then turn from a law and being implemented in the case? Lynn Good : Steve, there is no specific timeline for the legislature in North Carolina. So you can expect it to move through the House over the coming weeks. It's really hard to forecast how long that will take. We believe the strong bipartisan support and sponsorship has been favorable. Certainly, getting it out of the Senate and moving it to the House we have strong bipartisan sponsorship in the House. We believe the policy is very sound. So this is what we will continue to update as progress is made, but it's difficult to forecast a specific timing for the legislation. In terms of implementation, having the legislation in place allows us to include innovative solutions as we move forward with future rate cases, but the timing and approach for that is yet to be determined. So, more to come and we'll, as I said before keep everyone updated as the session progresses. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Caroline Bone from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Caroline Bone : Good morning. And thank you for\u2026 Lynn Good : Hello. Caroline Bone : Good morning. Steve Young : Good morning, Caroline. Caroline Bone : Hi. Okay, great. I was just hoping, I mean Steve actually just asked a few of my questions but I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about how these South Carolina PSC directives might impact your longer term outlook. Does it have, does it push you to the lower end of the growth rate if it were a 9.5% ROE we were to be approved. I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that. Lynn Good : Yes. Caroline, I think when we think about the scale that South Carolina represents to do, we believe we're still positioned to grow within the range of 4% to 6% that ROE signal though does indicate to us an important factor in allocating capital as we go forward. And so you know when I talk about growth capital and discretionary capital and other things we will evaluate the placement of our capital based on where it's attractive to invest. And that's a part of our five year cleaning process and we'll have more to say about that both as this appeal progresses and as we share additional refinements to the five year capital plan. Caroline Bone : All right. Thanks very much. And then\u2026 Lynn Good : Thank you. Caroline Bone : -- I know you sounded a very confident tone on the ability to achieve your outlook for the commercial renewables business but I was just wondering if you could just help us understand the earnings trajectory this year, how you kind of close the gap between the $13 million earned in Q1 and the $230 million targeted for the full-year? Lynn Good : Caroline that's a good question. A couple of things I would point to. So if think about our renewables business between operating and wind assets it's about 50% of what we expect and there was a slow start to the year for wind resources. So the $13 million you should not consider to be a normal run rate, but it was reflected or impacted by weather. And then we will bring projects on in the second quarter and later in the year, solar primarily that will impact those numbers. So you've got a shaping issue on commercial renewables that really links to the question that you're asking this morning. Steve, would you add to that? Steve Young : Yes. So, that's correct, Lynn. And Caroline we're going to bring a couple of projects and they're going to boost the earnings this year, get it up above the $200 million level. And we've got good line aside as Lynn said to 2019 and 2020 earnings and good line of sight overall to 60% of the earnings. The projects will bring in the early part of our five year plan, the solar projects are going to have income recognized in the one-year to two-year period. But just to give you a flavor for it, we've got a lot of longer term wind profile that we're building as well, and a matter to think about is for us to keep the net income level above $200 million through the five-year plan, given that what we've already built in place. We need to close about 250 megawatts to 300 megawatts of solar per year and that's on the one-year to two-year recognition schedule. And I think that's very doable, when you look at the amount of megawatts that we've put together already in 2019 and the CPRE process that will continue throughout. I think we have a good capability in earnings trajectory in commercial renewables. Caroline Bone : Good. Thanks very much. I appreciate it. Lynn Good : Thank you, Caroline. Operator : We'll take our next question from Praful Mehta from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Praful Mehta : Thanks so much. Hi, guys. Lynn Good : Hi, Praful. Praful Mehta : Hi. So, may be just staying on commercial renewables, congratulations on your asset transaction or the sale transaction. Just want to get a little bit more control in terms of firstly how competitive the process was because there is a lot going on in that side? And do why keep the tax assets given you are unable to actually utilize them right now given your tax profile, why do you decide to keep the tax assets as the part of that transaction? Steve Young : Sure, Praful. A couple of comments here, was a competitive process we did seek bids and then narrowed it down to a short list and work from there and Hancock became the best partner providing the best overall value. So it's quite a competitive process and a lot of interest from financials and international, global and so forth. So we feel good about that process. And then, regarding keeping the tax benefits of these assets, Hancock does not have a tax appetite. And what we found is you look out you the people that are pursuing the underlying PPA cash flows they're not looking for the tax attributes people looking for the tax attributes, they are not looking for the underlying cash flow. So it's a logical matching here. So, we'll maintain those tax benefits as we move forward and we've utilized some of those tax benefits to date. You can only sell what's remaining. So we'll still have those to keep in our portfolio. Praful Mehta : Understood. And is there any plan to do further sales in the commercial renewable side or do you think at this point you kind of have the transaction done for at least the near term? Steve Young : Well, Hancock has an option on some development projects that could provide further proceeds that have been defined as part of this arrangement and we'll continue to look as we develop projects in the future whether there is interest with our existing partner or others. Praful Mehta : Got you. Thanks. And then just finally on the effective tax rate point, Q1 effective tax rate was 9.6%, I'm assuming because of that one time that you talked about, but just wanted to clarify that. And then also longer term do you still see that 12% to 14% as something that stays not just in 2019 but going forward through your forecast, or does that change over time? Steve Young : You're correct, Praful. The quarterly effective tax rate of 9.6% was driven down by the booking of the tax adjustment, and that won't recur in future quarters. I expect by the end of the year we'll be within the 12% to 14% range. I don't want to try to handicap now with all that's in front of us as to whether it's lower than that or where it would be, I'd stick with that for now. Praful Mehta : Understood. Thanks so much guys. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ali Agha from SunTrust. Please go ahead. Ali Agha : Thank you. Good morning. Lynn Good : Good morning, Ali. Steve Young : Good morning. Ali Agha : Good morning. Lynn and Steven, I apologize if you may have addressed this. I did come on a little late on the call. The ROEs that were set on the South Carolina both the rate cases of 9.5% are below obviously what you previously had and below what your budget is for this year of earning you know 10% to 10.5% overall in Carolina ROEs. Just wondering how that impacts or what kind of headwind, earnings headwind does that create, and what are some of the offsets against that? Lynn Good : Ali, the ROE that you referenced of course is disappointing. There were constructive elements to the order the equity pad of 53%, the amortization of excess deferred taxes. And so as we look at 2019 earnings we always plan for a range of outcomes and believe that the results of this case fit within our planning but as we talked about on the call and in some of the subsequent questions we do intend to request rehearing on the coal ash and the ROE item as well as potentially some others and we're also consider an appeal of the case and the ROE we will have an impact on the way we think about additional growth and discretionary investment. Ali Agha : I see. And linked to that, Lynn, I mean from historical cases of precedent do you find that you know the ROEs that get said in South Carolina that you see much influence when North Carolina rate cases are dissolved and ROEs are set, is that a good correlation between the two? Lynn Good : My expectation, Ali, for North Carolina is that they will continue the good work that they've done over many years acting in an independent manner, reviewing the evidence in front of them and we would expect the commission in North Carolina to continue to behave in that fashion. So I think it's premature to reach a conclusion on cases yet to be filed in North Carolina on how South Carolina is going to invoice now. Ali Agha : I see. Thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Lapides : Yes. Hey, guys thanks for taking my question\u2026 Lynn Good : Hi, Michael. Steve Young : Hi, Michael Michael Lapides : Hi, Lynn and Steve. Real quick, and you've touched on this I think a little bit. The attorney general's lawsuit, I know you're probably limited in what you can say given its ongoing litigation. Is that just dealing with the last rate case and how is that rate case dealt with coal ash recovery or is that dealing with the broader policy of what is the level - what is the process for coal ash recovery or is the coal ash recovery something that should be recovered at all. I'm a little confused about just kind of the main tenant of that case and whether, it's just a one-off of the last rate case that got resolved by the commission or is it more kind of a policy focused one longer term? Lynn Good : It's the former, Michael. It is an appeal of the rate case. And so I would -- have you look at it in that context because it's exactly what it is and we believe the order out of North Carolina was very well written, very strongly supported on the regulatory laws in North Carolina, and we'll be vigorously defending that case as you would expect. The timing on that is you know briefing will occur during 2019. We expect a hearing late this year or early next, and then potentially a decision in a six month or so time frame. You may remember the last appeal from the attorney general in North Carolina was on ROE in our last case and that took about two years. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then a follow-up question a little bit on Florida, legislation just passed it sitting on the governor's desk in terms of storm hardening. How do you think that would impact your capital spend plans in Florida, if the governor signs it. And given your rate agreement now would you still qualify for incremental rate increases tied to that legislation or in the near term next two years to four years or do you have to wait for the right deal to kind of expire or roll off? Lynn Good : Michael, the way I'd think about it is that's very solid policy and legislation that I think will serve Florida well, particularly as you think about storm hardening and resiliency, our multiyear rate plan runs through 2021. So, I would think about that legislation is being impactful to our business after 2021; it really gives us an opportunity to look at how to extend and continue important energy delivery investment. You may recall we've got $1.1 billion being deployed through now and 2021. This would set the contracts for more capital spending beyond that period. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you. And thanks, Steve. Lynn Good : Thank you. Steve Young : Thank you. Operator : And I'll now turn the call back over to Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks. Lynn Good : Well, thank you, Ally, and thanks to everyone who joined today. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy. And as always, our team is available for follow-on questions, and look forward to seeing you in the near future. Thanks again for joining. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Callahan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Callahan : Thank you Derrick. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining Duke Energy's second quarter 2019 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO, along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide two presents the Safe Harbor statement which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today's materials. Please note, the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. As summarized on slide three, during today's call Lynn will provide an update on the quarter and progress on our strategic initiatives. She will also discuss legislative and regulatory activity in North Carolina. Steve will then provide an overview of our second quarter financial results and an insight about the economic and load growth trends. He will also provide an update on our regulatory and financing activities this year before closing with key investor considerations. With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Mike, thank you and good morning everyone. Today, we announced strong results for the quarter with reported and adjusted earnings per share of $1.12 compared to $0.93 in the prior year. Our results to-date represents 6% growth over last year and give us confidence as we reaffirm our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.80 to $5.20. We also reaffirmed our long-term earnings growth target of 4% to 6% through 2023. With solid growth across all three operating segments, we are executing our long-term strategy to transform the customer experience and deliver value for our shareholders. Our investments in the energy grid, cleaner generation and natural gas infrastructure ensure Duke Energy is well-positioned to build a smarter, low carbon energy future. In addition, we remain committed to the dividend and for the 13th consecutive year, we increased our quarterly dividend to shareholders. Shifting to operations, let me highlight several noteworthy accomplishments on slide four. First, Piedmont Natural Gas was recognized as one of America's most trusted brands among utilities, continuing to prove that franchise's value as well as its unwavering dedication to safety and impressive customer service. And we also remain steadfast in our focus on operational excellence. I am very proud of our employees' commitment to providing reliable, affordable and increasingly clean energy to our customers every day. This was exemplified the strong performance of our system during the recent sustained heat wave. Our teams demonstrated exceptional preparation and collaboration across the company and the fleet performed well while serving near record loads in the Carolinas, the Midwest and Florida. Turning to slide five, let me provide an update on how we are advancing our strategic initiatives to generate cleaner energy. In our electric business, the $1.1 billion Western Carolinas Modernization Project in Asheville remains on track. On August 5, the combined cycle plant successfully achieved first fire, an important milestone in the process to bring the unit online in late 2019. As a reminder, our comprehensive plan for this region includes retiring an older coal plant, building new natural gas combined cycle unit, installing renewables and upgrading transmission and distribution infrastructure. We have also engaged the community to increase energy efficiency, demand response adoption and our products and services offerings as we better serve this growing region. In Indiana, we filed our integrated resource plan and rate case in early July. Consistent with our cleaner generation strategy, key components of our plan include accelerating coal plant retirements and replacing them with natural gas units and renewables. Steve will discuss the elements of the rate case filing in more detail in a moment. We also continued to advance innovative solutions across the Southeast, including renewables, battery and EV infrastructure. In Florida, we are executing on the investment plan that underpins our multiyear settlement agreement. The Florida Commission has approved the recovery of 344 megawatts of previously announced solar projects under the solar base rate adjustment mechanism. This represents nearly half of the 700 megawatts we will be installing through 2021. We also announced 22 megawatts of battery storage projects in the state this quarter, kicking off the first wave of our planned 50 megawatts pilot program. In the Carolinas, we continue to engage stakeholders in our proposed electric vehicle pilot program. Electrification is an important part of the low carbon future and we will forward to spurring EV adoption in our communities with this infrastructure. Also in North Carolina, the first RFP for solar energy under House Bill 589 is complete. The second RFP is expected to launch this October and we look forward to participating in the next round of bidding. In our commercial business, we expanded our portfolio of projects during the quarter. In June, the 150 megawatts North Rosamond solar facility began delivering energy to customers in California. This is the largest solar project in our renewables fleet to-date and the energy generated from the project will be sold to Southern California Edison under a 15-year PPA. We also announced 650 megawatts of new project this quarter including the acquisition of 37 megawatts of Bloom Energy's distributed fuel cell technology which will come online over the next 18 months. We continue to bring more visibility to our growth prospects in this segment and are evaluating a modest level of investment to safe harbor several solar projects preserving the full investment tax credits through our five-year plan. We now have line of sight to substantially all of our growth targets for 2019 and 2020 and approximately 70% over the five-year plan. Shifting to our gas business on slide six. ACP Project Partners filed a petition on June 25 taking a Supreme Court review of the Appalachian Trail decision. We are pleased to have the Solicitor General join the petition in support of the case and we expect the court to decide later this fall if it will agree to hear the appeal. We also recently received an order from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals vacating the project's Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement. We are evaluating this order and will work with the Fish and Wildlife Service to resolve any deficiencies. In anticipation of this ruling, work has been underway, including survey work to address certain issues identified at the May 9 hearing and confirmed in the excavation order. Our current expectation is that construction could resume by year-end, recognizing there are several steps that need to take place before we move forward. We continue to target in service for the first phase of the project by late 2020 and full pipeline in service in 2021. Our cost estimate of $7 billion to $7.8 billion remains unchanged. Finally, we are moving ahead with the construction of our $250 million Robinson LNG facility in North Carolina. This infrastructure will help Piedmont continue providing customers with the most affordable and reliable supply of natural gas during peak usage days, protecting customers from price spikes and volatility when extremely low temperatures create higher than normal demand for natural gas. We expect this facility to be in service during 2021. Each of these project aligns with our strategy to expand natural gas infrastructure as we bring much needed gas supply to the underserved Southeast. Moving to slide seven, let me share an overview of recent developments in North Carolina. Senate Bill 559 is pending before the North Carolina General Assembly. As a reminder, this bipartisan legislation was introduced in both chambers in early April. As written, it would allow the Commission to consider alternative cost recovery mechanisms including storm cost securitization, multiyear rate plans and ROE bands. Importantly, the Commission would retain its authority to review investments and the prudency of incurred costs just as it does today. If enacted into law, North Carolina would join 35 states that already have alternative cost recovery frameworks in place which generates significant customer benefits and incents investments necessary to transform our energy infrastructure. A multiyear rate plan in North Carolina would provide bill predictability and through investments in the energy delivery system result in fewer and shorter outages for customers while enabling more solar and battery installations. Further, storm cost securitization would save customers 15% to 20% on storm costs. Stakeholders have provided useful inputs throughout the legislative process strengthening the Bill by creating additional consumer protection. The current version of the Bill also provides for utility investments to support low income communities. The Bill, which is sponsored by the leading members of the House and Senate has passed the Senate and moved through three required House committees. The Bill currently remains in the Rules Committee of the House as the general assembly addresses other priorities, specifically the 2019 budget. The next step for the Bill is a vote by the Full House before moving to the Senate and ultimately the Governor for his consideration. Given there is no set end date for this session, we will monitor development and continue our advocacy work in support of the legislation. The Bill sponsors remain committed to Senate Bill 559 and the substantial benefits it offers to our customers and our state. Shifting of coal ash, I am extraordinarily proud of the work underway to meet our commitments in North Carolina. We successfully closed all three high priority sites ahead of their 2019 compliance deadline despite hurricanes and other severe weather of the last few years. We are also advancing work at the remaining sites. The legal process to appeal the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality's order to excavate all remaining low rent and low priority basins is also underway. While we share the same goals of permanently and safely closing all basins, we disagree with the DEQ's position and filed an appeal in April outlining our case. Last week, the Office of Administrative Hearings heard arguments on a partial motion to dismiss filed by DEQ. The judge dismissed claims related to the procedure DEQ used in reaching a decision while allowing the substantive claim on the decision to excavate to move forward. We plan to proceed with the appeal, standing firm that the DEQ decision is not in the best interest of our customers and communities. We estimate full excavation would cost an incremental $4 billion to $5 billion versus the cap in place or hybrid closure methods proposed by our utilities, imposing significant cost on customers without measurable benefit to the environment. We expect the appeal process could take nine to 12 months and we will keep you informed as we reach milestones during the process. Before turning it over to Steve, I would want to reiterate our confidence in our long-term strategy and our continued ability to deliver on our commitments. As the past quarter shows, we are making strides improving the energy grid, transitioning our generation of fleet and increasing natural gas infrastructure. With significant investments in renewables, progress on regulatory and legislative front and ongoing stakeholder engagement, we are advancing our long-term vision for Duke Energy. And with that, I will turn it over to Steve. Steven Young : Thanks Lynn and good morning everyone. I will start with quarterly results on slide eight including our adjusted earnings per share variances to the prior year. For detailed information on variance drivers and a reconciliation of reported to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. On both a reported and adjusted basis, 2019 second quarter earnings per share were $1.12. This compared to reported and adjusted earnings per share of $0.71 and $0.93 respectively last year. For the quarter, higher reported and adjusted results compared to the prior year were primarily due to growth from investments at the electric and gas utilities, the commercial renewables project placed in service and favorable timing of O&M expenses. Within the segments, electric utilities and infrastructure was up $0.13 compared to the prior year. The segment continued to benefit from base rate increases across multiple utilities as well as higher rider revenues that include recovery of our Midwest grid investments. O&M was also favorable $0.07 in the quarter. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher depreciation from a growing asset base and higher interest expense. Shifting to gas utilities and infrastructure, results were up $0.02 in the quarter. The increase was largely due to growth from our midstream investments. As a reminder, we expect the LDC businesses to deliver the bulk of their remaining earnings contribution in the fourth quarter. In commercial renewables, results were up $0.06 driven primarily by our North Rosemont solar project placed in service. This was partially offset by below normal wind resource and a prior year favorable contractual settlement. Finally, other contributed $0.01 for the quarter and share dilution drove a $0.03 decline, given we issued shares in December to settle last year's equity forward agreements. Overall, we are pleased with our strong results for the first half of the year and our solid execution gives us confidence that will achieve our full-year earnings target and deliver on our commitments. For perspective on key considerations for the back half of the year, please see the slide we provided in the appendix. Turning to slide nine. We operate in jurisdictions with strong customer growth and economy. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather normalized retail electric load growth was 0.5%, consistent with our full-year expectation. Our residential class continues to contribute to our results with an overall increase in volumes of 0.6% on a rolling 12-month basis. Robust customer growth fueled by population increases in our attractive service territories support volumes. Our jurisdictions also enjoy strong employment. Nearly 25% of all jobs created over the last year across the nation are in states we serve. We are also seeing strength in the commercial class with sales up 0.7% over the rolling 12-months. Data center expansions continue to lead growth in the sector with strength in the hospitality and leisure segments also helping to offset weakness in big-box retail. Finally, sales in our industrial class declined 0.2% on a rolling 12-month basis, a slight improvement from last quarter. As expected, results continue to be impacted by 2018 production declines for a few large customers and recent outage activities that continue to influence the 12-month rolling average. Going forward, we believe these specific outliers will continue to improve. At a macro level, economic indicators for our service areas remain strong and reaffirmed our long-term assumption of 0.5% retail load growth for our electric utilities. Turning to slide 10, let me update you on our active regulatory calendar. In July, we filed our first Indiana rate case in 16 years. As Lynn mentioned, the case presents the road map to our cleaner generation strategy and also incorporates modern regulatory recovery mechanisms. These include forward-looking test years and a five-year decoupling program for residential and commercial customers. The requested $395 million revenue increase would occur over two years and is based on a 10.4% ROE and a 53% equity component of the capital structure. Key drivers of the request include additional depreciation as we accelerate retirement dates of our coal fleet in the state and investments to serve more than 100,000 customers added since the last rate case. We expect hearings for the case to commence in January 2020 with rates effective mid-2020. Let me move to Piedmont Natural Gas, which filed its first base rate case in North Carolina in six years on April 1. We requested an $83 million revenue increase to recover costs for necessary infrastructure investments. The evidentiary hearing is scheduled for August 19 and we expect new rates to be effective by the end of the year. Finally in South Carolina, we filed a motion for rehearing of our DEC and DEP electric rate cases in May. We requested reconsideration of the 9.5% ROE and the disallowance of certain coal ash costs deemed to be related to implementation of North Carolina's Coal Ash Management Act. On June 19, the state's Public Service Commission issued a directive denying our motion for rehearing. We are awaiting the full order from the commission and are prepared to file an appeal to the South Carolina Supreme Court. Turning to our other utilities. Duke Energy Kentucky filed its 30-day notice of an electric rate case on August 1. We also continue to evaluate rate case timing in North Carolina for both DEC and DEP and expect to file rate cases for both later this year. We are executing on our regulatory strategy to recover our investments to serve our customers and remain focused on collaborating with stakeholders throughout the process. Turning to slide 11, let me give you an update on our continued efforts to support our credit ratings and financing plan. First, in May, S&P affirmed our rating of BBB+ and revised their rating outlook to negative from stable. Some of the items they highlighted are singular in nature and will evolve over time. S&P provided a 12 to 24 month timeframe to work through these issues and we are focused on reaching resolutions during that time. We remain committed to our current credit ratings, which reflect our low risk business with tremendous scope and scale, geographical and regulatory diversity and constructive regulation. As we outlined in February, our 2019 financing plan assumes a $500 million common equity issuance. And to-date, we have priced or issued approximately $420 million of that amount. We expect the balance to be issued through our drip in the third and fourth quarters. We also expect our 2019 credit metrics to be supported by refundable AMT credits of $575 million and the close of our commercial renewables minority stake sale to John Hancock, both of which should occur this fall. Finally, in July, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 2%. This is consistent with our plan to moderate our dividend growth over time, particularly given our robust capital plan. We continue target a payout ratio range of 65% to 75%, trending to the midpoint of this range over the five-year plan. Our financing plan prudently manages the balance sheet to support Duke Energy's credit quality and maintain financial flexibility as we execute our long term strategy. I will close with slide 12. Our attractive investor value proposition is founded upon our growing dividend which currently yields approximately 4.3%. Coupled with earnings growth of 4% to 6% from transparent low-risk investments, we offer a compelling risk-adjusted total shareholder return of 8% to 10%. Our scale, constructive service areas and ability to execute make Duke Energy a solid long term investment opportunity. With that, let's open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Shar Pourreza : Hi. Good morning guys. Lynn Good : Hi Shar. Good morning. Steven Young : Good morning. Shar Pourreza : I want o delve into Carolina's policy a bit and this may be a question for Lloyd. So in South Carolina, you obviously got a low ROE negative outcome for coal ash which is on appeal. How is sort of the dialogue going in North Carolina? I mean they are obviously seeing what's going on and the two jurisdictions have been somewhat aligned in the past. You have the Piedmont case and you are eventually going to file a Duke in progress in the state. So how is sort of the conversations flowing in North Carolina, especially head into these GRCs? Should we be, I guess, concerned as there is some readthrough to what we are seeing in South Carolina just from a regulatory constructs standpoint? Lynn Good : Shar, I want to be clear that we do not see a readthrough from South Carolina to North Carolina. North Carolina has historically been a very fair, impartial regulatory jurisdiction that recent decisions based on facts and evidence presented follows the law and we would certainly expect that to be the case as we think about regulatory outcomes moving forward. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just on Senate Bill 559, obviously in the prepared remarks, it's still sitting at the House. It's not on the calendar for a vote and you certainly highlighted budgetary, the lack of a budget as being one of the items that's curtailing it. Is there sort of anything else you want to highlight that could be a push or take? Do you have sense on sort of timing? Are we going into sort of a special session? So any sort of incremental color on how the conversations are flowing would be very helpful. Lynn Good : Shar, we are very pleased with the progress that we have made with Senate Bill 559. We have strong bipartisan sponsorship of the Bill and as you indicated we are in the Rules Committee really waiting for other priorities that the general assembly has in front of them, specifically the budget. I think it's important to recognize that the Bill sponsors have continued to express support for moving this legislation and it is historically the case in North Carolina legislation that is taken up after the budget or even during the budget impasse. So we continue to actively advocate for the Bill. We think the customer benefits and the policy involved and embodied in the Bill are very strong. Customer benefits, reducing costs for storms in the range of 15% to 20% and the policy allows for stakeholder settlements and engagements to develop an investment plan that delivers value to customers from storm hardening and resiliency to renewables and the improvements to customer experience. And recently in the House, we also added provisions to encourage low income investment. So we think the combination of good policy and clear benefits to customers are very strong attributes of this Bill and we continue to advocate for it. I think in terms of timeline, we will have to see how these other priorities continue to shape up. There is no specific timeline I would share with you but we will continue to update as progress is made. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Thanks. And then just strategically, Lynn, it's the last question. I know you typically shy away from commenting on any strategic moves, but you have given us some sense on how you think about Santee Cooper and its ongoing process in South Carolina. If you sort of shift to Florida, is there any interest in JEA in case they pursue a privatization. I know the process has obviously started and the bids are due by September 30. Is there any interest there? Lynn Good : Shar, we evaluate opportunities as you would expect as we see things that are in our service territory that we think are a fit for us. So that would be evaluating within the broad context of our business plan and we feel like our organic growth opportunities are quite strong and that would be our highest priority. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Congrats guys and a great start. Lynn Good : Shar, thank you very much. Steven Young : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will next go to Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Gordon : Thanks. Good morning. Lynn Good : Hi Greg. Steven Young : Good morning. Greg Gordon : So you guys had a really solid first half, $2.36. And I know that you are flagging some timing issues. But even with those taking into account, adding back your assumption of normal weather and then to the point that some of the point Steve made with regard to things that were positive drivers in the first half that should continue to be positive drivers in the second half, you would only need to do $0.01 better than last year and the second half to hit current consensus of $4.90, $0.15 to get to $5. So I am just wondering if you are comfortable articulating a little bit more where you think you will be in the range given that it seems that consensus might be a little bit too low for the balance of the year unless I am missing some big negative driver that you haven't disclosed? Lynn Good : Greg, I will take a shot and then Steve can follow. Our typical approach on resetting specifics within the range follows the third quarter, which is just a statement of the obvious about how significant third quarter can be. So we will fine-tune the range as we historically have. But I think all the points that you are making around the strength of the start to the year, the way we are executing on our plan and the way we are controlling costs, the way we are working through the regulatory outcomes gives us high degree of confidence within the range. So I think we are off to a strong start and the team is focused on delivering and I would expect us to do that. We are waiting to see how weather in August and September plays out. So Steve, have at it. Greg Gordon : How has weather been through June and July relative to normal? Lynn Good : So July has been hot, no doubt. Steven Young : Yes. July has been, we have seen some favorable weather. The only thing I would add in terms of the last half of the year is a bit about shaping. We do have, as I mentioned, some renewables projects that are slated for the fourth quarter and we provided an exhibit there. But in terms of the year as a whole, I echo Lynn's comments entirely. Greg Gordon : Right. So just to build on that statement, you do have a higher amount of net new megawatts coming into service in the second half, about 136 megawatts net increase even though that is shaped predominantly in the fourth quarter. At least that's the way -- Lynn Good : That's right. And you know, Greg, the other thing I would point to in the back-half. You may remember Florence and Michael in the third and fourth quarter last year. So that's another consideration you should think about O&M. Greg Gordon : Great. Well, congratulations. It sounds like you are setting up to have a good year. So congrats. Lynn Good : Greg, thank you. I appreciate that. Steven Young : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd : Hi. Good morning. Lynn Good : Good morning Steve. How are you? Steven Young : Good morning. Stephen Byrd : Doing great. I wanted to touch base on North Carolina legislation. If the legislation is enacted into law, I just wanted to get your latest thoughts on what kinds of opportunities, perhaps longer term in terms of additional CapEx, additional areas of focus and spending, if you get that kind of support that we have been looking for? Lynn Good : Stephen, I would think about Senate Bill 559 as being an enabler of the capital plan that we have laid out over the next five years. You will note that we have more investment in the delivery system really as part of the transformation that we see in the industry. And Senate Bill 559 provides an investment mechanism that very closely matches the investment with the benefits to customers. So I would think about it in that context. And as we think about actually putting 559 into place, we envision a stakeholder process where the investment priorities over the multiyear period would be informed in a way that drives the policy in the state. So this gives us a great opportunity to tailor those investments in a way that drives customer benefits. But I would think about it within the context of the plan we have in front of you. We think it's just very good policy at this stage of the industry transformation. Stephen Byrd : Understood. Then maybe shifting gears over to Atlantic Coast. Obviously we had an unfavorable ruling from the Fourth Circuit on the Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement. In the unfortunate event that a revised BO and ITS is also vacated again, would you mind just talking at a high-level to the range of options, whether that be other sources of natural gas, other approaches, generation needs? And I think just I know it's premature to talk in detail about what might be done but just as I am trying to think through the range of options would you mind just speaking to that at a high level? Lynn Good : Sure. And there two points I would like to make, Stephen, on this. And the first one is that we are evaluating this order working closely with project partners and also efficient wildlife. There is an extensive work done. We are in the field now with surveys. And our intention is to work with the partners and federal agencies to address the Fourth Circuit concerns and in a manner that will withstand further challenge. That is our highest priority but I think the question that you are raising is one about the longer term implications and I would go to the business case for this investment in answer to that question because the business case remains extraordinarily strong. We need this infrastructure. Eastern North Carolina need this infrastructure, not only for the delivery of natural gas but for continued reduction in carbon emissions as we move away from coal. And so we will continue to pursue ways that we can get that infrastructure into the state but our highest priority and we think the best business case for customers is Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Stephen Byrd : Understood. Thank you very much. Lynn Good : Thank you. Steven Young : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will next go to Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein : Hi. Good morning. Lynn Good : Good morning. Steven Young : Good morning. Michael Weinstein : If you could just talk about the timing of O&M that was mentioned in the quarter? Just wondering what are the issues that were being -- that contributed to different timing of O&M throughout the year? Steven Young : Yes. What I was referring to basically relates to some outages and timing of outages year-over-year. So you will see some non-storm O&M timing that might turn around in the second half of the year. Lynn mentioned storms in the prior year. And if you look at storm O&M in the second half of the year, if we have a more normal second half of the year you might see some favorable O&M coming from that. But some of the non-storm O&M may turn a bit in the second half of the year just because the timing of plant outages and that type of work. So I was just trying to give some flavor for it. We are very pleased with our efforts on O&M in the first half of the year. In response to the mild weather we saw in January and February, we enacted some efforts in our O&M agility, is the term we use internally, to help offset some of the impacts of that. And that's showing up as part of the $0.07 but some of its timing as well. Michael Weinstein : Got it. And on the commercial renewables, you are about 70% line of sight for the five-year plan. Is there a possibility that you might be considering increasing the $2.5 billion investment plan for that segment? Lynn Good : That will be something, Michael, we look at in connection with our five-year planning process, which is underway. But as we think about the five years, given all of the other capital investment opportunities we have, we are really looking for this segment to consistently deliver kind of at the level at that in 2019. And we have a high degree of confidence in its ability to do that because of the 70% that we have already locked in on growth target. So that's probably the way I would think about it at this point. But consistent with five-year planning, we will give every segment a review and make sure it has our best thinking as we come to the street with guidance in February. Michael Weinstein : Got you. And one last question on that on Bloom Energy. How did you guys get involved with fuel cells? Like what was the -- how did that decision process come about, just curious? Lynn Good : Michael, we have a team that is looking at what I would call customer solutions. And so this is a team that works with large industrial, large commercial customers and really is working to customize solutions that those customers need to meet their energy requirements. It can be renewables, it can be battery technology, it can be microgrids, it could be a fuel cell technology. And so the Bloom investment was consistent with the growth priorities that that team is focused on and we believe this notion of customization of energy for large energy users is a trend that will just continue to grow. Michael Weinstein : Great. Thank you very much. Lynn Good : Thank you. Steven Young : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the time. Lynn Good : Hi Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi. Good morning. So Lynn, just going back to some of the comments you made earlier with respect to the coal ash order with the DEQ. Can you elaborate basically the next steps after the Judge's actions recently and just some of the specific nuances of how you go forward on appeals, et cetera? Lynn Good : Sure. Simply put, Julien, we are moving forward on the appeal. And so what we would expect is a procedural calendar to come out establishing discovery and hearings and so on. And so we will continue to challenge the underlying decision itself, the science and engineering, the cost considerations, et cetera. We would expect a hearing to be in 2020 and we will know more as the calendar is established. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Lynn Good : So I think it is a partial dismissal. Yes, partial dismissal. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, absolutely, indeed. And then just if I can turn the focus back to Indiana quickly, you talked about the filing here. Can you elaborate a little bit with respect to the planning process and generation decisions? I know you talked about some acceleration here, but just more of the specifics here? I know the state has got a good bit of attention. So I just want to perhaps dig a little bit. Lynn Good : Julien, the team in Indiana has done a lot of very good work to think about a thoughtful approach around the generation mix in the state. And so we have put together a proposal that shortens the life of certain of the assets and then introduces more investment in renewables and in natural gas which you will see in the IRP plan. So I think the first thing to focus on is the rate case which will run over the next six to nine months. And then the integrated resource plan is something that will continue to be a topic of discussion and review in the state. We believe we have put together a very thoughtful approach. We have had a very active stakeholder engagement not only with customers but with policymakers in the state and believe we have put forward a very thoughtful plan for Indiana. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. But no timeline for further acceleration, right? It still seems like the acceleration is pretty long dated, right, to the remaining asset life? Lynn Good : I think I would ask you to look at it because there is a fair amount acceleration on a couple of the units and then those will be a topic of discussion. Of course, as we go through the rate case and when I say we put together a thoughtful plan, I think that invites and offers an opportunity for further discussion, both with regulators and with other intervening parties. And our commitment is to develop a plan that makes sense for the customers of Indiana but also continues to lower carbon. And we think we have started that conversation well with the rate case and with the IRP. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Thank you very much for the time. Lynn Good : Thank you. Steven Young : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will next go to Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Praful Mehta : Thanks so much. Hi guys. Lynn Good : Good morning. Steven Young : Hello. Praful Mehta : Morning. So a lot of topics covered so far. So I appreciate that. I just wanted to get a little bit more on the North Carolina, the DEQ that you just talked about. The $4 billion to $5 billion spend, if you could dimension for us what the risks are if you are not successful in the appeal in terms of is it all of a customer bill impacts and so that's the worry? Or is there some concern that some part of that $4 billion to $5 billion is not recoverable? Lynn Good : Praful, I would make a couple of comments on that. And the first one is that the impact of the excavation order has a very limited impact on the five-year plan. So $200 million to $400 million falling in that five-year period because of the time required to secure permits and construct landfills and other things contemplated by the order. So we are talking about a period of time that is outside of the five years and with full excavation could extend all the way into the 2040 for certain of the sites. And so I think what it represents is a longer closure period that, in our opinion, increases cost without a measurable improvement in environmental benefits. And that will be the discussion as we go forward. The North Carolina commission has approved recovery of costs for coal ash and so I would ask you to look at that order in terms of the press in the state and we will continue to make progress on these basins. Our commitment and DEQ's is exactly the same, which is to close them safely and that's where our focus remains as we pursue these legal matters and some fine tuning of the approach over the long term to close the basin. Praful Mehta : Got you. Super helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just the same color on the South Carolina side, in terms of appealing the cases there. Could you give us some color on the specific issues that you are more focused on and how you see that playing out? Lynn Good : Sure. In South Carolina, Praful, we are awaiting a final order on the cases. So we have gotten the directive. We have gotten the rehearing. But the actual order on rehearing has not yet been filed. We would expect it in the next period of time and then we have 30 days to appeal the order which we intend to do and we would appeal to the Supreme Court in South Carolina. The disallowance of coal ash costs will be a part of that appeal. And I think it's important to recognize that the precedent between North and South Carolina is a long-standing one where the benefits between the two states are shared on generation and transmission. And remediation of coal ash would be a part of the decommissioning of plants. And these plants that then share the benefits of those plants with South Carolina customers over their entire life. I think it's also important to recognize that both the federal and the state laws establish safe basin closure methods and excavation is an option in both. And so we would intend to continue to pursue this. I think the timeframe you should think about is probably one to two years to work through the process. But the cost doesn't start until we get the order and then file the appeal within 30 days. So we will continue to keep you posted as it moves through the process. Praful Mehta : Got you. Thank you. And then just finally in terms of, clearly you are having a strong first half. Is there any assumption on incremental O&M being pulled forward, given you have some budget or some room in your numbers to kind of maintain within the guidance? I just wanted to understand kind of any shipping on the O&M side for the second half? Steven Young : Well, Praful, that capability to move O&M back and forth and toggle it based upon results is a core skill set that we have. It remains to be seen in the second half of the year dependent upon weather, storm activity and those kind of things whether we will pull those levers. But I mentioned, we pulled some of them in response to the mild weather in the first couple of months of the year. We have the capability of redirecting O&M in different fashion when we see favorable results as well. But I don't want to give any firm guidance going forward. We still have got the third quarter to go and the weather and storm sit in front of us. But we do have that capability. Lynn Good : And Praful, the objective of all of this is to deliver on our commitments around the guidance that we have provided for the street and that's the way we will approach this. Praful Mehta : Understood. Thanks so much guys and congratulations. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Michael Lapides : Hi guys. Lynn Good : Hi Michael. Michael Lapides : Hi Lynn. I wanted to ask about North Carolina renewables. And can you remind us, A, what's already in your forecast for the amount of renewables you are building in North Carolina where you have already got approval through the RFP process? And then, can you remind us what the limits are and how much you think you could wind up doing beyond what's already known or in your plan? Steven Young : Yes, Michael, I will take that. And regarding the limits to the HB589 regulations, there is a limit to our bidding and winning bids to 30% of the tranches that are going to be bid over the next several years. There is no limit to subsequent acquisition of another winning bidder's part interest. So ultimately we could own a higher percentage than 30% of the renewables assets from HB589. I think for planning purposes, we have got about 30% in our plan. We have typically thought about that being in the commercial renewables segment. But it could be within the regulated business segment or the commercial renewables. The first tranche that was awarded of roughly 600 megawatts between regulated and commercial, we got about a third of that. So I think that's a reasonable planning assumption going forward. Michael Lapides : So roughly a couple hundred megawatts a year installed run rate? Or is that a couple hundred megawatts over a several year period? Steven Young : It will depend upon how much is bid through the process. We saw 600 megawatts. Initially it was 680 megawatts, but only 600 was awarded. If the tranches stayed at that level then it might be in the ballpark of 150 to 200 megawatts. The tranches going forward may be smaller than that as we grandfather other renewables into the process. But you can think about those numbers as a reasonable number to think about. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you. much appreciated. Lynn Good : Thank you Michael. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Sophie Karp : Hi. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Lynn Good : Hi Sophie. Steven Young : Thank you. Sophie Karp : I wanted to also a question on renewables and maybe from an angle that has clearly been a very successful program for you and an attractive niche. Is there a way to do more along those lines in addition to these tranches, maybe just those strictly in the commercial renewable space? And what's your view the probability that we are going to see some ITC and PTC extension? Steven Young : A couple of things here. On the tranches of renewables that come through the HB589, we will continue to participate at that level. We think it makes sense. We know the service area. We know the grid surrounding of these assets. So again, I think that it will continue to be fruitful for us over the next several years. Regarding ITC and PTC extensions, again, we have heard nothing about extending that specifically. They are set to expire and that is what we are basing our plans upon is that those particular tax benefits will begin to wind down. Lynn Good : And Sophie, we commented a moment ago on the strength of the pipeline that sits in the commercial business. We feel very confident with our ability to deliver within our five-year plan and have a robust pipeline to support that. I think in terms of the Congressional extension of the credits, there is some discussion underway about that. We have been supporters of Congress' bipartisan agreement to fade them down. We believe that the economic competitiveness of the resource is very attractive and as a result are supportive of that fade down. But I think we will have to see what plays outs as the process continues in Washington. Sophie Karp : Got you. Thank you. And then maybe, if I may, a quick follow-up on the coal ash in South Carolina. So your appeal right now is to the State Supreme Court, correct? Lynn Good : Yes. Sophie Karp : But ultimately, the issue is how these costs would be allocated between two different states? And should we expect this litigation ultimately find its way to the federal court? Lynn Good : I believe the South Carolina Supreme Court is where it will be decided, Sophie. And there is a great deal of precedent over decades around the allocation of costs between North and South Carolina. We run the generation and transmission system as a system between North and South Carolina and have very established methods of allocating costs. And so we will be presenting very strong arguments on those costs and believe that it will be resolved at the Supreme Court level in South Carolina. Sophie Karp : Got it. Thank you very much. Very helpful color. Lynn Good : Thank you Sophie. Steven Young : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks. Lynn Good : Well, thank you everyone. We appreciate your interest and investment in Duke Energy. Our IR team will be available this afternoon as usual to answer any follow-up questions and we look forward to seeing many of you in the weeks to come. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And with that, that does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to the Duke Energy Third Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bryan Buckler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Bryan Buckler : Thank you, Derek. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining Duke Energy's third quarter 2019 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President and CEO; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's discussion will include forward-looking information and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. Slide 2 presents the safe harbor statement, which accompanies our presentation materials. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found on duke-energy.com and in today's materials. Please note, the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. As summarized on Slide 3, during today's call, Lynn will provide an update on the quarter and progress on our strategic initiatives. Steve will then provide an overview of third quarter financial results and insight about economic and load growth trends. He will also provide an update on our regulatory and financing activities this year before closing with key investor considerations. With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Bryan, thank you and good morning everyone. Today we announced strong results for the quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.79 compared to $1.65 in the prior-year. This represents 7% growth through the first three quarters, giving us confidence that we will look to the rest of the year. We have narrowed our 2019 EPS guidance range to $4.95 to $5.15 raising the midpoint into the upper half of our original range. We also reaffirmed our long-term earnings growth rate of 4% to 6% through 2023 of the midpoint of our original 2019 guidance range. 2019 is proven to be a solid year of growth for Duke Energy as we transform the customer experience and deliver value for our shareholders. We continue executing our strategy, making significant investments in the energy grid, cleaner generation and natural gas infrastructure and the fundamentals of our business remain strong. Let me highlight several operational accomplishments in the quarter on Slide 4. First in early September, Hurricane Dorian, a historic Category 5 storm with an unpredictable path devastated the Bahamas before sweeping across the East Coast. Our thoughts remain with the people of the Bahamas as they continue the long journey to rebuild their communities and the days leading up to Dorian\u2019s potential landfall are weather forecasts and models projected significant outages to our Florida and Carolinas service territories. In response, we mobilized nearly 8,000 resources in Florida and over 10,000 resources in the Carolinas as we braced for the storm. While Dorian\u2019s track shifted, it caused nearly 300,000 outages in our service territories, our teams preparation, commitment to our customers and focus on our operational excellence enabled us to restore more than 95% of the outages within 24 hours. Also, our systems and employees performed well in the face of some of the hottest days on record in September and early October. Despite these temperatures, our fleet performed well and serves customers with the energy they demand. In the quarter, Duke Energy was named one of the top sustainable companies in North America by Dow Jones for the 14th consecutive year. This is a testament to our climate strategy, sustainable practices and ongoing investments and cleaner generation. In addition, Duke Energy received the U.S. Transparency award, which recognizes the quality and transparency of information the U.S. companies make available to investors. Duke Energy was awarded Best Corporate Disclosure for the utility industry. I'm proud of our employees and our operational execution during the quarter from storm preparation to industry recognitions, we continue to demonstrate the strength of our business and excel in our operations, which is fundamental to achieving our long-term strategy. Turning to Slide 5 in September, we announced a more aggressive comprehensive strategy to reduce carbon emissions. By 2030, we will cut carbon emissions by at least 50% from 2005 levels, and aspire to attain net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Our commitment for 2030 includes plant retirement, operating our existing carbon free resources, and investing in natural gas infrastructure, renewables and our energy delivery system. Our recent rate case filings in Indiana and the Carolinas are consistent with this accelerated approach. As we look beyond 2030, we will need additional tools to continue our progress. We will work actively to advocate for research and development of carbon-free dispatchable resources that includes longer-term energy storage, advanced nuclear technologies, carbon capture, and zero carbon fuels. We will also pursue second license renewal for all of our nuclear assets to maintain this low cost, carbon-free source of generation. The journey and timeline for achieving our targets will be different in each state. And we're committed to working with our regulators and other stakeholders to design the right path for our customers and communities. Making our energy system cleaner and more sustainable means, we must transform the way we operate. And we're facing that challenge head on. We've made great progress and our acceleration in this area will position the company to provide customers with a cleaner, smarter energy future. The investments shown on Slide 6 are also consistent with our climate strategy. Our Ashville combined cycle plan is on track to be completed by the end of the year. This plant is part of our $1.1 billion Western Carolinas modernization project that supports this growing region. Also in North Carolina the second renewable energy RFP under House Bill 589 launched in mid-October. The RFP seeks another 680 megawatts of solar projects, which would bring the total renewables under the program to almost 1,200 megawatts. We look forward to participating in this next phase of the process. As a reminder, in Florida, we will be installing 700 megawatts of solar by 2022 as part of our multi-year settlement agreement. Today, the Commission has improved the recovery of 344 megawatts under the solar base rate adjustment mechanisms. Focusing on our commercial renewables business, we had another impressive quarter. So far this year, we've announced over 1,500 megawatts of new wind and solar projects, including nearly 400 megawatts announced in the third quarter. Given our pipeline of investments, we have line of sight nearly all of our growth prospects for 2019 and 2020 and 70% over the five-year plan. Shifting to our gas business on Slide 7, let me update you on the status of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. In early October, the U.S. Supreme Court accepted our petition to review the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals Appalachian Trail crossing decision. This is a very encouraging sign and provides the path forward to resolve this important issue. We expect the Supreme Court will schedule arguments for early next year, with a final decision no later than mid-2020. As a reminder, the Solicitor General has joined our appeal, and we are supported by a broad coalition of stakeholders including 16 State Attorneys General, we believe the law in fact are on our side and look forward to moving toward a final resolution. We also continue to work with project partners and the Fish and Wildlife Service on the biological opinion, an incidental take statement to resolve the issues identified by the Fourth Circuit. Based on early discussions, we now expect the permits to be issued in the first half of 2020. While this is later than previously anticipated, all parties are keenly focused on delivering reissue permits that are robust enough to minimize the potential for further appeal. This timing also aligns more closely with the expected Supreme Court decision providing more clarity before we pursue full construction activities. Given this timeline for the resolution of the Appalachian Trail Crossing and the biological opinion, we are no longer pursuing a phased approach, but are now planning for mechanical completion of the project in late 2021 with full-in service in the first half of 2022. On the customer front, the ACP project partners have advanced discussions on the project status and costs and we expect to reach an agreement in principle by the end of this year balancing price and project returns. We believe this pipeline remains the best option to meet our customers needs. We remain committed to the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the significant benefits that will bring to our customers and our region. It will provide much needed natural gas to an underserved area of the Southeast and will allow us to retire coal units and replace them with cleaner burning natural gas fired plants to help meet our carbon reduction targets. In addition, it supports critical resiliency need for some of the country's most important military outposts. At the same time, as we execute on our $37 billion growth capital plan that underlies our 4% to 6% earnings growth rate, we have consistently stated our commitment to a strong balance sheet. Given ACP progress and clarity on important milestones, which includes the delay in project revenues until early to mid-2022, we are increasing the amount of equity in our plan. We plan to monitor market conditions and issue approximately $2.5 billion opportunistically by the end of 2020. This additional equity allows us to absorb a wide range of outcomes associated with ACP, while also offering greater financial flexibility to the company. For instance, after ACP comes online, we will have the ability to moderate our current assumptions of $500 million per year in DRIP and ATM issuances. Additionally, we see emerging infrastructure needs for our expansive energy delivery system, which may require incremental investments in which would drive additional growth beyond our existing $37 billion growth capital plan. We believe this issuance keeps us moving forward as we deliver value to our customers and results for our shareholders. We remain confident in our ability to achieve 4% to 6% earnings growth through 2023 given our healthy franchises and strong investment growth profile. Steve will discuss more details about our growth drivers in a moment. Circling back to ACP, I'm pleased with the progress we've made to advance this important infrastructure project. While this is a lengthy process we're committed to the project and its completion and we will continue to share details as we learn more. Moving to Slide 8, let me share a few updates about recent legislative developments. Earlier this week, Senate Bill 559 was enacted into law in North Carolina, enabling the Utilities Commission to approve storm costs securitization. This important mechanism will save customers 15% to 20% on storm costs and support our balance sheet. We\u2019re pleased with the General Assembly's unanimous vote on securitization, and also the bipartisan support for other costs recovery mechanisms that we advocated for, such as multi-year rate plans and ROE band. While the final bill does not include these other provisions, Governor Cooper's Clean Energy Plan speaks to the potential for modernized recovery mechanisms for the State, we are encouraged that these important reforms are part of the broader energy policy dialog, and we will actively participate in the 2020 stakeholder engagement process related to the Clean Energy Plan. Changes to the regulatory construct are a vital part of achieving North Carolina's energy objectives in the long-term. We are focused on advancing modern mechanisms and the customer benefits they provide. In the near-term, our attention will be on the execution of frequent rate cases and pursuing solutions to reduce regulatory lag. Both are important to delivering customer benefits and meeting our earnings objectives. We have operated in North Carolina for more than a century providing our customers with safe and reliable power. The state is thriving with a strong economy and increasing demand for new energy infrastructure. As we look ahead, we share many of the state's objectives and will partner with stakeholders to develop innovative solutions and thoughtful energy policy. Energy policy discussions are also advancing in many of our other states and stakeholders are embracing the value of improving the grid. In Ohio, Health Bill 247 is progressing through the legislature. This bill would further grid modernization distributed generation and other investments to benefit customers. And in Florida, recently enacted legislation promotes grid hardening investment that will improve the resiliency of the grid against extreme weather events, while establishing rider recovery for the investments. The Florida Public Service Commission is finalizing rulemaking and we expect to file our storm protection plan in 2020. With over 300,000 line miles across our utilities, our transmission and distribution network is the largest in the nation, and the demands in our energy delivery system have never been greater. This requires significant capital investment to ensure our communities keep pace with the energy transformation occurring across the nation. We\u2019re excited to work with stakeholders across all of our electric and gas service territories to ensure the pace and scale of our investments align with customer needs. Before turning it over to Steve, I want to reiterate our strong confidence in our long-term strategy and our continued ability to deliver on our commitments. We're taking necessary steps to maintain the strength of our balance sheet advocating for solutions across our jurisdictions and making progress as we advance our investment priorities to benefit our customers and shareholders. As we move into the fourth quarter, we look forward to closing out a very strong year. With that, I'll turn it over to Steve. Steven Young : Thanks, Lynn and good morning, everyone. I'll start with quarterly results on Slide 9, including our adjusted earnings per share variances to the prior-year. For detailed information on variance drivers and a reconciliation of reported to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. On a reported basis, 2019 third quarter earnings per share were $1.82 compared to a $1.51 last year. Third quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share were $1.79 compared to $1.65 last year. The difference between 2019 reported and adjusted earnings was due to a reduction in an open impairment charge originally recorded in 2018. This benefit has been reflected as a special item and excluded from adjusted earnings. For the quarter, higher adjusted results compared to the prior-year were primarily due to growth from investments at the electric and gas utilities, favorable weather and lower O&M expenses. These items were partially offset by higher financing costs. Within the segments, electric utilities and infrastructure was up $0.25 compared to the prior-year. Higher results were driven by base rate increases across multiple utilities, more favorable weather and higher rider revenues, including recovery of our Midwest grid investments. O&M was also favorable in the quarter. During September, Hurricane Dorian impacted our Florida and Carolinas utilities. We estimate total cost for Hurricane Dorian as approximately $400 million, including $150 million in Florida. We deferred the majority of these costs and we request recovery through regulatory proceedings at DEP and DEF in the coming months. Similar to previous hurricane costs, such as Florence, a portion of the Dorian costs are not eligible for recovery. While Hurricane Dorian restoration costs impacted our quarterly results, we incurred higher costs in the third quarter of 2018 for a net favorable effect this quarter. We also continue to excel at controlling traditional O&M costs, exceeding our own targeted savings for the quarter. While we expect some of the O&M favorability to turn in the fourth quarter due to timing, it is clear our digital and efficiency efforts are producing real savings. I will speak more about our capabilities in this area in a moment. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher depreciation from a growing asset base and slightly lower retail volumes. Shifting to gas utilities and infrastructure, results were up $0.01 in the quarter, largely due to growth from our Midstream investments. While we did see growth in our LDC businesses from an increase in customers, we expect these businesses to have a strong earnings contribution in the fourth quarter due to seasonality. In commercial renewable, results were up $0.02 driven by favorable wind resource and growth from our new projects. The other segment was down $0.11 for the quarter, largely due to higher financing costs and timing of income tax expense recognition in the current year. We continue to expect our full-year 2019 adjusted effective tax rate to be between 12% and 14%. Finally, share dilution drove a $0.03 decline given we issued shares in December to settle last year's equity forward agreements. We are very pleased with our results so far this year delivering 7% growth on a year-to-date basis. This execution gives us confidence that we will achieve full-year results within our narrowed 2019 earnings per share guidance range of $4.95 to $5.15. Turning into Slide 10, we operate in jurisdictions with strong customer and business growth fueled by steady population migration. In the third quarter, we saw a pause in the volume growth we experienced in recent quarters, driven primarily by the industrial sector. On a rolling 12-month basis, weather normalized retail electric load growth was negative 0.5%. Within the residential class, we continue to experience outstanding customer growth in each of our territories with an overall increase of 1.6% in 2019. Company sponsored energy efficiency programs for which we are compensated have contributed to the decline in recent residential usage per customer. Residential results in the quarter were also likely impacted by Hurricane Dorian. These factors together resulted in relatively flat residential volumes for the rolling 12-month period. In the commercial class, sales were down 0.6% over the rolling 12-months. Results were impacted by greater adoption of our energy efficiency programs and Big Box retail closures. These were partially offset by an uptick in data center expansions and strength in the medical services segment. Finally, sales in our industrial class declined 1.3% on a rolling 12-month basis. Lower industrial volumes were driven by manufacturing contractions and the weakening global economy. A few singular industrial closings and manufacturing outages further influenced the rolling 12-month average. We believe these specific outliers will improve as we move forward. Overall, our strong customer growth attractive jurisdictions and business diversity up to mitigate broader macroeconomic headwinds. We expect to end the year flat to last year and recall this follows growth in 2018 of almost 1%, we\u2019ll continue to monitor economic trends and impacts on our sales volumes and will provide updates on our February call. Turning to Slide 11, let me update you on our active regulatory calendar. We filed rate cases for DEC and DEP in North Carolina in September and October respectively. We are seeking recovery for investments in cleaner generation infrastructure, grid modernization projects and accelerated depreciation of certain coal units. We request also include recovery of coal ash remediation spend and deferred storm costs. Now that the storm securitization bill is law, we will seek to securitize the North Carolina portion of these costs, which will reduce the rate impact to our customers. Both cases proposed a 10.3% ROE and 53% equity component of the capital structure. Evidentiary hearings for the DEC case are set to begin in March 2020. We expect revised rates for both DEC and DEP to be effective in the third quarter 2020. Moving to Piedmont Natural Gas, we\u2019re pleased with the outcome of the settlement in the North Carolina rate case which was approved on October 31. Under the agreement, Piedmont is allowed a 9.7% ROE and 52% equity capital structure. Piedmont also received approval of a 9.9% ROE and 55% equity capital structure in their recent South Carolina annual regulatory filing. Turning to our other utilities, we continue to work through rate case proceedings at Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Kentucky with hearings expected in the first quarter of 2020 in both cases, we have a robust regulatory strategy that has enabled us to consistently secure recovery of investments we make on behalf of our customers. Our regulators understand the importance of the work we do to serve our communities while also maintaining healthy utilities in their regions. We will continue this important work as we close out 2019 and move into 2020. Shifting to Slide 12, our strategy is focused on delivering value to customers through investments, in clean energy, natural gas and grid infrastructure underscored by a $37 billion growth capital plan through 2023. As Lynn mentioned, and as we have previously emphasized, we are committed to maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and are taking proactive steps to ensure our credit metrics remain strong. With ACP\u2019s projected revenues delayed until 2022, we intend to issue approximately $2.5 billion of equity by the end of 2020. This will align proceeds with the timing of ACP construction activities and help avoid unnecessary dilution in 2020. In 2021 and 2022, dilution will be offset by increased ACP earnings given we are no longer pursuing a phase-in approach, AFUDC will accrue on the entire balance until full commissioning occurs, providing an earnings uplift during construction. This additional equity strengthens the company's credit profile, provide sufficient balance sheet strength to absorb a wide range of outcomes associated with ACP. We continue to expect equity issuances of $500 million per year through 2022 via the DRIP and ATM programs for a total of approximately $4 billion of equity issuances over this three-year period, compared to our previous plans of $1.5 billion during this time period. However, after ACP comes on law, this additional equity will provide us the balance sheet flexibility to moderate or eliminate annual equity issuances, or deploy additional capital towards regulated investments. Let's turn to Slide 13 where I'd like to highlight approximately 5.5% growth we've seen in our core electric and gas segments this year, which includes financing costs at the holding company. This is on top of the adjusted 5.5% growth we saw for these businesses in 2018 versus 2017. These results have been driven by execution on our $37 billion growth capital plan and top notch O&M cost control efforts, highlighting the outstanding electric and gas service territories in which we operate and giving us great confidence as we look to 2020 and beyond. With that, let's move to Slide 14 to discuss primary growth drivers for next year. I'll start with 2020 drivers in the Electric Utilities segment. In Florida, we will continue to recover our grid investments through the second base rate increase in our multi-year rate plan. We also expect growth from additional solar projects we covered under the solar base rate adjustment mechanism. In the Carolinas, we have a full-year of benefit of the South Carolina rate increases that went into effect in June, we\u2019ll have partial years contribution from the North Carolina rate cases filed this year as well as increased wholesale earnings due to improved pricing. In the Midwest, we\u2019ll see the impacts of our Indiana and Kentucky rate cases and will continue to invest in transmission and distribution upgrades that are recovered under our rider programs. Shifting to the gas segment, we will see higher AFUDC earnings from ACP given we expect construction activities to resume in 2020, once key permits are reissued. The LDC business will see growth from Piedmont\u2019s rate cases, customer additions and continued investments in integrity management and power generation infrastructure. Our commercial renewable segment will be largely flat to 2019. But as Lynn mentioned, we have line of sight substantially all our growth prospects for 2020 and 70% over the five-year plan. In addition to a long utility driven runway for investment, our demonstrated cost control capabilities will remain an important tool to achieve our growth objectives. Our track record of cost management has been outstanding. Since 2015, we have actually lowered non-recoverable O&M from $4.9 billion to $4.8 billion. This includes absorbing $300 million of O&M from the Piedmont acquisition in 2016 in addition to offsetting wage and salary increases in general inflation. In 2019, we continue to take advantage of our scope and scale by investing in digital capabilities and data analytics, which are creating sustainable cost savings. For example, we established an IDEA Lab earlier this year, we have nearly 400 people at this facility who are dedicated to developing digital applications and other solutions to benefit operations every day. In less than a year, they have put more than 20 applications into the field. We know these capabilities will serve us well over our long-term planning horizon. Beyond 2020, we expect dilution from the $2.5 billion equity issuance to occur beginning in 2021. This will be offset by increased eight ACP earnings. We are no longer pursuing a phase-in approach and therefore AFUDC will improve on the entire balance throughout the construction period, providing an earnings uplift in 2021 and 2022. Many of the drivers, I just described will also support earnings growth in 2021, such as the Florida multi-year rate plan and SOBRA investments. Full-year rate case impacts in North Carolina, Indiana and Kentucky, as well as continued grid investments in the Midwest utilities. Longer-term, we expect significant investment opportunity from storm hardening legislation and solar demand in Florida, the growing need for cleaner generation and energy delivery infrastructure in the Carolinas and new gas distribution infrastructure across our footprint. These drivers give us confidence in our 4% to 6% earnings per share growth rate through 2023. Consistent with our historical practice, we will provide 2020 earnings guidance and our growth prospects for future years during our February financial update. I'll close with Slide 15, we are having a fantastic 2019 is illustrated by another strong quarter. The fundamentals of our business remain strong as those are attractive investor value proposition that is founded upon our growing dividend which currently yields 4%. Coupled with earnings growth of 4% to 6% from transparent, low risk investments, we offer a compelling risk adjusted total shareholder return of 8% to 10%. Our scale constructive service areas and ability to execute make Duke Energy a solid long-term investment opportunity. With that, let's open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay, good morning guys. Lynn Good : Hi, Shar. Steven Young : Good morning. Shahriar Pourreza : Just on the - couple questions here. On the equity that was just announced, curious on your thoughts on the timing, especially without knowing the viability of ACP. So can you run into a situation where you issue or commit to the equity and SCOTUS to further appeal somehow deal a blow to the project. Do you sort of need the equity if ACP is ultimately cancelled? And then I'm just curious on how Steve you're thinking about the method on the equity hybrid,  convertible, forwards? Lynn Good : And Shar, I will take that. I think this has been a journey on this project, as you know. And we really looked at the progress made in this quarter that provided us some clarity on a couple of important milestones. So certainly SCOTUS taking the case was important for us to have greater confidence and getting over the trail. And then the fact that we've continued discussions on the biological opinion, discussions with our customers and contractors, all of that taken together, we concluded that targeting a single in-service date at the end of 2021 with completion, mechanical completion in 2021, full-completion in 2022 was the right approach, balancing customer benefits, construction efficiencies and all of those things and so as we reach those milestones, we thought looking at financing was also appropriate. And as we looked at financing, we did consider a range of outcomes on this project. We\u2019re committed to completing the project. But I think the fact that we have had challenges along the way makes us clear eyed about evaluating the range of outcomes. We also believe this approach supports the $37 billion capital we're funding in the rest of our regulated business. And with getting the equity out there, we do have flexibility with our DRIP and ATM in the future, if circumstances indicate that we could moderate that and we have additional investments that we could put forward. So we thought it was appropriate in light of the events that occurred this quarter, Shar to de-risk our plan, get the balance sheet in good shape, move forward, as we have said on Atlantic Coast pipeline, and really feel like the plan itself is a solid one that represents good growth for investors. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. So with or without -- sorry, sorry, please go ahead. Steven Young : I was just going to say regarding the mechanism, we've got plenty of time to do this equity. So there are as you mentioned, a number of tools out there we will be looking at that and seeing what makes the most sense for us, but nothing further beyond that at this point. Shahriar Pourreza : So with our without ACP, the capital program, you have necessitates the needs for equity, with or without ACP, I think? Lynn Good : Shar, what I would say is we have already invested almost $2 billion in ACP. And we are continuing to advance the project in light of the developments that have occurred. And so this equity is really to strengthen the balance sheet through that construction period, also supporting the capital growth. And we do have ability to the DRIP, DRIP and ATM to moderate if we think that makes sense in the future. But we were -- we thought it was appropriate to look at financing and de-risk the balance Sheet at this stage in light of the progress that we've made. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. And then just lastly on Senate Bill 559, obviously as you highlighted, it\u2019s signed into law but it was obviously missing the key piece of the proposal around multi-year planning, ROE band, et cetera. Curious on why this was removed, especially given the Governor's kind of Clean Energy Plan, which was submitted earlier this year and included the possibilities of these mechanisms. So he obviously understands the importance. So I'm curious why that ultimately was removed. And I have to envision the stakeholder process in the Governor's Clean Energy Plan is going to be much more involved. So if you can give us a little bit of a sense on timing, that would be great. Lynn Good : Appreciate that, Shar. And I think the fact that the Clean Energy Plan gives recognition to regulatory modernization is a good thing. But the clean energy plan also includes carbon reductions of up to 70%, of greenhouse gas emission reductions up to 70% also talks about retirement of uneconomic coal plant, grid support for clean energy. So it does bring in a number of other topics. And I think the spirit of the stakeholder process will be to address not only the modernized regulatory construct, but some of these other items. And as we look at the plan, in light of our climate strategy, we see a great deal of alignment on how we would like to go forward and believe will be an important part of delivering the solutions that the Governor lays out in the clean energy plan. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Thanks guys. I'll jump back in. Thank you so much. Lynn Good : Thank you, Shar. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Weinstein : Hi Lynn and Steve. Lynn Good : Hi Michael. Michael Weinstein : Okay. Hey can you eliminate further on reasons for delays at U.S. Fish and Wildlife into the first half of 2020, do this and does the move away from a phase-in approach simply mean that there's just no appetite among off takers for that Phase 1 alternative that had been discussed previously? Lynn Good : Let me take that in two parts, Michael. So the discussions are underway with Fish and Wildlife. We are taking a look at all of the feedback from the Fourth Circuit evaluating next step. There's been extensive work done as you know, additional surveys of the Bumblebee and the Clubshell Mussel and the intent of all of the parties is to address those concerns in a way that reduces any additional risks associated with remand from that permit. So we believe it could be issued ss early as wintertime, we keep our eye on that tree-clearing window as you know, to try to get trees cleared if we can before the 1st of March. But given our timeline with the Appalachian Trail, we can also accommodate slipping a little further in 2020. I think in terms of the phased-in approach, we have continued discussion throughout this project with customers and also monitoring all of the developments that have occurred, including these permit challenges, et cetera and the greatest value for our customers is the complete project because they're trying to get to that supply basin, and also infrastructure diversity and to the Eastern part of the state. And so that single project is where our customers see the greatest value. And I also believe with our timing that the construction efficiencies of building it in a single phase also make a great deal of sense. So we've got some alignment, and with that movement to revenue in 2022, that was a driver as well as we thought about our financing plan. Michael Weinstein : Got you. And one last one, has there been any change to the approximate 2% dividend growth expectation? I know you have a commitment to dividend growth. But just wondering if this equity issuance makes any change to that? Lynn Good : Michael, we will reevaluate in connection with guidance in February. But I think that's a reasonable planning assumption for now. We see that as an opportunity and a way for us to moderate our payout ratio to be more in line with our industry peers. And the combination of all these things puts us in a very strong position to execute our growth plans. Michael Weinstein : Okay, thank you very much. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next go to the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Greg Gordon : Thanks. Good morning. Steven Young : Good morning. Lynn Good : Good morning. Greg Gordon : Congrats on having a really strong year this year. Lynn Good : Thank you, Greg. Greg Gordon : As it pertains to ACP, with the phased-in, with the lack of a phased-in approach, you would be booking the full AFUDC rate until the project goes into service, so I can see how that has an accretive effect to earnings in 2021 and sort of as an offset to the increased share count. But when it goes into service and you start collecting the actual cash revenues based on the current contract rate, given that the project is coming in at $7.5 billion when the initial service costs was estimated to be in the mid-5s, not that you're alone, there's lots of pipes that are having this issue, shouldn't the return on the pipe unless you're able to negotiate some pass-through of those cost overruns go, that the cash earnings will be lower than the AFUDC rate unless you were able to get contract relief. Is that the right assumption? Lynn Good : Greg, I think it's important to recognize that we had been in conversations with customers all along the way on the status of the project and also the cost. And we do expect to reach an agreement in principle by the end of this year that provides the right balance between customer price and returns. So we have said a number of times that the actual executed return on this project will be a regulated like return and we believe that continues to be a fair planning assumption. I think the AFUDC rate is higher about 14%. But we believe the in-service rate will be a very good regulated return. Greg Gordon : Okay, so you believe you'll be able to negotiate a balanced outcome where the aftertax ROE on the pipe on the current, on the new construction cost will look like a good regulated return? Lynn Good : I think it's -- it'll be a balanced outcome. And Greg, the business case for this pipe has remained unchanged. If I look at it from the perspective of Duke Energy, the need for additional firm transport into the Carolinas is unchanged and increasing as time continues. And so this pipe in its entirety represents an extraordinary opportunity for us to position the Southeast for decades to come and our customers recognize that and the same as the case in Virginia and that Eastern part of Virginia. So I think what often gets overlooked is that there's a fundamental need for this pipe because of the demand in the region. Greg Gordon : No doubt about that. Thank you, Lynn. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we will next go to Christopher Turnure with JPMorgan. Christopher Turnure : Good morning, Lynn and Steve. Lynn Good : Good morning. Steven Young : Good morning, Chris. Christopher Turnure : Obviously, the markets are doing well and utilities are doing well in terms of stock price performance. I'm wondering if part of your plans included evaluating asset sales in lieu of doing equity. And then, I guess, tied to that question, is part of your decision to do this size of equity tied to the strong market performance? Lynn Good : Yes, Chris, it's a good question. And from our history, we have monetized assets over time, including as recently as a joint venture partner into our commercial renewables business. So we have evaluated that. We believe that our portfolio, we like our portfolio, it's delivering value, it's growing, we have great investment opportunities. So our intent is to pursue this equity need through a security through the markets as opposed to an asset disposition. And so we'll evaluate the timing opportunistically as Steve mentioned, and believe that\u2019s going to position the company well for growth in the future. Christopher Turnure : Okay. And then is it fair on the equity issuance to assume that the full amount of the $2-plus billion would hit your share count by the end of next year through cost infrastructure or others? Steven Young : Yes, that\u2019s correct. Lynn Good : Yes, that\u2019s fair planning assumption. Christopher Turnure : Okay. And then, Lynn, you started to address this in a prior question, but just the Governor's plan in North Carolina, kind of what it means for the future, seems like it's a good thing for you guys and your ability to invest in the state and further the goals there. But is there any more detail that you can provide us on next steps and your efforts to get lower regulatory lag and more visibility into your regulatory recovery? Lynn Good : Sure. And I guess I\u2019ll take that in two ways. Chris, on regulatory lag, we have that assignment regardless of what happens to the clean energy plan and we\u2019ll accomplish through deferrals, through capital optimization, through timing our rate case as well and you can expect us to continue to focus on that very keenly. But as it pertains to the clean energy plan, early discussions are already underway. The Department of Environmental Quality in the state is overseeing this process, we would expect stakeholder workshop to kick-off even as early as the end of this year, but continuing into 2020. And there were probably a half dozen stakeholder processes during the course of 2019 in preparation for the issuance of the plan. So it's already building some momentum. And as you noted, and as I said, we see a lot of alignment between our climate strategy and what the Governor is trying to accomplish. And I've looked at where we are in North Carolina with over 30% reduction in carbon emissions already close to 35%. Our IRP plan puts us between 50% and 55% already by 2030. North Carolina is second in the nation in installed solar capacity, over 50% of the energy comes from carbon free sources. We're looking to second license renewal on nuclear. So there are a number of strategic things that I think line up well with us and so we\u2019ll be very interested in continuing that discussion in 2020 with the clean energy plan stakeholder process. Christopher Turnure : Okay. Is there a point in time at which those stakeholder discussions move to the Utility Commission? Or is that kind of too far out to tell? Lynn Good : I think it\u2019s too far out to tell. Chris, I do think just getting back to part of it. So we have in front of the commission right now accelerated retirements of coal in connection with our rate case. So we'll have an opportunity to advance that discussion. It's consistent with the clean energy plan over the course of our rate case, and you can expect to see testimony along those lines. So there will be advances consistent with that plan during 2020. I will of course keep you informed about the stakeholder process as it unfolds. Christopher Turnure : Okay, great. Thanks Lynn. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman : Yes, hey good morning, Lynn. Lynn Good : Hi Steve. Steve Fleishman : Hi, so just could you just remind us the commercial renewables business, just given the increase projects you've had there, how much you're going to end-up investing in that business, roughly this year and maybe next year? Lynn Good : Steve will take that. StevenYoung: Yes, Steve. I think will be in the range of $1 billion this year. It'll be lesser amounts as we go forward, still in line with the five-year plan of roughly $2.5 billion investments or about $1 billion this year. Steve Fleishman : Okay, okay and then switching back to kind of the news today on the equity and the like, so just maybe trying to ignore the exact timing by year but just overall if we still have ACP coming on, which was in the before. But there is now $2.5 billion of additional equity. Can you just maybe better explain how that still keep you in the same growth like what else is an offset? Is it just better performance in some of the other businesses? Lynn Good : Steve, I think we should take that kind of break that down a little bit. So let's talk about the construction period of ACP. We have moved away from the phased-in approach with a plan now for the project to go into mechanical completion in 2021, full-in service in 2022. So with this change, we will be accruing allowance for funds for a longer period of time on the full project than what we had previously considered, where we were putting part of the 60% or so of the project in service at the end of 2020 and then the rest in service at the end of 2021. So that gives us additional earnings during the construction period, that will offset dilution from the equity. And then as we go post in-service, we are working actively with customers, as I said a moment ago to reach agreement, we believe in principle by the end of the year to find a balance between construction costs and returns on the project that would be consistent with revenues that would come into service in 2022. And then I think Steve, kind of outlined on Slide 14 of the deck, a very comprehensive set of drivers that are driving growth in the regulated businesses and I believe we have consistently delivered within our growth range on the regulated businesses and we see even more potential with the Florida legislation, with the Ohio legislation, with the clean energy plan being outlined in the Carolinas. And so as we come to the Street in February, we\u2019ll be giving you some more visibility and where we see additional growth. And we think the combination of all of these things give us confidence that we can remain within the range of 4% to 6% of our planning period. Steve Fleishman : Okay, I think I got it, thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll next go to Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Praful Mehta : Thanks so much, hi guys. Lynn Good : Good morning. Praful Mehta : Good morning. So maybe coming back to the equity but looking at it more from the credit side, it seems like there's a little bit of surprise around the need of equity. And it seems to be stemming more from a credit pressure that you're seeing potentially from the agencies, you had a sale earlier in the year. Now you're doing more equity, even despite sounds like where ACP goes from a timing perspective. So just wanted to understand, so we have a better kind of framework. What is the credit situation right now? What are the rating agencies saying? I mean, is there like a minimum threshold you're trying to hit, just so we get, what's driving the fundamental equity need? Lynn Good : And Praful, I'll try to do it and Steve can chime in as well. I think it's important to focus on cash flow and when we move in-service date, a full-year, that means we're foregoing cash flow in 2021, and part of 2022 in Atlantic Coast Pipeline and that is substantial cash flow driver. We\u2019re committed, as we said to our metrics, we're targeting FFO to debt of 15% to 16%. We think that is appropriate and consistent with the way the agencies look at us. You know that Moody's has us on stable, S&P has us on negative outlook, really looking not only ACP, but a number of other developments in our regulated business. And so I would look at this is us being responsive to developments that have occurred around an important project and consistent with our commitment to the balance sheet, which we have been clear about all along. So combination together is the way I would think about this equity issuance. And I'll look to Steve to see if he would add? Steven Young : Yes, I would echo that entirely and we certainly want to have a solid balance sheet and the measure you think about there is a 50% FFO. And so we want to make sure that we can attain that. And as Lynn said, a delay of a project of this magnitude has a lot of cash flow implications. And so we want to be mindful of that and be proactive. And I think this will give us flexibility on the back-end of things as well. Praful Mehta : Got you. That's very helpful context. Appreciate that. And then maybe just quickly on coal ash and the DQE order. Just what is the current status of the appeal on that? Is there anything that you can share on the process there, I know you're expecting it to go well into 2020 as you reference on your slides, but just wanted to see how to think about that, that process? Lynn Good : Praful, it is still moving forward. We\u2019re pursuing appeal through the OAH and also the North Carolina Superior Court. Our appeals are focused, or our claims are focused not only on the process that led to the decision, but also the substance of the decision. And so that process continues and as we reach milestones, we will of course update on that. But that's where I would leave it at this point. Praful Mehta : Got you. Finally, just on Florida, clearly positive in terms of the Senate Bill 796 and the authority around good investment, any color on opportunities to further increase your CapEx associated with this? I know you said you're evaluating everything that comes out of it. But how should we think about that and timing around what this could result in terms of incremental CapEx? Lynn Good : Sure. And Praful the Florida has been an environment that is recognized the need for grid investments. And we have been investing in hardening of our grid for some time. Right now, as part of our multi-year rate plan, we have over a $1 billion of investment underway. And that plan runs through 2021, so we would see the potential to take advantage of this additional storm hardening as we look at resetting our multi-year rate plan for 2022 and forward, which gives us an opportunity to really put additional investment to work in Florida. Praful Mehta : Got you. Well, thanks so much guys. Lynn Good : Thank you. Steven Young : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will next go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning, Lynn and team. Steven Young : Good morning. Lynn Good : Hi Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, so I'm going to try to follow-up on some of the prior questions here a little bit more specifically, I believe in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit more about additional distribution and infrastructure spend resulting from the equity raise as well as dealing with ACP. And I understand that ACP is to a large extent at least at present, a timing-related issue. Can you elaborate on potential opportunities on that side in tandem with this capital raise to kind of think about and I know, we're a little bit ahead of the 4Q cycle to discuss that, but I just wanted to kind of dig in a little further on sort of the twin purposes at least disclosed for the capital raise and understand also maybe at the same time, relative to that 15% FFO to debt, where do you stand and how much latitude do you have in your metrics to see some of that cash flow degradation at the outset that you described from the delay in ACP? Lynn Good : So let me talk about grid investment first and then we can get to metrics Julien, what I would say on grid investment is we see an increasing interest in investment in the grid throughout our service territory. Florida, we talked about a moment ago Praful had questions around the Florida legislation. We also referenced Ohio, there's a Health Bill 247 that's moving through in Ohio. We've got TDSIC in Indiana, that has been an important investment opportunity and then the Clean Energy Plan that will progress in the Carolinas in 2020 also has a specific focus on modernizing the grid to support clean energy resilience, and other initiatives. So we feel like there's just a lot of policy discussion around the grid that will give us an opportunity to continue to add capital in a way that delivers benefits to customers and also benefits to shareholders. I think the timing of how that rolls out will be jurisdiction by jurisdiction, I would think about Florida's being 2022. Ohio, I think we have to get the bill passed yet to see where that's going to lie. And then we'll progress on the Clean Energy Plan during 2020 in the Carolinas, and have a better sense of where that capital will be deployed. Within our $37 million, we already have a fair amount of capital that's underway and we\u2019ll of course continue to execute that. On metrics, we should close 2019 at 15% and Steve, why don't you talk about what you see in 2020 and 2021? Steven Young : Right, we should be at 15% and as we move forward, we\u2019ll be in the 15% range and the equity issuance and advancements of other efforts in rate cases should start to drive us north of 15% as we move into 2020, 2021 and beyond. And that's our goal is to be in the 15% to 16% range. That would give us sufficient headroom to deal with the types of things that pop-up, such as hurricanes or other issues. And we think that'll give us sufficient flexibility in our financial plan with this equity. And as we said earlier, if things can work out with Atlantic Coast Pipeline coming on, we have the opportunity to ramp-back on the ATM or to invest in the type of infrastructure that Lynn alluded to. There's a lot of opportunities out there. So that's basically the plan to get north of 15% in the 15% to 16% range, and we'll be doing that as we move through 2021 and beyond. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Can you quickly elaborate just in terms of the 2020 dynamics, specifically you alluded to a flat clean infrastructure renewable contribution next year, and I think if I understand it, right, the equity capital should have a minimal impact next year as well just based on timing, but I don't want to put words in your mouth on that. And then maybe\u2026 Lynn Good : Yes, the minimal dilution in 2020, commercial renewables will be flat and the drivers that Steve outlined, I think it's Slide 14, Julien are very comprehensive. So I think you can track through those in a way that gives you a lot of confidence on 2020. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay, confidence as in the current trajectory? Lynn Good : Yes. Steven Young : Yes. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, all right, great. Thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : And next, we'll go to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey guys, couple of questions. First of all, on the commercial renewable side, how are you thinking about investment going forward, meaning in 2021, I get you'd love to do more at the utilities. I'm just curious, trying to get my arms around your plans when you're thinking about the next couple of years? Steven Young : Well, we\u2019ll roll out and update our capital plan in February, as you know, Michael. But we had laid out last February about $2.5 billion of capital through 2023. As I mentioned earlier, we're doing about a $1 billion this year, it'll be lesser amounts going forward, I think we'll be deploying an amount of capital that will keep the earnings profile, relatively flat in the $200 million range is what we're looking at. I'd mentioned earlier that to keep that profile going forward, we need to land to 300 megawatts a year of projects, given the earnings profile, and so forth. So I don't see the capital proportionally growing in this particular segment as we go forward, but there will be capital as we land a few new projects each year. Lynn Good : And then, Michael, like, Florida solar is directly in the regulated capital plan. So the 700 megawatts that we're building there. And to the extent we build any of the CPRE and the regulated utility in the Carolinas, that capital would be in the regulated capital plan. Michael Lapides : Thank you for that. Just one follow-up though, can you how much of a benefit occurred in 2019 earnings so far that are impacting tax that are related to ITC benefits you took for projects that came online this year? Steven Young : Well, a lot of the growth that we saw and targeted for commercial renewables was from solar projects and those that profitability is driven by the tax benefits. And when we close tax partnership arrangements there, you recognize a lot of the tax benefits. So we've got $139 million of net income so far this year. We've got a combination of some wind and solar projects, the solar projects in particular hit the earnings early. Lynn Good : Michael, I think it's important to recognize that these projects are locked in for 2019 and 2020. And we are committed to a flat trajectory, around $200 million of net income over the five-year period and 70% of that is already committed in our pipeline. So it's an important part of this business. But I think in terms of the volatility, or any volatility, you could expect, this is an area that we feel like we have very well developed and managed. Steven Young : And I would also add that the projects that will be landing prospectively starting in 2020, will utilize a structure that we believe will have a more of the spread of earnings recognition over a three to five year time periods. Michael Lapides : Thank you. No, I appreciate that. I was just trying to think about is there, I don't know like an EPS not cliff, but an EPS draft, if you do fewer projects in the next couple of years than you're doing this year in 2019. And therefore you have less kind of one-time tax benefits in those future years? Lynn Good : I think you should include in your model roughly $200 million to $220 million of net income for the next five years, because that's what we have in ours, that we're committed to deliver. Michael Lapides : Okay, and then one final, final item. Just curious, given this new kind of financing need, how you're thinking about M&A? I mean, obviously, there's some situations that are very public out there, municipals or cooperatives being sold in both Florida and South Carolina. But does the -- the balance sheet constraint in the credit metrics requiring the new equity does that change your view at all on kind of broader sector M&A, or asset M&A? Lynn Good : No, we think about what we talked about today, Michael is within the construct of a very robust organic growth plan, that includes strong regulated investment, $37 billion of growth capital. I think you're talking about Santee Cooper or perhaps JEA. We are involved in those processes. We know both of those assets well, and we would evaluate those on whether or not it makes sense to be a part of that process going forward and whether we believe we can deliver value to shareholders. So we think about that as a separate and distinct analysis that we will accomplish in a way that makes sense. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, Lynn, thanks Steve. Much appreciate you all. Lynn Good : Thank you. Steven Young : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our time for questions today. I\u2019d like to pass the conference back over to Ms. Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks. Lynn Good : Great, well thank you everyone for your questions and your interest and investment in Duke. We look forward to seeing many of you at EEI in the next few days. So thanks again. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today\u2019s call. Again we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Duke Energy Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Bryan Buckler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Bryan Buckler : Great. Thank you, Derek. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Review and Business Update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President, and CFO.  Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information. Slide 2 presents our safe harbor statement. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found in today's materials and on duke-energy.com. Please note the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures.  With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Bryan, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced 2019 adjusted earnings per share of $5.06, representing 7% growth over last year and solidly within the 4% to 6% earnings guidance range from the 2017 base year. 2019 also marked our 93rd consecutive year paying a quarterly dividend to our shareholders. We recognize that consistent growth in earnings and dividends are important to our investors, and we are delivering. I'm very proud of our employees' commitment and hard work throughout the year. We achieved these financial results while maintaining our focus on the customer. Our reliability statistics improved by 15% and our internal customer satisfaction metrics improved 25%, a clear indication that we are enhancing the customer experience. The foundation of outstanding service territories and ample low-risk investment opportunities to benefit our customers gives us great confidence in the strength of our business into 2020 and beyond. We have introduced a guidance range of $5.05 to $5.45, with a midpoint of $5.25, reflecting solid 5% growth into 2020. We have also expanded our EPS growth target of 4% to 6% through 2024, built on an expanded capital program.  Slide 4 outlines the drivers and opportunities for expanding infrastructure in our jurisdictions. Our service territories are thriving. The Carolinas and Florida lead the East Coast and population growth, driving strong economies and energy infrastructure needs.  GDP growth projections for those areas as well as Nashville, Tennessee also exceeds the national average. To meet the needs of our customers in these regions, we have a $56 billion capital plan over the next five years, 90% of which will be deployed in our regulated electric and gas LDC businesses and drive earnings based growth from transparent low-risk investments. Compared to our previous plan, the new plan represents a 12% increase and a projected $6 billion increase in our earnings base by 2024.  These capital investments represent an excellent foundation to expand our 4% to 6% growth rate through 2024. Steve will provide more detail on the five year capital plan in a minute. We are proud of the work we do to power the lives of our customers. We support the health and prosperity of the communities we serve, not only through investments in our infrastructure but also through our work in the economic development, community leadership and foundation given.  We also recognize the importance of maintaining competitive electric and gas rates. And are pleased that our rates are well below the national average, driven by top quartile O&M performance and a diverse generation mix. The strong and growing jurisdictions we serve at Duke Energy set us apart, and we will continue investing in our grid and clear generation bringing our customers the affordable and reliable service they expect from us.  Moving to Slide 5. Our focus remains unchanged and is grounded in our vision to lead the way to cleaner, smarter energy solutions that our customers value. We place our customers at the center of everything we do. And our vision guides our actions and our investments. We believe a customer-focused strategy will also deliver superior returns to our investors over time. The strategy is rightfully underpinned by 2 foundational elements : first, excellence in operations, which we demand of ourselves and our communities require; and secondly, excellence in stakeholder engagement.  2019 marked another year of strong results in our operations and important progress in stakeholder engagement. I wanted to share a few examples of our important work with stakeholders in 2019. We reached an important settlement with the North Carolina Department of Environmental quality and key community groups on closure plans for our remaining coal ash sites in the state. This milestone agreement clarifies the methodology and time frame to address all ash in the basins and enables us to move forward as we transition to cleaner generation.  We believe it is a reasonable and constructive approach that protects communities and the environment, both saving our customers over $1 billion in cost. In addition, in North Carolina, we successfully advocated for storm securitization legislation, which became law in November and reached constructive outcomes in our Piedmont rate cases in both North and South Carolina. We also announced our comprehensive plan to reduce carbon emissions, targeting at least a 50% reduction by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050.  Our updated goals are supported by our announced plans to extend the operating licenses for all of our nuclear units. These units, which will be vital to meeting our carbon goals, achieved a capacity factor above 90% for the 21st consecutive year. We understand the importance of accelerating the path to zero carbon and look forward to working with stakeholders in each of our states to turn these goals into reality. As we turn to Slide 6, delivering superior returns to our investors drives us and is the commitment of our team at Duke Energy.  Increasingly, our investors are also looking at our results on environment, social responsibility and governance matters. We're very proud of our track record here and consistent with our vision are committed to lead. From establishing industry-leading carbon reduction goals to announcing more than 1,500 megawatts of new wind and solar projects in 2019, we're making significant progress. Last year alone, we further reduced carbon emissions an additional 8% from 2005 levels, bringing our total decrease to 39%. Additionally, our broad array of energy efficiency programs in the Carolinas have created significant savings for our customers, well ahead of national averages for these types of programs while further reducing our carbon footprint.  Duke Energy is also committed to social responsibility, sound governance, and transparent disclosures. We issued our first climate report analyzing the two degree scenario in 2018 and plan to issue an updated report this year. Our ESG ratings reflect our work over more than a decade on sustainability initiatives, and our ratings continue to increase. Many of our investors have an interest in ESG topics, and we understand the importance of achieving excellence in these areas as we move into the next decade. We will be hosting an ESG Investor Day in May. And I'm excited to update all of you on the impressive work we're doing with Duke Energy.  Let me close on Slide 7. Looking beyond our 5-year plan as the strength of our business and our future investment opportunities. We see great potential in the 3 investment priorities we've shared with you over the last few years. Modernizing the energy grid, generating cleaner energy and expanding natural gas infrastructure. Duke Energy's T&D grid across our regulated footprint represents the largest system in the nation, with more than 300,000 line miles of infrastructure. In support of our long-term strategy, we will continue to advance modernization and improvement projects to enable renewables, protected in storms and security trucks and serve the rapidly growing populations in our service areas. The transition to cleaner generation also provides a multi-decade investment opportunity. Our 2030 commitment to reduce carbon emissions by at least 50% includes offering our existing carbon-free resources, retiring certain less-efficient plants and investing in renewables and natural gas infrastructure. As an example, the appetite for utility-scale solar in Florida continues to rise, and we expect to bring more than 1,750 megawatts online through 2030. In the Carolinas and the Midwest, significant investments will be needed as we transition these fleets away from coal-fired generation.  Our LDC business will also continue to produce opportunities for investment in natural gas infrastructure. We see tremendous value creation from our Piedmont and Midwest gas utilities, which are expected to grow net income at a 12% CAGR through 2024. Population and economic growth in the Southeast, coupled with the important role of natural gas in transforming our generation mix will drive incremental investment opportunities for years to come. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline also represents important infrastructure for our customers in the Carolinas. We have included Slide 17 in the appendix to provide an update on the permit status and financial considerations around the pipeline.  We continue to work towards securing the required permits for the project as we await the Supreme Court's decision on the Appalachian Trail crossing, customer arena, balancing value to customers and a fair return for the project owners. Our expectation is that we will have a more comprehensive update on ACP midyear.  Investing in the grid, generating cleaner energy and expanding natural gas infrastructure are critical to the customers and communities we serve and will create meaningful shareholder value for the next decade and beyond. As I look ahead, I'm more confident than ever that we will deliver strong long-term returns to our shareholders and provide industry-leading service to our customers.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. Steven Young : Thanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. 2019 was an outstanding year of execution for the company. As shown on Slide 8, our full year reported and adjusted earnings per share of $5.06 was above the midpoint of our original and revised 2019 guidance range.  This represents a 5% CAGR since our portfolio transition in 2017 and 7% earnings growth over 2018. During the third and fourth quarters, we recognized our exceptional year-to-date financial results and took the opportunity to reinvest in our business, deploying additional O&M dollars into customer service and funding charitable contributions to the Duke Energy Foundation. This agility positions the company well to deliver on our financial targets in 2020 and 2021, just as we did in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Our strong results were driven by clear growth across each of our operating segments. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure growth was approximately $0.25 per share and was anchored by our Florida operations, which benefited from the first year of the multiyear rate plan and solar investments.  We also saw solid growth in our Carolinas operations with strong rider revenues from our best-in-class energy efficiency programs and rate cases. These favorable drivers for the segment were partially offset by regulatory lag, primarily in the Carolinas.  Shifting to Gas Utilities and Infrastructure. We saw higher results in both our LDC businesses in the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The gas LDCs continue to provide strong earnings, driven by customer additions, investments in integrity management and power generation infrastructure as well as a constructive outcome in the Piedmont's North Carolina rate case in the fourth quarter. Our commercial renewables business delivered approximately $200 million of income in 2019. Going forward, we expect this segment to continue delivering between $200 million and $250 million of net income per year over the 5-year plan.  Overall, Duke Energy delivered outstanding results in 2019, marking another year of achieving our financial commitments. The Duke portfolio, in place since late 2016, has consistently performed well and is positioned for 2020 and beyond.  Turning to Slide 9. As we look to 2020, we've announced our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $5.05 to $5.45 with a $5.25 midpoint. This represents 5% growth over the midpoint of our original 2019 earnings per share guidance range of $5. We put together a strong financial plan for 2020, and our core utilities will continue to drive upwards earnings trajectory. For Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, growth will come from our critical investment programs. In Florida, similar to 2019, we expect very strong earnings contributions as we move into the second year of our multiyear rate plan. Results in Florida will be further supported by rapid deployment of solar generation. In the Carolinas, we will see full year contributions from the 2019 South Carolina rate cases and expect new retail rates to become effective in North Carolina in the third quarter of 2020.  Finally, in addition to the steady income growth that comes from our Midwest T&D infrastructure investments, we expect new rates for Duke Energy Indiana by midyear. We forecast long-term annual load growth in a 0.5% range and expect 2020 to be even stronger given recent encouraging signs with our industrial customers and the benefit of leap year. The most significant 2020 growth driver for Gas Utilities and Infrastructure will be the full year earnings impact of the Piedmont, North Carolina rate case, given new rates were effective in November 2019.  Our LDC businesses continue to experience increasing customer growth, driving year-over-year margin improvement. We're also heavily investing in integrity management programs across our footprint, recovering these important investments through annual rider mechanisms. In our Gas Midstream business, we expect higher AFUDC on Atlantic Coast Pipeline, with full construction activities beginning in the second half of the year. However, 2020's overall ACP results will be relatively flat, given 2019 benefited from a tax true up. In Commercial Renewables, we expect a slight uptick in results this year as wind production returns to normal and as our 60-megawatt Palmer solar project will now go into commercial operation in 2020. Otherwise, this segment's results will remain relatively consistent over the 5-year plan.  Slide 10 provides a view of our primary EPS growth drivers for 2021, many of which were similar to the 2020 drivers. Florida continues to be a major contributor of 2021 net income bolstered by the third year of the multiyear rate plan and our 700-megawatt solar investment program. We expect solid contributions from other core operations in the Carolinas and Midwest as we invest in needed infrastructure. Our LDC businesses will experience rapid growth as we deploy capital to serve new customers and increase the integrity of the existing system. And as I discussed during our November call, higher Atlantic Coast Pipeline earnings in 2021 will fully offset the dilution from the $2.5 billion equity forward that will be settled later this year.  Lastly, I'd like to point you to our appendix slides, which highlights Duke Energy's top quartile leadership and O&M cost per customer. But we are still early in our journey. Our industry-leading innovation centers hitting its stride by scaling digital capabilities, such as mobile tools for field workers, artificial intelligence usage, drones, and automation to transform our operations and back-office processes. We will continue to leverage these capabilities to drive efficiencies and productivity across the enterprise.  Turning to Slide 11. I'd like to reiterate some of the points Lynn shared earlier regarding the rapidly expanding infrastructure needs of our operations and communities. We have responded by increasing our 5-year capital plan by over $6 billion to benefit our customers and deliver value for shareholders. The vitality of our communities translates into long-term growth opportunities as we make significant investments and position our cities and communities to remain competitive for jobs and business development. In turn, our communities rely more than ever on our ability to attract low-cost capital to make these investments. Our unique investor growth proposition, coupled with a long history of constructive regulatory outcomes, provide the right balance to lead Duke Energy and its communities into the next chapter of our energy future.  The Florida Capital Plan is underscored by solar investments and grid improvements, including targeted undergrounding. Storm protection plan legislation supports the deployment and recovery of these grid investments, driving our increased capital. We expect to file our SPP plans in the first half of this year with the program taking effect in late 2021 or early '22. In the Carolinas, we see significant needs for T&D capacity and improvement projects to support the expansion of renewables as well as rapid population and economic growth. Turning to our Gas LDCs. Strong economic growth drives tremendous need for infrastructure investments, including our integrity management programs.  Further, as we transition to energy -- cleaner energy sources, we have dual-fuel capital projects at existing coal plants, which moves us closer to achieving our carbon reduction targets. This highlights the complementary nature of our Electric and Gas businesses.  Turning to Slide 12. Our ability to execute on our robust capital program is underpinned by our strengthened balance sheet and solid credit ratings, which are stable on both S&P and Moody's. We continue to expect to issue $500 million of equity per year through 2022 via the DRIP and ATM programs. And as we discussed last quarter, once ACP comes online, we will have the balance sheet flexibility to moderate or eliminate annual equity issues. As a reminder, we plan to settle the $2.5 billion equity forward related to last year's issuance in December 2020, resulting in minimal dilution this year.  Shifting to Slide 13. We understand the value of the dividend to our investors, over 40% of whom are retail shareholders. 2020 will mark the 94th consecutive year paying a quarterly cash dividend, and we remain a top-tier dividend yield investment.  We are committed to continue growing the dividend in the future and finished 2019 with a dividend payout ratio of 74%. As we have said previously, our objective is to reduce that payout ratio over time, more in line with peers, particularly given our robust capital plan. Over the near term, we will set our dividend growth to better position ourselves within a payout ratio range of 65% to 75%, trending to the lower end of this range over the 5-year period.  Before we open it up for questions, let me turn to Slide 14. Our attractive dividend yield coupled with earnings growth from investments in our regulated utilities provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for shareholders. We are positioned to deliver results for both customers and shareholders and are confident in the plan we have for 2020 and beyond. With that, we'll open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we'll first take Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : So a big jump in CapEx and the rate base is obviously up $6 billion in 23. Can we talk a bit more on sort of the higher numbers and maybe even focusing on 23, especially in Florida, where I think you're expecting to file the formal GRCs later this year? I mean, i.e. base assumptions in the upcoming GRC versus the plan you kind of presented today? And could we see some further upside if the outcome is a little bit more constructive, especially if you've got support from sort of your healthy macro backdrop that you highlighted? Lynn Good : Sure. Thank you for the question. We did layout in the slide deck the underlying investments around the $6 billion, $1.5 billion of it is in Florida, $4 billion in Carolinas and then we see incremental investment in our Gas LDCs of $1 billion. But I think to your point, the recent legislation in Florida represents a longer-term opportunity, and we see up to $5 billion over a decade or so of investment in that infrastructure. And as we move through the process of finalizing our existing multiyear plan and resetting that into the future, I do believe there will be ongoing potential for investment in Florida in a way that adds a lot of value to customers and investors. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. And then just one, lastly on North Carolina coal ash. It's obviously kind of the fluid situation still. Is there any read-throughs to Dominion's recent notice of decision, which essentially extended the recovery period for their ash spend, but with no return on that spend prospectively? I mean assuming this is kind of applicable to you, can you kind of break this outcome down relative to your $8.5 billion total CCR costs if we sort of apply that same method -- methodology as we did with Dominion? Lynn Good : Sure. Shahriar, the first point I would make on this, which I think is really important is the Dominion order did provide recovery of the costs. And that is a significant outcome, which we, of course, believe makes sense given its decommissioning of coal plants that have provided great value to our customers over generations. We have read the notice of decision, but I also think it's important to recognize that we have not yet seen the order. So we don't understand all of the elements, we don't understand the rationale. I think it's fair to say that this order will be specific to the facts and circumstances in this case. And although we'll learn from it, I'm not prepared to say how it will impact us directly. But we will be presenting our case in the DEC case in March and DEP in May and hopefully have the opportunity to learn more from the order as we prepare to enter into those proceedings. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. But just a follow-up. But just given sort of your CapEx outlook and sort of how healthy it is. Is it fair to assume that you can absorb whatever outcome that does come about in that case, assuming there, for instance, isn\u2019t a return on that spend? Lynn Good : Shahriar, when we put together a 5-year plan, we do so assuming a range of outcomes. And so that would include amortization, that would include various assumptions around cost recovery. But I also want to emphasize that we believe a lack of return over an extended amortization period is detrimental to our balance sheet and the customers over the long term, and therefore, we believe these costs ought to earn a return. There is a cost of financing associated with anything that -- of this nature, and our cost of financing should be considered as part of cost of service. So we will be making those points as part of the case. Operator : Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Perhaps just to follow-up on the Carolinas here, if you don't mind. First, possibilities here on just rate case settlement and just prospects on the timeline, if you will? And then related to that, obviously, you've laid out a pretty impressive updated outlook. How do you think about this tying into some of the updates moving in-flight in parallel at the state level on sort of the grid mod side of the equation, I think, in the DEQ side? Lynn Good : On the first question, Julien, on settlement. We always explore opportunities for settlement in every case. I think when you think about the number of issues in any rate case, if we can get to resolution of any of them in advance, we'll certainly look to do that. We did that in the Carolina cases, you may recall the last time around, at least as it pertains to ROE and cap structure. So I can't forecast with certainty how that will occur or if it will occur, but we'll certainly explore those opportunities. On your second question around how it relates to each of the jurisdictions and capital. I'll take a shot at and maybe some clarity of the question would be helpful. Recently, if we hear\u2026 Julien Dumoulin-Smith: With Carolinas, specifically. Lynn Good : Sure. So we believe we've made the case soundly in all of our jurisdictions about the importance of the energy delivery system to be the backbone of the transition of renewable generation, storm hardening and the resiliency. We've had hurricane exposure in all of our southeastern jurisdictions over the last 4 years. And then cyber and physical security threats are something that are not unique to Duke Energy, but certainly important for our industry. So we feel like we've laid the groundwork for that. I think, Julien, we'll be involved in stakeholder meetings throughout 2020 in the Carolinas to further discussions around the clean energy plan. And as part of that, it will be not only advancement of how to achieve further carbon reduction but also further methods to modernize regulation, performance-based rate-making and other things that would fit quite nicely with our strategy around clean generation and good investment. So as the stakeholder processes progress in 2020 and into 2021, we'll look for opportunities to continue to pursue regulatory modernization that fits with these investments. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And then separately, if I could just follow-up on the higher level of rate base, how do you think about the financing? Just -- I know you guys did the equity last year. You haven't projected FFO to debt metric here, but I just want to try to tie that all back together when you think about the updated stable projection. Steven Young : Sure. As I alluded to, we priced out the $2.5 billion of equity, we will settle that in late 2020. That plus the DRIP/ATM equity through 2022 are the equity needs that we see will finance the rest of our needs and refundings through a combination of holding company and operating company debt issuances. And we feel comfortable about that financing plan and maintaining the credit ratings. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Maybe just if I can rephrase that slightly, and you tell me if I'm not saying it right. The equity forward effectively pays for the incremental CapEx such that your metrics are largely unchanged. And then I know that there was previously a conversation around ACP and providing some buffer. Do you want to just reconcile the ACP conversation versus the CapEx plan prospectively? It sounds like you've effectively used incremental equity now to pay for the plan this year. But I just want to also make sure we've addressed the prior commentary about ACP outcomes? Steven Young : Right. Let me give some clarity here. The incremental equity dealt with Atlantic Coast Pipeline and delays associated with that and the cash flows, that, therefore, delayed when we determine the project needed to go in 1 phase in 2022 as opposed to having cash flows coming in, in 2021. And that equity dealt with a number of ranges of outcomes with ACP, and it still does. The incremental CapEx spend that we got in the plan, we can deal with under that same amount of equity. We've got other tools that we've utilized. We issued $1 billion of equity content securities in 2019 at very attractive rates. We have continued to find operational efficiencies through O&M that we described earlier that helps the balance sheet as well. We executed on the John Hancock transaction, and could envision dropping other assets into mechanisms like that, that provide some liquidity. So the equity -- the $2.5 billion equity has not been used up for the incremental CapEx. We can deal with it with the equity I described. Operator : We will next go to Steve Fleishman with Wolf Research. Steven Fleishman : So a couple of questions. First, just a technical one. The 2019, it looks like a lot of the deep versus your segment guidance came in the Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment. Can you just explain what drove that? Lynn Good : So we had a couple of things here, Steve, of course, strong results from capital deployment, rate case outcomes, et cetera, Atlantic Coast Pipeline is in there. And we also had a half adjustments on recognition of the way allowance for funds have been recorded on the pipeline which drove the LDC businesses as well. Steve, would you add to that? Steven Young : Yes, I would say, looking at 2019, we had strong growth across all of our segments. You look at the Electric Utilities, we had a full year of the 2018 North Carolina rate cases. We had a partial year of the 2019 South Carolina rate cases. We saw Midwest grid continue to roll through. We had the Ohio rate case that added a few cents. Our energy efficiency rider, particularly in the Carolinas, added several cents. So we saw good, solid growth on the electric side. So I would add that. Steven Fleishman : Okay. I'm just looking at Slide 21, where it just shows actual versus original assumptions? And it looks like Gas Utilities be by a lot. So that's why I'm curious... Steven Young : In terms of the beat versus that [indiscernible] Steven Fleishman : Yes. So that was -- okay. We can follow-up on that. It's just... Steven Young : We saw growth in electric a bit and gas a bit more that pushed us above our target. Lynn Good : Steve, the three things in Gas LDC, ACP and the tax adjustment around allowance for funds. Those are the three drivers. Steven Young : Right. Steven Fleishman : Okay. And then just on ACP, at a high level, in the unfortunate event that it somehow doesn't get done. How would you characterize the -- how to think about your 4% to 6%? Lynn Good : Steve, I would characterize the 5-year period is having great flexibility. And by that, I mean the robust capital plan that we have outlined for the utilities, positions the utilities very solidly within a 4% to 6% guidance range. And that gives us confidence that those utilities are going to continue to grow and grow well. And we have demonstrated the growth in those utilities over several years. And hopefully, that gives you confidence as well in our ability to deliver.  I think on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, we will work our way through it. As we spoke about a moment ago, we've taken the step of strengthening the balance sheet to absorb a range of options. We have flexibility with our capital plans to make adjustments, to put in a plan B if one is required to build gas infrastructure to meet the needs that ACP would have met. We also have the opportunity to expand or accelerate good investments in a number of our jurisdictions. And then the ongoing productivity and flexibility around O&M represents another lever that we have in addressing returns over a 5-year period.  We have demonstrated the ability to achieve reductions in flexibility in O&M across our diverse businesses, and we see further opportunities over the 5-year period. So we're committed to driving low-risk regulated growth in earnings and dividend, and we believe that we have the capability of doing that. But we will work our way through ACP, and I think 2020 is an important year to hit some of these milestones, and we'll update all along the way. Steven Young : Steve, I just want to go -- to go back to your question, just to also let you know for 2019, we had a beat of our original target by $0.06, but I'd also want to highlight that we accelerated $0.04 of O&M from future years for foundation contributions. We also accelerated several cents for vedge management from future years in this particular calendar year. So we had a lot of optimization around 2019 as well. Absent those things, the beat would have been larger. So I just want to make it clear. Steven Fleishman : Yes. That's great. And then one other just quick thing, that the $4 billion of incremental spending in the Carolinas, is it -- it sounds like it's mainly T&D spending. Just, is there any coal ash related spend of new plan in there? Or is that kind of past that period? Steven Young : So there's no incremental coal ash spend in that number at all. It's a -- there's a comparable level to what we've had in the past. Operator : We'll next go to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd : Congrats on a constructive update. I wanted to talk about Florida a little bit. Solar economics continue to trend favorably, and you've highlighted Florida as one area of incremental growth. Over time, I guess, longer-term, if we continue to see solar costs drop, is there a fairly significant opportunity to make even bigger changes to your generation mix in the state? Or are there other reasons why that that wouldn't be the case of solar cost drop further? Lynn Good : Stephen, I believe there are increasing opportunities, and we will watch those economics all along the way. And as I think back over even the last 2 to 3 years. Every time we set a forward forecast, it has increased and improved. And I think that will be the case into the 2020s. Stephen Byrd : Understood. The number that you've laid out is essentially sort of -- I know you haven't specifically laid out the amount of solar you sort of put Florida together, but we'll be seeing a resource plan that you all layout in, I believe, in April in Florida, which could show further progress in terms of moving towards renewables. Is that fair to say? Lynn Good : Yes. And at this point, we're forecasting 1,750 megawatts of solar, Stephen. And we'll continue to update that as we go. But I think to your point, as you think out over a decade, the bias is that number is going to go up. Stephen Byrd : That's helpful. And then just lastly, going to -- start to hit on the financing needs, just wanted to kind of think through scenarios. In the unfortunate outcome, if it ends up that the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project is not able to move forward either because of the Supreme Court ruling or the biological opinion, how would that -- sort of that single impact sort of your overall equity needs? And in other words, is the sort of financing plan fairly flexible and you wouldn't envision incremental equity in that scenario? Or how do you think about that that sort of outcome? Lynn Good : Stephen, I believe we've taken care of the range of outcomes on ACP with a $2.5 billion. The one thing in the financing plan that we would evaluate as we have the DRIP and ATM on through, I believe, 2022, with an idea that we potentially could moderate in '23 and '24 if ACP is on. We will evaluate whether or not the DRIP and ATM should be a part of the financing plan in all events for '23 and '24 depending on outcome. But I think that's the only thing I would point to is something that we'll have ongoing evaluation. But we feel like that we've put in front of you with the equity that we've issued and maintaining the DRIP through 2022 with this additional capital is a solid plan that will meet our credit metrics, our earnings guidance and absorb outcomes around ACP. Operator : We will next go to Michael Weinstein with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Michael Weinstein : Can we talk a little bit about commercial renewables? And what the growth plan is for that going forward? You had some projects that pushed out to 2020. So you have a $240 million assumption for that year. And I think it's up $0.06. So that would imply about $0.19 for 2020. Is that sort of the new level going forward or is that going to grow beyond that? And how many megawatts is required to keep that up anyway? Steven Young : Sure, Mike. We're looking at having commercial renewables contribute between $200 million and $250 million a year during the plan. It will depend on the timing of projects. But that's keeping pretty level -- pretty flat with the level that they got to in 2019. So we're not showing a lot of growth there. We did shift the Palmer solar project to 2020. That was another optimization move as we got late in the year.  That will help the 2020 earnings. But they'll be between $200 million and $250 million a year through our plan. We've got all of 2020 lined up and locked up, and we've got 60% of the net income over the 5-year period in hand as well. So a rough number that you think about is roughly landing 300 megawatts a year of projects to keep that going. And between the markets that we're in and the crispy programs in North Carolina and so forth, we think that's very attainable. Michael Weinstein : Got it. And ACP, you've said that you don't expect any dilution from the prior forward. As a result of earnings, and particularly after the pipeline goes in service. And I'm just wondering is that as a result of higher rates on the pipeline going forward or is it -- are you banking on higher volumes through compression? Is there a lag period between the in-service period and the lack of dilution? Or is there -- like maybe a divet period in between there? Lynn Good : So Mike, we have given you some financial considerations on Slide 17 on allowance for funds in '20 and then full year in-service in '22 and beyond, what you can expect in terms of the contribution of ACP. The dilution that we will experience in 2021 will be absorbed by incremental allowance for funds in that year while the project is still under construction. And so I would think about putting that equity into the plan in 2021. And then the combination of the utility results we've shared with you today as well as what we're sharing on ACP is the earnings platform with financing that you can expect over the 5-year period. Michael Weinstein : One last question. Just to confirm, how much is -- or how much financing have you already committed to the project at this point? I think it's around $2 billion, including excluding AFUDC at this point? Steven Young : Yes, the gross project costs are about $2 billion on our books now. We've got about $800 million or $900 million of construction financing against that. Michael Weinstein : And would you expect that to pick up, I guess, once the Supreme Court rules or is that maybe before that at some point? Lynn Good : I'm sorry, Mike, I couldn't hear that question. Michael Weinstein : All right. Are we at a point with additional spending start to roll insignificantly? Is it going to be after the Supreme Court rules? Lynn Good : So the gating item on construction is the biological opinion and the incidental take statement. So the restoration of the environmental impact study. So if you look again at Slide 17, we're forecasting that reissuance of the permit in the middle part of 2020. So you should think about construction as being in the latter -- restart of construction mean the latter half of 2020. Operator : We'll next take Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Andrew Weisel : So first question, a very impressive CapEx update. For '19 through '23, it looks like your spending is up roughly 15% or so. But when I look at the earnings-based outlook, the increase is more modest at around 5% depending on the year. Could you please help me reconcile those? And what are some of the offsets? Steven Young : Yes, I think our rate base growth is at the 6% level over the period of time there. And CapEx may vary in terms of how it's loaded through the type of CapEx, but I'd have to look in more detail on that and the IR team can help you with that. Lynn Good : Even if you look at the capital in the appendix that will give you a sense of the growth in each of the utilities. So on average, every utility is growing within the 4% to 6% range. Some are higher than that. And Gas, of course, is higher than that. But the combination, the average of all of the utilities together are at the 6% CAGR. Andrew Weisel : Right. I understand that. I'm not talking about year-over-year growth. I'm talking about your new guidance versus the prior guidance. I should have been more clear. Lynn Good : So we have laid out on Slide 11 kind of how this comes in. And I think we could spend some time with the IR team to give you some specifics on what it looks like in '20, '21, '22. I think the combination of that chart in the detail in the appendix, we'd be happy to walk you through. Andrew Weisel : Okay. I'll follow up off-line. My next question is, can you talk a bit about the industrial demand. Obviously, it's -- you're not the only one seeing this, but it was pretty soft last year, fourth quarter, in particular. And then, I think, you mentioned the uplift in 2020 from the leap day, but maybe if you could just talk about adjusted expectations over the next few quarters? Steven Young : Sure. 2019 was a rough year for the economy as a whole and that translated to our industry and lower kilowatt-hour sales. We saw that in many of our peers as well. The good news for us is that we see tremendous customer growth. We saw the best customer growth in 2019 we've seen in many years, particularly in the Carolinas and Florida. As we look forward, we'll see some of that customer growth translate into some favorable growth, we believe. We also think that there will be some rebound as we look at some of our industrial customers. A few have had some singular issues with outages, supply chain issues and so forth. So we think they may get some traction as we move forward in 2020 to help rebound off a bad year. Our overall growth expectation, load growth expectation is 0.5%. And there'll be years like 2018 that are very strong years followed by some years that are a little weaker, but we think that's a reasonable place to be over the 5-year period. We do expect to see some growth over '19 and 2020 as '19 was kind of a low year. And again, we're seeing some favorable indicators from some of our industrials in our service territories. Lynn Good : Andrew, the only thing I would add to that is all of our jurisdictions continue to perform with GDPs above national average. The weakness we saw in industrial was largely driven by some of the uncertainties around tariffs that surface in 2019. But as Steve said, we are beginning to see some signs of rebound in the specific customer circumstances and hope for a stronger 2020. Andrew Weisel : Okay, great. That's helpful. Then on the dividend, Steve, did I hear you say that you're targeting the low end of the 65% to 75% range in the outer years? Why would that be and why not the midpoint? Steven Young : Well, that's just where it tracks based on the assumptions we put there. We'll certainly monitor that as we go forward. It's nice to have the flexibility to look at the dividend as it gets to the lower end of the range, but we have that flexibility. So we're not committing to anything on that, but it's nice to be tracking in that direction. Lynn Good : And I think, Andrew, as we more solidly position the dividend within the payout range, our longer-term goal is to grow the dividend at the same pace of earnings. And this moderation we're experiencing here in the short-term will give us the flexibility to do that over the longer term. Andrew Weisel : Got it. Very good. And then if I could squeeze one last one in here. The earned ROEs in the Carolinas, you're guiding to a modestly lower return in 2020 versus the past few years. Is that primarily related to last year's reduction in the allowed ROE? Are there other factors there? I know it's tough to discuss in the middle of rate cases, but any kind of directional commentary? Steven Young : A couple of factors that come in, you -- as you build investment base for the upcoming rate case, you will incur some lag, as I referred to, and then you'll catch that up when you have a rate case. So some of those returns will move around depending upon rate case timing. And I think that's one of the factors to think about as well. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our time for questions and answers today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks. Lynn Good : Well, I want to thank everyone for joining the call today. We're proud of our accomplishments in 2019 and believe that the company is well positioned not only to deliver industry-leading service to our customers but also results -- strong results for our shareholders in the years ahead. We look forward to seeing you at our ESG Investor Day in May and also look forward to any follow-up questions that you have, our IR team will be available. So thanks again for joining us. Operator : Thank you. And again, that does conclude today's call. We thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Duke Energy First Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Bryan Buckler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Bryan Buckler : Thank you, Derek. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Review and Business Update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information within the meaning of the securities laws. Actual results could differ materials from such forward looking statements and those factors are outlined here in and disposed in Duke energy's SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found in today's materials and on Duke energy.com. Please note the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. As summarized on Slide 4, here in today's call, Lynn will provide an update on our response to COVID-19. She will also discuss progress on our strategic initiatives and the company's long-term outlook. Steve will then provide an overview of our first quarter financial results and share an update on key regulatory activities. We will also provide insights into our economic and growth outlook before closing with key investor considerations. With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Bryan, thank you, and good morning everyone. Let me open our call today by focusing first on our response to COVID-19, I know it is top of mind for all of you. First and foremost, our talks are with those who have been personally affected. I also want to express my heartfelt thanks to the healthcare and government workers, as well as those working countless hours to support for frontline professionals. This pandemic has their barriers that has permeated the globe, our country and the states in which we operate. It's altered our day to day lives from how we interact, the way we operate and serve our customers. But despite these dynamic conditions, Duke Energy and its employees have risen to the challenge, continuing to provide reliable service to our nearly 24 million electric and gas customers. The safety of our communities, customers and employees is our top priority and we took a number of steps to protect them. In March, we shifted nearly 18,000 team mates to remote operations. For team mates in critical roles who could not work remotely we deployed the best available personal protection equipment and create disinfecting between shifts initiated split operations, between primary and alternate locations to limit exposure, plus additional restrictions on those accessing our facilities and implemented social distancing policies. These new safety protocols were particularly important during spring storm restoration and generation outages. So far, our teams have completed three nuclear outages and more than 30 fossil hydrogeneration outages, all while maintaining focus on safety and delivering on time and on budget. And in mid April, our transmission and distribution teams quickly responded to more than 900,000 outages across the Midwest and the Carolinas after severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. But Duke Energy\u2019s response is on well beyond supporting our internal team. We were one of the first utilities in the country to suspend service disconnections for nonpayment and waive late payment and other fees for our customers. In addition, we donated approximately $6 million from the Duke Energy Foundation to fund relief efforts across our jurisdictions and provided critical PPE to several community organizations within our territory. We also accelerated the flow back of fuel adjustments and over collections in Florida, resulting in a 20% reduction in residential bills in May. And we are working directly with our commercial and industrial customers to provide a system with payment options for those most impacted by current economic conditions. Our employees have been steadfast in ensuring our communities have power as they also respond and adapt to these changing times. The collective work of the healthcare and government professionals, as well as utility and other essential workers demonstrates the power of working together to serve our communities. Now let me take a moment to walk you through Slide 6 that summarizes where our company stands financially during these uncertain economic times. Today, we announced first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.14 in line with our expectations but reflecting milder weather compared to normal and storm costs this winter totaling approximately $0.15 per share. We began to take cost mitigation actions in February as we saw the impact of the mild winter, and we are building on those actions to address COVID-19. Our communities are experiencing a slowdown and we are beginning to see the impact of electric load in our jurisdictions. In a few minutes, Steve will share more on these customer load trends focusing on the month of April, and range of potential load trends over the balance of 2020. We are presently projecting $0.25 to $0.35 reduction in revenue from COVID-19, which is consistent with stay at home policies for midsummer and a gradual economic recovery beginning in the third quarter and continuing over the balance of the year. In response to the pandemic and in recognition of mild weather entering the year, we are executing on a series of cost saving initiatives, totaling approximately $350 million to $450 million or $0.35 to $0.45 per share. We\u2019re also keeping our regulators informed about the specific thoughts we are incurring related to COVID-19. For example, a potential increase in bad debt expense, and we'll seek recovery of these costs at the appropriate time. Taking these measures into consideration, we are affirming our 2020 adjusted earnings per share guidance range of 5.05 to 5.45. We will continue to update you as we move forward. It's important to recognize that we are only two months into this event. We are and we will continue planning for a range of outcomes and we will know more if the economies that we serve reopen. The third quarter, which is our most significant one is also still ahead of us. Over the long term, we maintain our confidence in the strength of the communities we serve and in our ability to deliver on the $56 billion infrastructure investment plan, it is critical to our customers and communities. I will speak more to our business fundamentals in a moment. Turning to Slide 7, we remain committed to our long-term vision and value creation for our communities and our shareholders. We're putting our five year $56 billion capital plan to work as we generate cleaner energy, modernizing strength in the energy grid and expand natural gas infrastructure. Since announcing this updated plan in February, we've made progress advancing these goals. Last September, we announced our comprehensive plans to address carbon across our footprint, reaching at least 50% reduction by 2030 and net zero by 2050. Our updated climate and sustainability reports issued in April provide more clarity and detail around the measures we're taking to achieve these milestones, including doubling our renewables portfolio over the next five years. Our climate report outlines our plans over the longer term to retire more coal, further expand renewables, energy storage and natural gas. We also emphasize the importance of research and development, focused on those following carbon free resources. We believe these new technologies are essential to reach our net zero goal by 2050, and plan to share more updates in this area when we host our ESG day later this year. On the grid in April we filed our 10 year $6 billion Florida storm protection plan. These investments will generate meaningful customer benefits by enhancing reliability while reducing restoration costs and outage times associated with extreme weather events. Further, details on the progress we're making in these areas are outlined on the slide. Before I close, let me touch on the Atlantic Coast pipeline. You can reference a status summary on Slide 18 in the appendix. We expect a decision from the Supreme Court regarding the Appalachian Trail crossing in the coming weeks. We're also awaiting the biological opinion and incidental take statement from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service as their detailed analysis continues to ensure that a durable permit is issued. We expect the agency to reissue the permit in mid 2020, and to-date have not seen any significant delays in the progress of the work from COVID-19. Successful resolution of both of these items will be important to reach our construction. Importantly, ACP has finalized revised commercial term with the major pipeline off takers balancing value to customers and fair returns to project owners. Finally, we are also monitoring developments on the nationwide Permit 12. The recent decision related to the Keystone pipeline by the district court in Montana has potential implications to ACP. Just yesterday, the judge amended his April 16th ruling limiting the new oil and gas pipeline projects. He also denied a stay pending appeal. We're evaluating this ruling and the impact it will have on the existing timing and cost of the project. Assuming the issue is resolved in a timely manner and we can take advantage of the November through March pre-selling season, we believe ACP can maintaining existing schedule and cost estimates. We remain committed to this important infrastructure project and the economic benefits we expect to it will drive for our communities in the Carolinas, and we'll continue to update you as progress is made. As I reflect on our long-term strategy, I'm confident in our industry priorities. They continue to deliver value, capitalizing the complementary nature of our electric and gas franchises to meet our customers\u2019 growing and evolving energy needs. Looking ahead and in the context of the uncertain economic environment in our country, we will be thoughtful in the pace at which we deploy capital, balancing affordability for our customers with value creation for our investors. Turning to Slide 8, even in the midst of the economic impact of the stay home orders, the fundamentals of our business remain strong. Importantly, our employees\u2019 commitment to our customers and communities shine through during the hardest of time as we generate and deliver reliable increasingly clean energy across our service territory. There are several distinguishing factors that make our company an ideal long-term investment for shareholders. First, our size and scale and diversity of operations is unmatched, allowing us to deliver consistent short-term returns and long-term investment opportunities. Furthermore, we operate in constructive regulatory jurisdictions that oversee our operations in arguably the most attractive communities on the East Coast. And our five year $56 billion plan to address an cleaner energy grid improvement and other infrastructure that\u2019s critical to the customers and communities we serve, and will create meaningful shareholder value for many years to come. These are the strong business fundamentals that give us confidence to deliver on our long-term earnings growth rate of 4% to 6%. And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve. Steve Young : Thanks, Lynn and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a brief discussion on our quarterly results, highlighting a few of the key variances for the prior year. For more detailed information on various drivers and a reconciliation of reported to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials on the company today's press release and presentation. As shown on Slide 9, our first quarter reported earnings per share were $1.24 and our adjusted earnings per share were $1.14. This is compared to reported and adjusted earnings per share of $1.24 last year. The difference between reported and adjusted earnings was due to the partial settlement in the DEC North Carolina rate case permitting recovery of 2018 severance costs. Within the segment, the electric utilities and infrastructure was down $0.06 compared to the prior year. We saw the expected benefits from base rate increases in South Carolina and Florida, and higher rider revenues in the Midwest, along with forecasted regulatory lag in North Carolina. However, these fundamental improvements in our segment results were offset by mild winter weather along with severe storms that impacted much of the Carolina. Shifting to gas utilities and infrastructure results were $0.03 higher, driven primarily by new retail rates in North Carolina and higher margins at the LDC. These items were partially offset by the one-time income tax adjustment related to ACP, which favorably impacted the prior period results. In our commercial renewable segment, results were up $0.06 for the quarter. The increase was primarily due to ongoing benefits from projects brought online in 2019, as well as favorable wind resource and pricing this year. Finally, other was down $0.12 for the quarter, principally due to planned costs of borrowings and lower investment returns and non-qualified benefit plans causing an approximate $0.06 year over year difference. The returns on these planned assets especially rebounded for the month of April. Overall, our first quarter financial results were not materially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Aside from the unseasonable weather and related storm costs, the first quarter was consistent with our internal plan. Given the software weather, we began planning mitigation actions in February and further enhanced and accelerated those plans upon the full onset of COVID-19, which I'll describe in detail in a few moments. Turning the Slide 10, we continue to execute on a regulatory agenda. As Lynn mentioned, we recently filed our storm protection plan in Florida that provides much needed storm hardening in the state. We also have modernized regulatory mechanisms for investments in both Florida and Ohio that are providing timely recovery of our investments in clean generation and a more modernized grid. We currently have three rate cases underway Our Duke Energy Indiana case continues as planned. The hearings were held in January and the record is now closed, and we expect you order around midyear, the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy progress. The written pre-hearing record is substantially closed. In the DEC case, we reached a partial settlement for storm costs, allowing us to pursue securitization, as well as other adjustments. The hearings for both cases have been delayed. We continue to work with all stakeholders to identify options to safely and efficiently conduct the hearings, and we expect to revise procedural schedule to be released in the coming weeks. Just last week we filed with the commission a proposal to combine the hearings of the two cases in July, which is supported by the public staff. If this procedural schedule is approved, it will help to limit the delay in obtaining the general rate case orders. A slight delay in the decisions for both of the North Carolina cases is not expected to have a significant impact on our 2020 financial plan, and the commission has a variety of mechanisms that they can implement to help balance the interests of customers and shareholders. With regard to COVID-19 and expected impacts across our jurisdiction, we\u2019re attracting the financial effects on our utilities, including elevated bad debt expense and late fees for customers. This is an extraordinary time that has and will continue to require our utilities to incur costs on behalf of our customers and the employees we operate our business. Similar to what others are doing across the country, we'll work with our regulators to identify the best solution to recover these costs, to support the ongoing financial health of our utilities, while also recognizing the unique needs of our customers during this unprecedented time. Shifting now to our response to the COVID pandemic, Slide 11 highlights the well timed steps we've taken to bolster our liquidity and financial strength to position us to manage through a variety of potential outcomes. As of April 30, we have a strong available liquidity position of $8.2 billion, which provides the company valuable flexibility as we plan our remaining capital markets transactions in 2020. In addition, provisions within the recently enacted Cares Act provide meaningful cash benefits in 2020 by accelerating our remaining AMT credits of approximately $285 million into the current year. This additional cash benefit will help to mitigate lower revenues and give us added confidence in our ability to deliver our consolidated credit metric targets for the year. Finally, our 2020 capital and financing plans remains on track. We will closely monitor the capital markets and strategically time our issuances to achieve the best outcomes possible for both our customers and shareholders. Moving to Slide 12, in addition to our large size and scale, our retail customer mix is diverse anchored by our growing residential customer front. The south east remains a very attractive part of the company that continues to experience strong growth with new residential customers at a rate of approximately 1.7% year-over-year. With the recent sale and policies volumes in our residential customer class have been strong, particularly in Florida and we expect this trend to continue into the summer cooling season. The higher residential volumes provide a partial offset to declines in the commercial and industrial classes. Within commercial much of the service sector has been closed or limited operations, including schools and universities, bars and restaurants and other retail establishments. Certain sectors within commercial remain resilient, such as data centers and hospitals that continue to provide frontline services to fight against the pandemic. The temporary closures and curtailments of certain industrial customers are beginning to give away the plans to restart production as states in our service territories are relaxing stay at home policies and workers are preparing to come back to work gradually. Turning to Slide 13. As we compare build sales in April to the prior year, we're able to see how the full stay at home policies have impacted retail electric volumes across each of our customer classes. Commercial and industrial usage was down 10% and 13% respectively for the month. But as expected, the higher margin residential class was up 6%. Overall, retail sales were down 5% and these results are slightly favorable to our revised forecast for the month. As a reminder, the earning sensitivities do vary across retail customer classes and we've included those here for you. Looking ahead, we expect the 3% to 5% decline in total retail volumes for full year. We are forecasting the deepest declines in volumes compared to 2019 in both the second and third quarter with a gradual economic recovery beginning in the latter half of the third quarter and extending beyond the end of the year. With these forecasted ranges and on a weather normalized basis, we are forecasting a full year 2020 negative EPS impact of $0.25 to $0.35. As our communities are beginning measured reopenings, we're hearing from a large number of our industrial customers that they are planning to increase their level of operations in the mid to late May timeframe. At the same time, we expect higher residential volumes until stay at home policies are fully relaxed. Moving now to Slide 14, we've activated several initiatives to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19. Our annual non-rider O&M budget is nearly 5 billion, providing us with formidable lever to address revenue headwind. As I mentioned, we began our mitigation plans in February and have greatly expanded those efforts with the COVID-19 onset. Over the past five years, we have demonstrated a core competency in managing our O&M, absorbing increases for inflation as well as nearly 300 million of O&M associated with the Piedmont acquisition. We have also demonstrated the ability to strategically manage cost between years, taking advantage of strong earnings in some years to strengthened periods when expected costs rise. Based on the tremendous focus and commitment of our teammates, we are confident we can reduce our O&M and other expenses by approximately $350 million to $450 million in 2020. Our target is not merely inspirational but it's underscored with discrete actions for which we have had clear line of sight and are already taking action. For example, as our generating assets are expected to run less during the year, we are optimizing the timing and strength of our 2020 planned outages. In addition, we are aggressively managing all expenses, including our contract labor, overtime, nonessential projects and a broad range of discretionary spending. We are also suspending external hire, while sharing existing resources in a virtual manner in order to optimize labor costs. Let me clear, we are highly confident in our ability to deliver on this goal with $350 million to $450 million of 2020 cost reductions. Although, we are still early in the year, based on the forecast of a gradual economic recovery beginning this summer and the significant cost mitigation actions that we have put into motion, we are affirming our 2020 targets of delivery within our original earnings per share guidance range. Finally, we understand the value of the dividend to our investors. Approximately 40% of our retail investors and many of whom count on our dividend as a source of income during these uncertain times. 2020 marks the 94th consecutive year of paying a quarterly cash dividend. Throughout the past nine decades, including during the financial crisis to 2008 and 2009, we have protected our quarterly cash dividend. Our excellent businesses that operate in some of the best jurisdictions in the country give us confidence to continue paying and growing the dividend consistent with our long-term target payout ratio of 65% to 75%. Before we open it up for questions, let me turn to Slide 15. Our attractive dividend coupled with our long-term earnings growth from investments in our regulated utilities provided compelling risk adjusted return for shareholders. As a company, we're well positioned and confident our vibrant and growing communities will resume strong economic growth as we emerge from this pandemic. With that, we will open the line for your question. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : So the mitigation plan that was announced, how much of the $0.35 to $0.45 is sort of cemented and if COVID is more protracted in the current 3% to 5% low degradation. Do you have incremental levers? And I do have a quick follow up. Lynn Good : It's all start and Steve you can add. We have definitive plans for the $0.35 to $0.45 as well as upside potential. And I think at some point, depending on how this economic downturn plays out, we would continue to be more aggressively, not only the cost categories we've identified but really within a broader context of transformation. And this is where we'd be more aggressive around corporate center, around outsourcing, real estate footprint, digital tools, early plant retirement, just a variety of things and that work is already underway. So this is something that I'm particularly proud of is we've demonstrated the ability to understand our thoughts and cost drivers significantly over the last five years. We've also put infrastructure in place to drive transformation and the plans are underway for a range of economic outcomes. Shahriar Pourreza : And then just focusing on the element side of the 350 million to 450 million in mitigation plan. Can you touch on how much of this could be ongoing or perpetual in nature as you sort of think about the shaping of your O&M profile post 2020? Lynn Good : I would say, there will be elements of the cost reductions that are sustainable, and there will be elements that move with timing. So an example would be when you put a hiring freeze in play, we will enter 2021 with a lower headcount than we would have originally projected. And then we will begin bringing skills in at the appropriate time in case depending on the needs of the business. I think outages, because we're running our assets less, we've been able to defer some of those but we'll be thoughtful about maintaining assets that are important to customers and feather those back in as needed. We're also spending a lot of time on what we've learned around remote work, and the activities underway from COVID-19. And I believe there will be permanent savings from the way we are using resources. And we're trying to get our hands around quantification of that as we look at remote work policies and we look at our real estate footprint. And you can expect to hear more about that as we think about 2021 and beyond. Steve, would you add to that? Steve Young : I think Lynn hit it very well. I'm very confident that we're learning a lot through this pandemic about how to work remotely and how to use technology tools that we didn't really realize what we had. That will serve us well as we go forward. We\u2019ll couple that with digital capabilities that our business transformation center is utilizing and data analytics. I think we will be able to -- we have found a new avenue a new path of another body of efficiencies through what we're learning through this COVID-19 pandemic. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd : I wanted to touch this first on ACP. And I think we expect and I think many expect that you will be victorious at the Supreme Court. From there, I guess I'm thinking about the Montana litigation and potential impact in terms of decision to restart the project or ability to restart the project. I think there's a chance there that that litigation could be fairly extensive. How does that factor into sort of the decision making around restarting work on ACP? Lynn Good : Stephen, this is an important consideration. And as I said in the remarks, assuming that we can get this resolved to hit the preselling season we\u2019ll be in position to move forward, maintaining cost and schedule. Given the fact that that really happened yesterday, we\u2019re catching at for the very early time in our evaluation. We would expect the Army Corps and DoJ to appeal, and we'll be monitoring that closely as I know others will be in the industry and other infrastructure companies and we\u2019ll of course learn more from the Army Corps and DoJ to go forward. So it's something to keep on the radar screen and we'll continue to monitor and update as we learn more. Stephen Byrd : And so it is clearly relevant such as you're thinking about the overall plan for the project\u2026 Lynn Good : Yes, it\u2019s return from it. Stephen Byrd : And then maybe just a quick one on the credit statistics that you Steve that you\u2019ve laid out kind of your pretty clear path. I maybe sort of overthinking or just looking at the discussion here, in terms of the 15% FFO to debt level that you're targeting versus sort of the 15% to 16% level. Would you mind just touching again on dialog with rating agencies? Your overall sort of sense for where you want to be over the next several years in terms of your FFO to debt? Steve Young : Well, our targeted range for credit ratings is to have FFO in the 15% to 16% range. We\u2019ve taken steps to make that happen in our plan and in the past we have good dialog with the rating agencies. Moody's reaffirmed our rating, S&P pulled the entire sector onto a negative outlook. And everybody's looking at the impacts of this pandemic. So we'll continue that dialog. We're seeing some erosion in top line revenues and that affects FFO, but you can see the mitigation impacts that we have put in place that moves in the opposite direction. So we'll continue the dialog. We'll continue to work to meet our financial plans, both earnings and on the credit side. And a couple of things that are unique to us. We've got these AMT credits that accelerated monetization helps us quite a bit here. We're also taking advantage of deferring of a corporate portion of payroll taxes that's about $100 million cash flow benefit. Our pension plans are in good shape in terms of funding and so forth. And we're not a cash tax payer until 2027 in any significant way. So we've got some solid strength in our balance sheet that help us. And then the continued regulatory activity of getting recovery of costs is essential there. So we'll continue that dialog with the rating agencies, and we'll keep them abreast of what's moving forward. Stephen Byrd : And just lastly, if I could, just on the O&M cost control impressive results in terms of being able to cut costs. And it's an interesting point about sort of some of the learnings that you're engaged in. When you think about sort of the EPS growth guidance in the longer term that you've laid out in the trajectory. Is there a potential that some of these learnings that could last and be beneficial, could that have a meaningful benefit in terms of as you think about your overall trajectory? Or is it a little too early to say. How are you thinking about what you've been able to learn here? Lynn Good : Stephen, I think O&M agility and the ability to lower cost structure is a tailwind to growth, because it puts us in a great position to deploy capital without raising price to customers. And so, I do think about it as something that's important to the long-term growth of the company. Stephen Byrd : And it sounds like at least the portion of these cost savings are things that could be more permanent in nature and be beneficial longer term, whereas others things like outage timing are more transitory in nature, so it sounds like it's a mix of the two. Lynn Good : I think that's right Stephen. But I think it's important that you're hearing from us that lowering our cost structure is not only a core competency of ours but a strong objective. And we think particularly in the time we've got economic uncertainty to move early and aggressively is a smart thing to do, and that's how we are positioning ourselves in 2020 and also for 2021 and beyond. Steve Young : And we are learning techniques to utilize our workforce much more efficiently in this situation. We can virtually shift engineers within functions. We have shifted financial people from budgeting to accounting to audit services, IT people to different functions, the virtual capabilities as we learn more about them, are going to help us utilize our workforce more efficiently. And I think that's going to provide longer term savings capabilities. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolf Research LLC. Steve Fleishman : So just could you, if you don't mind, just remind us kind of the North Carolina rate cases, when you expect outcomes and just if that does get delayed further. How much do we have to worry about the timing of that exactly in terms of your range for this year? Lynn Good : So Steve we made a filing maybe a week ago, two days ago suggesting or recommending the consolidation of the two cases in the Carolinas supported by public staff, setting hearing in July of this year. And so we think the commission will give that look close consideration that will put us close to the timing we\u2019d originally planned. So we feel like we've got some flexibility within our financial plan for 2020 on that timing. I also think it's fair to say that there are tools with these cases, whether it's deferrals, accounting orders get back of deferred income taxes, interim rates, a variety of tools that could be used to support the health of the utility. And we'll be evaluating all of those considerations as we go and those tools, many of those tools are available to the commission as you know. Steve Fleishman : And any updated thoughts on whether you have control likely potential to settle those cases or expect them to be fully litigated to the end? Lynn Good : Steve, we've entered into a settlement on a handful of items in the DEC case we'll do have similar discussions on DET. And between now and July, we'll continue to keep lines of communication open with the parties to see if there are other opportunities. I think this is an important time as you recognize customers, of course working through the economic downturn but the health of the utilities are also extraordinarily important. And I'm not sure that there's another time when the essential nature of our services and underscored more than this. And so, we'll continue to have discussions, it's hard to forecast whether or not we'll get to any further settlement at this point but we'll keep you posted. Steve Fleishman : And then lastly, I think you mentioned that there's been the initial meeting and the North Carolina energy plan, or I think the initial meetings there. Could you just give color on where that stands and when we might start seeing any outcomes from that? Lynn Good : There have been two stakeholder work streams seen in 2021 focused on climate policy. So this is a group of stakeholders focused on retirement of coal, CO2 markets, clean energy standard. And they have continued to meet even remotely talking about these various items. We would expect a draft report from those discussions in the second quarter, public draft for third quarter and then a recommendation going to the governor by the end of the year. You may recall that the objective is to get to at least 70% carbon reduction by 2030, and it's actually greenhouse gas is not carbon. And so there are some alignment around base years and other things going on to figure out exactly how to do accounting. We're comfortable with this objective, as you know from our climate strategy where at least 50% by 2030. So, that stream of work is very engaged. They've also been to meetings on a stakeholder process focused on modernized regulations, performance based rate making and other tools. The discussion is early I would say just I think there was one meeting in person, one remote meeting. The objectives there are trying to find ways that carbon reduction can be incented, distributed energy resources. And so that is moving at perhaps a slightly slower pace but good discussion and dialog there as well. So I think on both of these, we'll have more feedback as the year progresses and determine whether or not there's any specific push coming out of either of these processes for legislation in 2021. Operator : We will next go to Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jonathan Arnold : Just a quick question on the guidance reaffirmation and the cost savings versus the pressure you see on plan. So is it reasonable to assume that where you're sitting today if those things play out as you've outlined, recognizing there's a lot of variability that you would be sort of solidly in the range or kind of holding in at the low end, or just any other color you can give us there? Lynn Good : We built a plan and are executing a plan that matches the COVID-19 expectation, as well as the first quarter weaker weather, which really gives us an opportunity to land solidly within the range. And as we've talked about, we have a track record of being able to manage O&M in this fashion and we have a high degree of confidence that we can do that. But we also recognize we're only a couple of months into this. The third quarter is still ahead of us. There are wide range of assumptions on how the economy is going to play out or states are just beginning to reopen. We have the milestones around Atlantic Coast pipeline that we've talked about with the decision and also the biological opinion. So we'll continue to update on all of these things as the year progresses. But the actions that we've put into place right now are designed to place us solidly within the range. Jonathan Arnold : And just one of the things, you talked about keeping regulators informed on incremental costs. Could you just sort of -- are you actually deferring certain items? And just where are you on to the deferrals and potentially orders out of commissions allowing you to do that? Lynn Good : For the first quarter, Jonathan, minimal impact, because we were just sort of starting into this process and the various policies with customers. But we are reporting and tracking all of these costs to our various commissions and we will begin to see filings around deferrals or accounting orders and other things. I think, Ohio and Indiana are already underway. And as we get more of that feedback going then we will reflect appropriate accounting entries at the right time. Steve, how would you add? Steve Young : We're preparing filings in the Midwest in Ohio and Indiana. We are tracking costs in all of our jurisdictions. And at the appropriate time, we'll make various filings and work with our regulators on appropriate deferrals. Nothing's being deferred at this point but applications are getting prepared, tracking is moving forward and we'll continue to look at this and see what makes the most sense. Jonathan Arnold : And how have you kind of treated that in guidance, I guess? Lynn Good : So Jonathan, we're assuming that we will get appropriate treatment of incremental costs. And I'm focusing on things like bad debt expense. The timing of when that occurs in terms of cash collections will depend on the jurisdictions. But for incremental costs, we are assuming that we'll get appropriate regulatory treatment. Jonathan Arnold : And then can I just [Multiple Speakers] have a topic. The recent executive order about not sourcing equipment from adversary nations. Do you have any initial thoughts at a high level on how this might impact your ability to execute plan on grid, for example? Just any color. And I realize it has to be defined but it seems to be [Multiple Speakers]. Lynn Good : We're closely following, Jonathan. I think the spirit of it is to address cyber risk, which is something we strongly support. There was a similar executive order issued formerly few years ago for the telecom industry and so we will factor in as we learn more. These plans into our investment plan. But as you know, making investments in T&D, intended to address cyber and physical risk as well as renewables and customer programs, all of that is squarely within our strategic investment plan. So we will adjust it as we learn more and applaud focus on cyber risk and around the bulk power system. Steve Young : And I would add that we have a broad supplier base across our footprint. As you said, Jonathan, there's more to learn as specifically being targeted here. But we look at our vendor base and try to diversify as much as possible so we can move in different directions if necessary. Operator : We'll next go to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So I know you addressed this in part, but I want to come back to it a little bit. How are you thinking about the sustainability of the cost cuts beyond the current period? Obviously, it's a dramatic number so it's not necessarily expected. But how do you think about the cadence of that against the need for perhaps evolving rate case timeline? And even within that number that you talked about this year as a follow up question. How are you thinking about that complementing your cost cutting efforts to mitigate impacts from coal ash, if that makes sense as well? Lynn Good : So I'll take a stab and Steve you can build on it. We had developed a plan to match what we see as COVID risk as well as mild weather. So you've got economic downturn as well as weak start to the year, and we've identified from a range of things operations, corporate center, employee expenses, hiring freeze, contractor contingent workers, over time variable compensation, a variety of tools that we will use to go after that. As I commented a moment ago, the fact that we're only a couple of months into this and learning about the reopening and learning about what might unfold over the balance of the year, we are also looking at each of those cost categories for potential upsizing of them, as well as moving into what I would call more transformative changes where we might look at real estate and early retirement of certain assets and so on. So there's a lot of planning going on because the future is uncertain. As I look at that range of costs, some of them will be sustainable. I\u2019m not prepared to give you a percentage or a specific number on that. But I do believe that some of them will be sustainable. The example I gave a moment ago, you know, hiring freeze is going to put us into 2021 with a smaller workforce. And we will monitor as we go how to convert to a sustainable lower cost structure if we find ourselves in a longer downturn. I think as you talk about things like coal ash, you\u2019re talking about regulatory risk, and the rate case outcomes and how that will factor in. We have a range of assumptions in our financial plan as we think about rate cases, and that is always part of our thinking in developing the size of mitigating actions. And so I won't point to a specific item on that, but I will say anytime you put a financial plan together, you're evaluating range of outcomes. We feel strongly that recovery of coal ash costs and recovery of returns is important. We believe it's important for any health of a balance sheet and we think about cost of this nature, and we will be prepared to strongly defend that when we're on the band later this summer. Steve Young : And I might add Julien that as we think about our regulatory cadences, the ability to generate these O&M efficiencies is a very useful tool here. It gives us headroom to make needed capital investments on behalf of our customers, as Lynn alluded to earlier, and minimize any rate impacts to customers. So this capital optimization around our O&M optimization in sync with the regulatory cadence is a very important part of what we're trying to put together. And we've got flexibility in the capital plan. So we can move that capital around to fit under O&M efficiencies to help our shareholders and our customers. So those are the types of dynamics we're trying to put together across our footprint. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And can I just follow up very briefly here. How you think about the shaping here by quarter of the cost cuts and how they manifest themselves, relative I suppose to the reduction in loans. It sounds like you were rapidly able to identify these cost cuts, such that as you think about 2Q and 3Q et cetera. And then Lynn if you can clarify, you specifically said that you did not yet elect, for instance, voluntary retirement programs as part of this $400 million number? Lynn Good : There is no assumption of a voluntary retirement program in the numbers, Julien. Steve Young : And then on the saving, Julien, look most of it to be in the second half of the year. A lot of all generation outage work will be in the fall generation season as our headcount freeze kicks in that kind of builds during the year we had budgeted increases in workforce. We'll certainly see some in each quarter of the rest of the year but specifically do the generation outage work that will be a bit more in the second half of the year. Operator : We'll go next go to Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Michael Weinstein : A couple of quick ones on CapEx and O&M, so as part of the grid hardening plan that you just filed. Is that already reflected in the five year CapEx plan, I think it is but just trying to confirm that? Lynn Good : So Michael, we updated in February about 1.5 billion into Florida, Florida five year plan and that is consistent with what we filed in the grid hardening plan. We will see incremental capital beyond the five years, because this is the 10-year plan and we\u2019ll provide those updates as the years progress. Steve Young : Our February capital plan was increased 12% and the Florida grid mark was a significant part of the increase. Michael Weinstein : And just to beat a dead horse on the O&M reduction. Is there a ballpark estimate that you could give us for how much is deferral into the plant maintenance and how much is more permanent 25% of this more permanent, maybe 50% permanent? Lynn Good : Michael, at this point, I don't have a range to share with you. I think that's been a topic of interest. And as we go into the second quarter and begin our more earnest planning for 2021, I think we'll be in a better position to talk about that. But our objective will be to make it much sustainable as we can in this environment but I don't have a specific on deferral versus the sustainable. Steve Young : And I think we want to look at how the assets operate and think about their performance under the revised operations and so forth, and where we're headed and that will impact it as well. Michael Weinstein : And related question, Steve you mentioned the idea that you have headroom for lower O&M, more capital improvements. Do you see the opportunity to convert some of these OpEx cuts and once the crisis is over and for higher rate base and CapEx growth plan? Steve Young : Well, we certainly always look at putting our financial plan together, keeping in mind impacts on customer rates. And so to the extend you can reduce O&M costs that does give you that headroom there. We have a robust data set of capital opportunities, we turn capital away each year when we go through our budgeting process. So doing our scope and scale the breadth of our grid we have plenty of opportunities to do those kind of things. Michael Weinstein : And also since the progress rate case is still has a record that's still open, is it possible to incorporate some of these further cost deferrals and recovery mechanisms or anything else you\u2019re thinking about that to incorporate that into that space? Lynn Good : So Michael, we're looking at the appropriate way to handle the Carolinas in light of the fact that the case have yet to get to hearing. I don't have anything specific to share on that plan right now, but we are reporting the costs to the North Carolina commission and to the state and to South Carolina and we'll make the appropriate filings and incorporate in the rate case if that makes sense or handle in whatever way make sense, just too early on that one. Operator : And we'll next go to Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Jeremy Tonet : I just want to come to the O&M side with a slightly different angle at that, if I recall, it seems like spending on such vegetation management was accelerated in 4Q \u201819. So just trying to think through how much cost savings is kind of banked last year that could be used against this year? And was any of that contingency kind of already utilized in the first quarter? Steve Young : In 2019, our agility programs worked in the other direction. We have a favorable year and we accelerated some useful expenses into 2019. We have veg managements is one area where we had about $0.04 that we pulled into 2019, as I recall, that was baked into our plans and our forecast and so forth. And the ability to do those kind of things is very useful to us. That's already baked into the numbers that you're seeing at this point. But that helps us achieve and get into our range that dexterity between calendar years. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our time for questions and answers. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks. Lynn Good : Well, thank you, Derek, and thanks to all who joined today for your interest and investment in Duke energy. And I just want to take this opportunity to thank the employees at Duke Energy, I'm extraordinarily proud of the work that underway, the new safety protocols to do the business as usual but also to serve our customers well. And the commitment of the leadership team and our employees to excellence for the customers and then maintaining financial health for our company is truly extraordinary. So, thanks to the Duke Energy employee and thanks to all of you for joining today. Operator : Thank you. And again that does conclude today's call. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Young - EVP and CFO Analysts : Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Kody Clark - Guggenheim Partners Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Jonathan Arnold - Vertical Research Partners Durgesh Chopra - Evercore ISI Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, good day and welcome to the Duke Energy's Second Quarter Earnings Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Bryan Buckler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Bryan Buckler - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you, Abby. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's second quarter 2020 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information within the meaning of the securities laws. Actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking statements and those factors are outlined herein and disclosed in Duke Energy's SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found in today's materials and on duke-energy.com. Please note the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. As summarized on slide 4, during today's call, Lynn will provide an update on our 2020 financial results and rate cases as well as the insights on the company's long-term strategy and investment outlook. Steve will then share an overview of our second quarter financial results. We will also offer insights into our economic and load growth outlook and long-term earnings projections before closing with key investor considerations. With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Bryan, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 for the quarter which is favorable to our internal projections including COVID. The decline in load during the quarter was less significant than originally anticipated with some of our states reopening and residential usage stronger than expected. Looking ahead and recognizing the uncertainties that remain, including the potential impact of a resurgence in the virus, we're maintaining our full-year projection of a 3% to 5% decline in retail volumes. We are also closely monitoring the pace of economic recovery and we'll know more as the year progresses. We made great progress in mitigating operations and maintenance expense. I'm very proud of our demonstrated track record in managing our cost structure over many years. But I'm particularly proud of the work of the team this year. We have identified and launched significant efforts to reduce costs in 2020 by $350 million to $450 million, matching the impact of mild winter weather, major storms and the pandemic. The quarter reflects a portion of those savings and we are on track to deliver the remaining savings over the balance of 2020. We remain steadfast in our 2020 financial commitment to shareholders and are reaffirming our full-year guidance range of $5.05 to $5.45. Through aggressive approach to cost mitigation, which began early in the year, we are positioned to navigate through the uncertainties of COVID and to absorb the loss of earnings from the cancellation of ACP. As Steve will discuss in a moment, our year-to-date results, along with the strong July, position us to deliver in the lower half of the 2020 guidance range. The third quarter, our most significant one, is still ahead of us and we will update expectations again during our third quarter earnings call. Let me also touch briefly on 2021. And in July, we announced the cancellation of ACP due to ongoing delays and increasing cost uncertainty which threatened the economic viability of the project. We are disappointed in this outcome, but believe the decision to cancel is in the best interest of our shareholders and our customers, and we are actively pursuing other infrastructure plans to support Eastern North Carolina as I will touch on in a moment. There's a lot to be excited about as we head into 2021. We will enter the year with 95% of our future earnings and capital allocation in our regulated electric and gas utilities. Our utilities serve some of the most attractive jurisdictions in the country and provide our investors with a transparent, low-risk capital plan and annual rate base growth of 6%. We will use every tool available to us to maximize 2021 earnings for shareholders and will remain steadfastly focused on delivering growth of 4% to 6% over the long term, grounded in our regulated jurisdictional businesses. Steve will share more with you in a moment regarding our 2021 outlook. Before I talk about a recent regulatory activity and investment strategy, I wanted to share an update on our ongoing response to COVID and the social unrest that has gripped our communities. We are nearly six months into the pandemic, an unprecedented event that has required us to create new solutions for our customers and employees. In short order, we've adapted our workplaces, shifted to remote operations where possible, created new processes for customer interactions and more, while keeping the health and safety of our communities and employees paramount. We've also maintained reliable service for our customers and quickly restored 350,000 outages across Florida and Carolinas as the result of the recent hurricane. Our employees continue to rise to the challenges associated with this pandemic, and I am so proud of our workforce's extraordinary response. And in the midst of the pandemic, our company and, indeed, the nation have been challenged by the killing of George Floyd and its aftermath. Issues surrounding racial equity and social justice are front and center, as they should be. A national movement has been ignited that demands much more than a debate. It deserves action. Our company is determined to work toward fair, responsible and practical solutions. Times like these remind me of the importance of our company's values. We believe deeply that having diverse backgrounds, experiences and skills allows us to serve our customers better, innovate and attract the talent we need to be successful. Now more than ever, we are relying on these values to cultivate a workplace rooted in diversity and inclusion. As we power the lives of our customers, we will also continue to advocate for change, stand up for justice, and ensure the communities where we work and live are provided with equal opportunities. Turning to slide 6, you can see that we've been active in the regulatory space over the past few months and are engaging stakeholders to reach balanced solutions for our customers. In late June, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission issued a constructive order in our base rate case, supporting our long-term investment strategy for the Midwest. As you will recall, we filed our case last July, marking the first case DEI filed in 16 years. We received approval for an overall base rate increase of $159 million or a 6.2% average rate increase. The rate increase, which is based on the modernized forward test year, will be implemented in two steps, with step one rates already effective, and step two rates will be implemented in Q2 2021, and then trued up with carrying costs to January 1, 2021. The commission ordered a 9.7% ROE and a requested capital structure of 53% equity. We were also pleased with the decisions on full recovery of and return on the historic coal ash costs and inclusion of the Edwardsport IGCC plant in base rate. Importantly, the commission approved shortened depreciable lives for our coal fleet, a key step in our transition to a cleaner energy future and consistent with the IRP we filed in 2019. Shifting to North Carolina, we recently reached constructive partial settlement in both our DEC and DEP rate cases. The settling parties include a broad group of intervenors from large customers to community groups and, most recently, the public staff, illustrating the focus our company places on stakeholder engagement. Key terms of the agreement with public staff include a 9.6% ROE and 52% equity component of the capital structure, along with deferral treatment and a return on approximately $1.3 billion in grid improvements from 2020 to 2022. The settlement terms are subject to approval by the North Carolina Utilities Commission with hearing set to begin on August 24. The delay in hearings provide sufficient time for the parties to review or update the capital and service data and other revenue requirement inputs through May 31. These changes will increase the annual revenue requirement request by approximately $70 million. And lastly, I'd like to point out our filing to implement interim rate changes for both DEC and DEP. These temporary rates are designed to protect our ability to earn on investments consistent with the originally requested effective dates, while avoiding a rate change for customers during this interim period. This innovative approach by our North Carolina regulatory team was made possible by utilizing the flow-back of excess deferred income taxes and ensures we maintain our financial strength as we make these investments. We look forward to sharing more updates on our North Carolina rate cases and other regulatory proceedings in the months to come. Now, turning to slides 7 and 8, Duke Energy's strategy to modernize and strengthen the energy grid, generate cleaner energy, and expand smart energy infrastructure across our footprint is underpinned by a robust five-year $56 billion capital plan, but also provides clear line of sight to tremendous capital deployment opportunities for our communities well past 2024. Our financial and capital planning process is underway, and we continue to see ample capital investment opportunities, including emerging infrastructure needs for the Piedmont Natural Gas system in Eastern North Carolina, ongoing grid upgrades and infrastructure to support economic growth, and renewable expansion, and additional solar investments in Florida and the Carolinas. We're also finalizing our work on the Integrated Resource Plan in the Carolinas, the IRP, which we will file in early September. In the IRP, we will outline alternatives to achieving our carbon reduction goals as well as the North Carolina governor's executive order to achieve a 70% reduction by 2030. This IRP filing follows a comprehensive stakeholder engagement process, which work to identify the best potential paths forward to achieve carbon reduction targets, while also balancing reliability and affordability for our customers. We are also engaged in a separate stakeholder process led by the state of North Carolina focusing on establishing a clean energy plan for the future. We see this engagement and our IRP filing as complementary, and we believe they will serve as foundational elements in our investment planning over the next decade. Retirement of coal plants and investment in replacement generation coupled with investments in battery storage, the energy delivery system, energy efficiency and demand side management, will underpin the state's transition to a cleaner energy future and Duke Energy's investment plan for customers and shareholders. We look forward to sharing more with you as the year progresses. This line of sight to an extensive runway of investment opportunities in the Carolinas as well as our other states gives us confidence to deliver on our long-term rate base growth rate of 6%, not only through 2024, but into the next decade. As I reflect on 2020 and where we're headed, Duke Energy is very well positioned. Time and again, we adapt, innovate and deliver, creating value for customers and shareholders alike. As we continue to respond to the pandemic, we are looking to the future and executing on our long-term plans, advancing a smarter energy future for our communities. I hope you'll join us for our inaugural ESG Analyst Day on October 9 to learn more about our Carolinas IRP filing, long-term strategy and specifics of it (00:12:17) around the environment, social issues, and governance. We've included more information on slides 27 and 28 in the appendix, which illustrate our strong progress on transitioning our generation portfolio to carbon-free resources, including renewables. These are important topics, and we look forward to further discussions with you at the ESG Day. With that, let me turn the call over to Steve. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a summary of our quarterly results highlighting a few of the key variances to the prior year. For more detailed information on earnings drivers and a reconciliation of reported to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. As shown on slide 9, we reported a second quarter loss of $1.13 per share and adjusted earnings of $1.08 per share. This is compared to reported and adjusted earnings per share of $1.12 last year. The difference between the reported and adjusted earnings in the current period is due to the cancellation and write-off of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Within the segments, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure was down $0.08 quarter-over-quarter. Weather was the primary driver given it was $0.08 favorable in the prior year and closer to normal this year. We also had higher depreciation and amortization expense as we continue to grow our asset base. And as expected, electric volumes were down across each of our service territories due to the pandemic. However, these headwinds were offset by significant cost mitigation, base rate increases in South Carolina and Florida, and higher rider revenues in the Midwest. Our Gas Utilities and Infrastructure results were $0.01 higher driven by new retail rates in North Carolina as well as cost mitigation. Our LDC gas businesses continue to produce outstanding results, contributing $0.09 in growth in 2020. The Commercial Renewables segment was also up $0.01. The increase was primarily due to benefits from new projects brought online this quarter. Finally, Other was up $0.03 for the quarter, principally due to lower income tax expense and higher investment returns in non-qualified benefit plans. Overall, we are very pleased with the results in the quarter. We took swift action to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 and weather on year-to-date results, and this dedication across the entire enterprise has positioned us well to deliver in the lower half of our 2020 earnings guidance range despite the loss of $0.13 of earnings from ACP. As we think about earnings drivers in the second half of the year, we expect solid growth over 2019 from new base rates in Indiana, North Carolina, Kentucky, and Piedmont as well as continuing benefits from our Florida multiyear rate plan and SoBRA investments. Our impressive cost mitigation efforts in the quarter have created momentum that we will build on during the remainder of the year. We are also pleased to see July results coming in favorable to our plan. We had a very warm month with strong operational performance, and July sales volumes continued to trend favorable to our post-COVID expectations. We expect lower retail electric volumes as well as lower ACP earnings of $0.13 to partially offset these growth factors. Moving to slide 10, while our second quarter retail electric volumes were down 6%, this was favorable compared to our original post-COVID expectations of a 9% decline for the quarter. There were a few favorable trends that we continue to watch. First, we have experienced strength in the residential sector across our service areas in excess of our original expectations. In addition, our commercial and industrial volumes are recovering reasonably well with nearly three-fourths of our largest C&I customers resuming operations. Adding to these data points, July 2020 weather-normal volumes were also favorable by 3% to 4% compared to our COVID-updated forecast. Residential volumes were particularly strong in July, up approximately 6.5% compared to July a year ago. As we look ahead, we are still watching the pace of the economic recovery across each of our service territories and we'll adjust our expectations as we learn more. Our volume expectations for the full year continue to be a retail decline of 3% to 5% with earnings headwinds of $0.25 to $0.35. While our recent results have been favorable, this is clearly a dynamic situation and one we will closely monitor. In the midst of the pandemic, we continue to see strong customer growth across each of our jurisdictions. Year-to-date, we've seen a 1.7% increase in new electric customers and 1.5% growth in gas distribution customers. Beyond organic movement into our attractive service areas, we continue to proactively seek out and support economic development. Even with the current economic challenges and uncertainties, multiple corporations have announced decisions to locate new facilities or expand existing facilities within our service territories. They've not only committed significant capital investment, but they've also committed to expanding jobs in our communities. For example, Centene, a Fortune 50 company, announced a new East Coast regional headquarters and technology center in Charlotte with plans to invest approximately $1 billion and create 3,200 jobs over the next 12 years. This marks one of the longest \u2013 largest economic development projects in North Carolina's history. As we continue to see more population migration into our desirables service territories, we believe Duke Energy's long-term load growth fundamentals will be some of the strongest in the industry. Moving to slide 11, we've made tremendous progress across the organization to identify and implement substantial cost mitigation initiatives. I'm extremely proud of the collaboration and focus of our employees and management team to deliver on our 2020 shareholder earnings commitment, despite the significant headwinds we've discussed. We set an aggressive cost mitigation range of $350 million to $450 million in 2020. We began to tackle this by re-scoping and delaying some generation plant outages, making risk-informed decisions about the best schedule moving forward. Additionally, we are retraining and redeploying our own workforce to perform projects historically executed by contract labor and taking advantage of natural attrition. With regards to employee expenses, we have paused any travel that is not business critical, and moderated all discretionary spend. On a year-to-date basis, we have already achieved $170 million in cost reductions, representing 40% of our full year target. We will build on this momentum and are confident in our ability to reach the high end of the range if necessary. Cost mitigation, the ability to respond quickly to unforeseen circumstances has become a core competency of Duke Energy. Our operational teams and industry-leading business transformation group continually utilize our digital and automation playbook to turn many of these changes in work practices and even lower cost structure to benefit future years. We will share more on this front in the coming months as team makes further progress on their work. Let's move to slide 12. Here, I'd like to provide some early considerations for 2021. Prior to the cancellation of ACP, we built the financial plan that was trending toward an EPS midpoint of approximately $5.50 in 2021. Included in this projection is a $0.35 contribution from ACP. The math, therefore, points us to around $5.15 and our regulated utilities Commercial Renewables operations remain on track for 2021. We will be refining this 2021 earnings estimate as we move through the rest of the year, considering regulatory proceedings and our analysis of economic conditions. We believe that 2021 electric load will be impacted by longer-term economic impacts of COVID-19 and we expect to manage our O&M costs to offset this impact as, we have in 2020. Although we cannot immediately replace the ACP earnings, we have identified the incremental capital projects across our businesses that will provide growth over the five-year period. We will reset our earnings base in 2021 and deliver growth of 4% to 6% from our low-risk regulated capital investments over the long term. We will provide 2021 earnings drivers in November and the earnings guidance range in February along with an updated five-year capital plan. As Lynn mentioned, we will use every tool at our disposal to maximize shareholder value in 2021, and our strong 6% rate base CAGR will provide a transparent low-risk platform to 4% to 6% long-term EPS growth off of that 2021 base. Turning to slide 13. Our strong balance sheet underpins our $56 billion capital plan. After we announced the cancellation of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, both S&P and Moody's maintained the current rating and stable outlook at the holding company. Our stable outlook is supported by our $500 million DRIP and ATM program in 2020 through 2022 and a proactive $2.5 billion equity offering that was priced last November to mitigate all potential impacts of ACP. We believe this amount of equity is adequate to support our balance sheet and capital plan. Finally, we understand the value of the dividend to our investors. This year marks the 94th consecutive year of paying a quarterly cash dividend and the 14th consecutive annual increase. The recent increase of 2% is consistent with our strategy to grow the dividend, but also moderate our payout ratio within a sustainable range of 65% to 75%. Finally, let me wrap up on slide 14. Our attractive dividend yield, coupled with our long-term earnings growth from investments in our regulated utilities, provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for shareholders. We are well positioned to manage through COVID-19 and remain confident in our ability to deliver in the lower half of the earnings guidance range in 2020, overcoming significant headwinds, as we expect to enter 2021 with one of the most valuable and low-risk shareholder investment propositions in the industry, and we look forward to sharing more with you in the coming months. And as Lynn mentioned, we look forward to sharing more details about our ESG vision and long-term strategy during our ESG Day on October 9. With that, we'll open the call for the questions. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our first question from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, Steve, Lynn. How are you doing? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Good morning. Hey. Great. Can you talk about some of the main things that you're looking at that will affect the 2021 guidance and how you're thinking about rebasing at 4% to 6% going forward? Like right off the bat, everybody can see the impact of ACP is definitely a factor; COVID-19, how long that lasts is a factor; maybe the coal ash settlement or coal ash proceedings, that's probably a factor. How do all these things weigh in your minds right now as you're thinking about 2021? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Sure, Mike, and I appreciate that question. I think it's on everyone's mind and we really worked hard in our remarks and with our slide today to give you some visibility into what we're thinking about. I think there are three important points that I would emphasize here. First of all that the regulated and commercial renewables businesses remain on track. And I think what's important there as we talk about rate case outcomes, or coal ash recovery, et cetera, we always plan for a range of outcomes that was contemplated in the projected $5.50. It's also contemplated in the projected $5.15 that Steve walked you through the math on. The second important point is that we are committed to mitigating COVID economic effects as we did in 2020. We don't yet know how much they're going to be. We're looking at a range of economic forecasts, but our commitment is that the declining load would be offset with O&M. And then the third thing I think is important is we've already begun to identify additional capital projects that will fill in the roughly $2 billion that had originally been planned for ACP, and we've reflected a few ideas for you on slide 12. So, we're trying to give you the sense, this is the visibility, this is what we're looking at, regulated utilities on track, COVID to be mitigated, capital plan intact. And so, over the balance of the year, we'll continue to monitor what's going on with the economy. We should receive orders from the NCUC on the pending cases. We're also going to be closely following the IRP and clean energy plan resolution and feedback because those two initiatives represent opportunities for us to continue to identify capital that we'll spend over the next five years and the next decade. So, we will give you more visibility on all of these things in the third quarter, including drivers, and then, of course, the complete capital cash flow earnings range in February as we historically have. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Hey. One more on coal ash. If you were to receive, let's say, some moderately negative order on coal ash or a negative order on coal ash, would that require any additional block equity issuance or secondary equity? I know you've said that you do not need it for ACP cancellation. I just wanted to confirm. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Sure. And I \u2013 this is an important question and will really be the centerpiece of testimony on the implications to credit, Mike, of coal ash recovery. I talked about the earnings implications contemplated in our plan. But on cash flow and metrics, we will be on the stand August 24 talking about the importance of a strong balance sheet, importance of our customers, not only for growth, but for potential disruptions in the market, the fact that the customers lean on our balance sheet during hurricanes and COVID and other things. And our hope and expectation is that, given the magnitude of this issue to Duke and the fact that we have a very strong, well-reasoned order from 2018, that we'll receive fair and appropriate treatment from the commission on this item. The North Carolina Commission has been constructive over many years and we will put a very strong case in front of them. But I think it's important to focus specifically on coal ash. And if we were to receive an order consistent with Dominion, and absent any other provisions within the order that would be credit supportive, our balance sheet would be weakened. And Moody's has been very clear on the treatment of coal ash; if there's no return, it would be a direct reduction or deduction from FFO to debt. And frankly, we believe there are no viable options to address over a 100-basis-point impact to FFO to debt, which is basically the impact that that ruling would have. It's too big to solve with equity issuances. It's too big to solve with operational responses. And I don't say this lightly. We don't want this outcome. We don't think it's in the best interest of customers or the state. And I can never speak for the agencies, but I think the consideration will not only be the quantitative math I just walked you through, but the qualitative assessment of, is this order constructive and is the downgrade threshold for Duke at the appropriate level? So we look at this as an important issue, as I said, a centerpiece of our testimony in August. We have reached a settlement with the state on the method of closing. We saved customers' money. We're meeting all the deadlines. We're delivering consistent with the rules and regulations, and our hope and expectation is for a constructive order. As you noted in your comments about equity, we believe the amount of equity in the plan is adequate to support our capital and our balance sheet. And that's the way we're approaching it at this point. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. So, just to be clear, it doesn't sound like you'd be inclined to issue additional equity, even in the event of some kind of a negative order on coal ash recovery. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Mike, we will evaluate the whole of the order, because I think it'll be important to look at what else is in the order, are there any other credit-supportive elements. But we stand by the equity that we've included in our plan is adequate to support our credit and our capital plan. And we don't believe that equity will solve a potential quantitative and qualitative assessment on coal ash. So, as I said, we'll put a strong case on. We expect and hope for fair treatment from the commission, and we'll continue to keep you posted as we move through these proceedings. Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, Lynn. Thank you very much. And I'll cede the floor. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Kody Clark - Guggenheim Partners : Hey. It's actually Kody Clark on for Shar. Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Morning. Kody Clark - Guggenheim Partners : So, just to follow up on the last question, just wanted to get a better sense of the moving pieces here. I know you aren't in a position to give 2021 guidance, but given your capital spending guidance, no need to raise equity yet and healthy rate case outcome in the Carolinas, upcoming filing in Florida, O&M levers and additional projects in lieu of ACP given your gas needs. Is there any reason to believe that when you issue that 2021 guidance that it would imply growth lower than the historical midpoint, 4% to 6%? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: So, what we are pointing to in the analysis is we were targeting $5.50. ACP is worth about $0.35. So, the math points to about $5.15, and that implies the reg business and commercial renewables on track, implies it will offset any economic deterioration with O&M, and also implies that we'll continue to rebuild that capital from ACP, So, that's the way I would respond to it. Steve, would you add anything to that? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Our rate base is growing at 6% for our businesses. So, I think we're going to robustly grow in 4% to 6% range, hopefully, with potential at the high end of the range from where we reset in 2021. Kody Clark - Guggenheim Partners : Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then, quickly looking forward to the ESG Day, do you plan on providing the incremental long-term capital spending opportunities associated with the Carolinas IRP at that point or will you wait for the full capital plan update in February to roll in any CapEx? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: I believe February is going to be better timing for that. And the reason is the IRP is filed in early September. The clean energy plan reaches its natural resolution in the form of a report to the governor at the end of December. So, I think what we'll be able to do is share some of the scenarios within our IRP, what the capital would look like in those scenarios with the impact to customer rates. And it will have everything from meeting at least a 50% carbon reduction to a 70% carbon reduction, which is the target that the governor has set in his executive order. But I think to fully reflect all of that in our capital plan 2021, February will be a start. And I think we'll even learn more beyond February as the process continues here in the Carolinas. And I do think that fleet transition is something that represents an opportunity for us to add capital in the Carolinas that Steve referenced just a moment ago, and we'll keep you informed along the way as we know more. Kody Clark - Guggenheim Partners : Great. That's all I have. Thank you and stay safe. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you, you too. Operator : We will take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good morning to you. Thank you for the time. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a quick \u2013 hey. Good morning. Just wanted to follow up as a clarification of the capital spending plan and how it reconciles with IRP. I know you list out a few potential items here offsetting ACP, but that doesn't necessarily hit at the wider potential transition of the portfolio that you might be getting at in the IRP. So, one, if you can discuss the scenario of the IRP? And two, how that might reconcile with the revised $56 billion CapEx plan? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Julien, it's a very good question. And then what we've shared with you on slide 12 for incremental investments really does not contemplate the full potential from the IRP and the clean energy plan over the next decade. And so, the scenarios that we just talked briefly about in the slide deck, I'm kind of flipping here, it's slide 8, we believe we'll accelerate realization of clean energy by accelerating coal retirements. It will have a range of replacement generation options including, of course, more renewables and battery storage. It'll present an at least 50% carbon reduction, which I think has been our goal across our system, certainly here in the Carolinas as well. It'll also present what's necessary to get to at least a 70% carbon reduction. So, those three transition opportunities are not fully reflected in our capital plan. But they will be as we know more and as we align more specifically with the policy that will be finalized here over the next year, and we'll update you as we go. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. And just can you clarify some of those scenarios that you talk about over the next year, what's the timeline to getting clarity here, if I can ask you just a step further? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: So, we will take a stab at this, Julien, in February with our updated capital. But I would expect when a clean energy plan report is issued at the end of December, it's going to take a little time for that to find its way in terms of ongoing policy, is legislation necessary, is the commission going to be involved. Our IRP, similarly, will start to get reaction from it. We've been in stakeholder processes, but it will be filed in September. And so, I think it will take a little bit of time to feed those ideas and turn that into a more definitive policy. And we'll take a stab at it in February, but continue to build on that because what we're really talking about is a decade of investment through 2030 and then beyond. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. All right. So, the clarity is, 4Q, you're going to give us a first stab at it. But after that, it remains ongoing and potentially expansive. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: That's right. I think that's a fair way to think about it. Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hello, Steve. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, Lynn. Just a follow-up question on the coal ash issue. You mentioned in your rate order other credit-supportive elements. Aside from getting a return on it, like what \u2013 have you proposed other credit-supportive elements? Like, what might those be? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: I think it's cash flow, Steve. We've reached the settlement at 9.6% and 52%. I think it would have to be higher than that. And there's accelerated depreciation which is the cash flow element. So, I think it would be a combination of things, but we feel strongly about the recovery of the return on and of the coal ash. We received treatment in that regard in 2018, as you know, but I'm just providing that feedback to, say, any time you get an order from the commission, you have to look at the whole of it to evaluate implications, and we'll do exactly that. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Great. And then on ACP, in terms of just thoughts on how you're actually going to replace the gas \u2013 not the CapEx, but the gas that you needed \u2013 do you have \u2013 when will we know more about that? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Sure. Steve, we've been working on contingency plans for some time for both the LDC, so this is the Piedmont system and the need to get more gas and more pressure into the eastern part of the state. There are a range of options. We'll be looking at the lowest-cost option for customers. And we believe some capital expansion will be necessary to achieve that's what's reflected on slide 12. For the electric business, the IRP will be the first step in that process. There's been planning along the way, but the implications to replacement generation will be \u2013 begin to be addressed in the IRP. And there also will be weighing cost, completion risks, a variety of options that would be available to support the electric business. I think we talked about the fact the gas supply into the Carolinas is currently constrained particularly in winter. So, we'll need to look for ways to address that over time. And as we finalize these options and the considerations, we'll talk more about them. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Great. And then one last question. In the slide in the appendix where you showed kind of your long-term renewables goal, I think, of doubling by 2025. Could you just give more color, like how much of that has to come through the North Carolina, the Carolinas IRP processes, or assumption for that? Or are you assuming maybe you get half of what's bid there? Or is it coming from Florida commercial or areas like that? Just a little more color on that number. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Yeah. And Steve, that is based on historic IRPs. The Florida plan, the CPRE in the Carolinas, it includes some additional renewables, but we would intend to update all of that following the IRP and further work. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Right. I think there's significant renewables that come on the regulated side to CPRE and in Florida, and we're also including renewables that we cook up and just purchased from as well in the Carolinas as part of that number, because we're an important part there. And in the commercial business, we got through our five-year plan, about $2 billion of capital, and that represents landing about 300 megawatts a year. So, that's a piece of it as well. But I think there's a lot of renewables potential continuing in Florida and the Carolinas. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: And I think, Steve, this represents what we included in our climate report this year. It did not fully contemplate what we're seeing in the IRP and the clean energy plan. So, we will update this as we know more. Steven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Michael. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I hope you guys are doing well. I have two questions. One about Florida, one about the Carolinas. In Florida, do you see the potential to significantly upsize amount of megawatts or gigawatts of utility-scale solar that you built in Florida? I mean, if I compare your program relative to the other really large utility in the state, the size and scale differences are dramatic. It didn't know if there was something physical about the different systems that drive that difference in between their rolling out 10 gigawatts over 10 years and you're doing a dramatically smaller amount. That's my first question. My second question is, what role does offshore wind play in North Carolina \u2013 or in both Carolinas, and how will you know whether offshore wind is a component of your investment strategy? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Yeah. So, Michael, let me take Florida first. So, what we have shared with you in Florida is only a five-year plan. I mean, there's a site plan in Florida that gives some more visibility. But I would think about us as working within that five-year period, giving you more specifics. We are well on our way to the 750 megawatts that we announced a year or so ago... Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: A year and a half. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: A year and a half ago. We've also recently announced a Clean Energy Connection plan for another 750 megawatts. And as you look at the growth that Steve Fleishman was asking about a moment ago, there's over 1,000 in total in Florida over that five-year period. I do think there will be more renewable opportunities in Florida. And so, we will continue to update as we see more potential and as we roll out a different additional programs on behalf of customers. We are in a multiyear rate plan that will finalize at the end of 2021, Steve? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yes. At the end of 2021. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: So, that would be another opportunity for us to provide updates on capital and so on. So, I think renewables will continue to be a story in Florida. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: And I would add, part of our growth plan in Florida was the Citrus County combined cycles and that was two very large combined cycles that went into service. So, that influenced the amount of solar that we needed during this period. I think as we go forward, we'll be ramping up the amount of solar that we're putting in place, as Lynn alluded to. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: And Michael, on offshore wind, I think we will address offshore wind in the upcoming IRP. And where we think it might fit into the portfolio, I would think about it as something that probably has greater potential toward the end, to the next decade. You may remember the history here in the Carolinas, there was a wind moratorium, so no wind through the end of 2019. So, it hasn't had as much visibility as I think it will coming through this IRP and the clean energy process. So, it represents a future investment opportunity and we'll know more as this policy gets finalized and as we make further progress on the fleet transition. Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research. Jonathan Arnold - Vertical Research Partners : Hi. Good morning, guys. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Hi, Jonathan. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Morning. Jonathan Arnold - Vertical Research Partners : Just tying a couple of these things together, Lynn, do you think of the fleet transition and investments related to it as something that extends your runway or pushes you better within the 4% to 6% sort of trajectory that you're talking to us about or potentially even higher than that? Just curious, are there other things that you've dialed back a little bit on and just if you could speak to that. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Jonathan, I think it does both. It certainly provides a long-term runway because you think about \u2013 we're talking about fleet and fleet means long term. So, we're underpinning generation in the Carolinas for decades. But I also think it has the potential to impact this five-year plan to provide more investment opportunities, and we'll always look at investments within the context of price to customers because it needs to maintain \u2013 we need to maintain affordability. And so, I do think it has the potential to influence both periods. One of the great things about the expertise that we've developed on cost is that gives us headroom for capital. And we think about ongoing reduction of our cost structure as a way to continue to add capital for the benefit of customers. So, I would say, it helps both things. Jonathan Arnold - Vertical Research Partners : Great. Thank you. And then, Steve, you gave a little bit of a \u2013 sort of more of a July view of how residential load was tracking. Could you share a little bit more sort of up to the minute report out of C&I as well? Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: Yes, we continue to see C&I below. Again, in July, we saw residential higher than last year's July, by 6.5%. But we still saw the drops in commercial and industrial compared to last year in the magnitude of the low-double digits, and that led to \u2013 overall, we were about 1.5% below last year's July. So, that was boosted by the residential, obviously. We had projected to be about 5% below last July, all in. But we were better than that primarily driven by residential. So, we still saw a decline in commercial and industrial from last year. Industrial is climbing out of things. They're starting operations. As I mentioned, three-quarters of the larger customers are back in operations, some of them not fully at 100%, but they're working their way there. Smaller commercial's hurting a bit more. But overall, we're still tracking better than what we had initially forecasted, and we'll keep an eye on it month by month. Jonathan Arnold - Vertical Research Partners : So, those down 13% to 15% (00:47:51) numbers you gave us for Q2 are a little bit more low-double digit toward the end of the \u2013 beyond the end of the quarter, effectively, but still double digits kind of comp. Steven K. Young - Duke Energy Corp.: I think that's correct. I don't have the C&I in front of me here specifically, but they're obviously pulling down from the residential being up. So, I suspect they're still down a fair amount. But again, the larger C&I are coming up. And overall, it's less of a negative impact than we had seen again in July as we saw in the second quarter. We'll keep an eye on it. We're projecting improvement particularly in the fourth quarter. So, we'll see how the second wave impacts the economy as we go forward. Jonathan Arnold - Vertical Research Partners : Great. Thank you. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you, Jonathan. Operator : And we will take our next question from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore IS. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Good morning. Durgesh Chopra - Evercore ISI : Hey. Good morning, Lynn. Thank you for taking the question. Just maybe just where Jonathan left it off, this is small, but your last communication was lower of the 2020 guidance and now you're saying in the lower half. So, am I right in assuming that you're trending higher than perhaps you were a few weeks ago? Am I sort of understanding that correctly? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: That's correct. That's correct. So, it's really built on the success of the cost savings we've been able to generate rapidly as well as the strength that we saw in the month of July, not only on whether-normal volumes, but on weather, because you may recall, Durgesh, we had a very mild winter weather that was dragging us early in the year. And we've seen some moderations of that weather impact on hot summer. Durgesh Chopra - Evercore ISI : Understood. Super helpful. And then just broad strokes, Lynn, and I appreciate more detail on the CapEx plan to come, but broad strokes, as you think about you sort of filling the ACP CapEx hole, if you will, fair to assume that the timing of that and recovery of that CapEx, specifically slide 12, that is backend-loaded of the five-year plan? Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: I would think of it maybe ratably, because as we think about the incremental LDC investment, we'll get started as soon as we can and we'll work towards completing it. So, I would think of it kind of ratable, perhaps beginning as early as 2021. On the Florida solar investments, we are in front of the commission actually today. We reached a settlement August 4 with OPC on that, and we will begin introducing that investment as soon as possible after commission approval. And then I would also think about incremental investments in the grid, whether in the Carolinas or other jurisdictions being ratable as well. Durgesh Chopra - Evercore ISI : Got it. So, ratable broadly speaking for the five-year period. Understood. Thank you so much, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Thank you. Operator : And at this time, I would like to turn the call back to Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks. Lynn J. Good - Duke Energy Corp.: Well, thank you, and I appreciate everyone's interest and participation today. We look forward to further discussions with you. And as always, the IR team is available for any clarification following today's call. So, thanks again for joining us. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, once again, this concludes today's call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to the Duke Energy Third Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time I would like to turn the conference over to Bryan Buckler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Bryan Buckler : Thank you, Savanna. Good morning everyone and welcome to Duke Energy's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Review and Business Update. Leading our call today is; Lynn Good, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer; along with Steve Young Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information within the meaning of the securities laws. Actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking statements and those factors are outlined herein and disclosed in Duke Energy's SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found in today's materials and on duke-energy.com. Please note that the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. As summarized on Slide 4 during today's call Lynn will provide an update on our 2020 and 2021 outlook. She will also share insights on the company's long-term strategy and clean energy investment plans. Steve will then share an overview of our third quarter financial results. We will also provide updates on our economic and load growth outlook, progress against our 2020 mitigation targets, an update on our 2021 earnings drivers and Duke Energy's long-term capital investment plan. With that let me turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Bryan thank you and good morning everyone. Today we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.87 for the quarter favorable to the third quarter of 2019 by $0.08. These results were driven by higher earnings at our electric utilities from rate case activities, strong O&M and other mitigation actions and growth in our Commercial Renewables business. I am very proud of our workforce for their consistent focus on reducing costs and driving efficiencies to offset a number of headwinds this year while continuing to provide outstanding service for our customers. And a recent example is Hurricane Zeta. I want to give a special thanks to the men and women who just this past week responded with outstanding restoration services after the remnants of the hurricane caused significant damage in the Carolinas. Despite the challenges presented by 2020, our team remains focused on serving our customers with excellence. We've also made great progress with our mitigation actions to offset the impacts of COVID delivering $0.35 of benefit through September. As Steve will speak to in a moment, we now expect to deliver full year earnings benefits of $0.40 to $0.45. We will use our size and scale to carry many of these efforts into next year a continuation of our successful track record in these areas since 2015. With the third quarter behind us, we are narrowing our full year guidance range to $5.05 to $5.20. We have successfully offset the impact of COVID load and costs, weather and storms including Isaias and Zeta with exceptional cost management, giving us confidence that we can deliver results within this range for 2020. With ACP behind us, we are well positioned to deliver in 2021 as well and are pointing to a solid $5.15 with upside potential. We continue to finalize our business plans for the year ahead. And consistent with our typical practice, we will provide complete guidance including detailed capital and financing plans in February. Our confidence in our ability to deliver results goes well beyond next year. We expect to deliver at the top end of the 4% to 6% range through 2024 grounded in our robust investment plan to deliver cleaner energy and sustainable value for our communities and our industry-leading cost efficiency programs. We shared our vision in the significant runway of growth potential during our October 9th inaugural ESG Investor Day. During the event, we outlined the investment opportunities we are pursuing to support our goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. And while we are already an industry leader in carbon-free generation we have near-term ambitious plans to double our renewables portfolio by 2025, deploy energy storage across the Carolinas and Florida and extend the licenses of our nuclear fleet all to the benefit of our customers and communities. To support this work, we increased our 5-year capital plan to $58 billion and outlined a robust $65 billion to $75 billion capital plan for the 2025 through 2029 period. This incremental capital drives our earnings-based CAGR from the 6% level, we shared with you in February to progressively higher levels. We now expect a 6.5% rate base CAGR through 2024 and growing to a 7% rate base CAGR by the end of the 5-year planning period. As we move forward our path is underpinned by strong governance collaboration with stakeholders and most importantly developing our people and fostering a culture rooted in diversity and inclusion. I'm incredibly proud of our work and this foundation in 2020 gives us confidence as we close out the year and move through the next few years. Turning to Slide 6, we're advancing our clean energy strategy and building momentum in the states we serve. We operate in attractive jurisdictions that are considering various policy changes to support cleaner energy futures for our communities. We are partnering with stakeholders in each state to find solutions that accelerate carbon reductions, while also balancing customer affordability and the financial health of our utilities. In North Carolina, the governor's Clean Energy Plan process is well underway, and we along with many stakeholders are in the midst of constructive policy conversations. The pathways we outlined in our IRP, serve as fundamental pillars, demonstrating what it will take to achieve the objectives outlined in the Clean Energy Plan. In addition the detailed analysis in our filings is informing carbon policy discussions. We recognize our leadership role in decarbonizing the state in the robust thoughtful portfolios we've shared to help shape the path forward. The carbon policy discussions will be summarized in the report to the governor by year-end. We are also advancing the process around the IRP itself. We've shared the IRP with dozens of stakeholders, ensuring we received feedback from a wide variety of interest groups. The approach and modeling we used in the filing add a new level of transparency and sets a standard for how to collaborate and seek input. We anticipate hearing for the first half of 2021 in North Carolina and look forward to working with stakeholders to define the best pathway to reduce carbon emissions. We are also advancing the IRP in South Carolina, with a hearing expected in April and a decision from the commission expected in June. This will allow us to have more clarity about how our proposed portfolios integrate into the state's policy objectives. Also in South Carolina, we've reached multiple milestones with stakeholders. We received commission approval of our EV infrastructure pilot in September and reached a settlement agreement on net metering with solar developers. These developments highlight South Carolina's commitment to a cleaner energy future. Turning to Indiana, we are actively engaged in the state's 21st Century Energy Policy Task Force, which is focused on transitioning the state's generation mix and integrating renewables, while ensuring high levels of reliability and resiliency. Their findings will be compiled into a report due to the general assembly by December. This work builds on the advances we made as part of our 2019 IRP and 2020 rate case, where we received approval to reduce the average remaining depreciable lives of our Indiana coal assets by approximately 40%. And in Florida, the Clean Energy Connection and solar-based rate adjustment programs underpin our commitment to renewable energy. A hearing on the Clean Energy Connection proposal is scheduled for November 17. If approved, we would launch a $1 billion shared solar program, which includes 750 megawatts of renewable resources. We've received strong support for our proposal from a broad range of stakeholders and look forward to the outcome of the hearing. We're also making headway on the SoBRA investments with nearly half of the 700 megawatts of utility-scale solar installed. This also represents $1 billion investment in the state. We understand our integral role to lead the clean energy transition will strengthen and modernize the energy grid, increase our investments in renewables and new technologies, and advocate for energy policy and regulatory mechanisms that align with industry best practices and shareholder expectations. This is an exciting time for our company and our communities and we look forward to making meaningful progress on the clean energy transition in 2021. Before I move to the next slide, let me make a brief comment on the elections. I know some results are still being counted with final results a few days or weeks away. But what I do know is that there is strong bipartisan support for investing in critical infrastructure, driving economic growth and job creation for clean energy and resiliency investments. Our capital plan offers meaningful solutions to these and other needs of the communities we serve. I want to congratulate Governor Cooper on his reelection and thank him for his leadership of North Carolina. We are proud to be headquartered in North Carolina and look forward to working with his administration and the incoming members of the General Assembly. I also want to congratulate Indiana Governor, Holcomb on his victory. Indiana has a bright future as we transition our generation fleet and make critical investments in the grid. We welcome the opportunity to continue engaging with the governor and the general assembly in Indiana as well as all of our jurisdictions in which we operate. Before turning it over to Steve, let me reiterate our value proposition. We operate in premium utilities across the Southeast and the Midwest. And our service areas continue to benefit from strong growth as new residences and businesses move into our service territories. We are positioned to deliver 95% of our earnings from lower-risk regulated electric and gas utilities, and our growth profile was driven by our robust five-year $58 billion capital plan. The past year has made our great company even stronger and more agile and we look forward to a strong finish to 2020 and to carrying our momentum forward into future years. Our clean energy vision is transforming Duke, providing clear benefits to our customers and to our investors. For this reason, we are confident in our ambitious investment plans and our ability to deliver the top end of our growth range. And with that, let me turn the call over to Steve. Steve Young : Thanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a summary of our quarterly results, highlighting a few of the key variances to the prior year. For more detailed information on earnings drivers and a reconciliation of reported to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. As shown on slide 8, we announced third quarter adjusted earnings of $1.87 per share, compared to adjusted earnings of $1.79 per share last year. Within the segments, on an adjusted basis, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure was up $0.06 quarter-over-quarter, driven in large part by rate case activity in North Carolina, Indiana, Florida and Kentucky that contributed $0.07 in the quarter. Earnings also benefited by $0.08 from our industry-leading mitigation efforts, which I will speak to more in a moment. Lower tax expense and contributions from our wholesale contracts also contributed to our favorable results. Weather came in slightly above normal this quarter, but represents an $0.08 headwind this year when compared to the third quarter of the prior year. We also had higher depreciation and amortization expense as we continue to grow our asset base, and as expected electric volumes were down due to the pandemic. Our Gas Utilities and Infrastructure results were $0.05 lower, primarily due to the cancellation of ACP. Our LDC gas businesses continue to produce outstanding results, contributing $0.01 of growth in the quarter and $0.09 year-to-date in 2020. The Commercial Renewables segment was up $0.03, largely driven by new projects brought online this quarter including the 200-megawatt Rambler solar project in Texas. Finally, Other was favorable $0.05 for the quarter, principally due to lower income tax expense and financing costs and higher investment returns in nonqualified benefit plans. Overall, we are very pleased with our year-to-date results. We took swift action to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19, weather, storms and the loss of ACP earnings. And this dexterity has positioned us well to deliver in our narrowed 2020 earnings guidance range of $5.05 to $5.20. Moving to slide 9. Our third quarter electric -- retail electric volumes were down 2% compared to the third quarter 2019, which was slightly favorable, compared to our original post-COVID expectations of a 3.5% decline for the quarter. And while several volumes were better than anticipated, the improved customer class mix was more heavily weighted to C&I customers and less to residential. And thus the EPS impact was mostly in line with our expectations for the quarter. Despite the continuing effects of COVID-19, the economies in our jurisdictions have shown a level of resiliency with approximately 85% of our largest commercial and industrial customers resuming operations by September. While the pandemic's effect on the economy still bears close monitoring, we are updating our full year COVID load forecast to a decline of approximately 2% to 3% in total retail volumes compared to our previous estimates of a 3% to 5% decline. This revised load forecast equates to approximately $0.20 to $0.25 of earnings per share impact. And when coupled with waived fees and non-deferred COVID costs results in COVID related earnings headwinds of $0.25 to $0.35 in 2020. In the midst of the pandemic, we are encouraged by the strong customer growth across all of our jurisdictions. Year-to-date we've seen a 1.8% increase in new electric customers and 1.9% growth for our LDCs. As we continue to see more population migration to our desirable service territories, we believe Duke Energy's long-term load growth fundamentals would be some of the strongest in the industry. Let's move to slide 10, where I'd like to highlight our strong progress on achieving our 2020 financial commitments despite challenging headwinds. We have faced impacts from COVID and the cancellation of ACP, as well as unfavorable weather and significant storms including Hurricane Zeta, which came through the Carolinas in October. Time and again Duke Energy has demonstrated the ability to pivot, mitigate impacts and advance our strategic investments for short and long-term value creation for customers and shareholders and 2020 is a prime example. As I've highlighted many times cost mitigation and the ability to respond quickly to unforeseen circumstances have become a core competency of Duke Energy. On a year-to-date basis we have achieved approximately $350 million in mitigation, representing approximately 75% of our full year target and we are highly confident in our ability to deliver $400 million to $450 million of earnings benefits for the full year. These efforts position us to mitigate a large portion of the headwinds we've experienced in 2020 and deliver earnings within our original narrowed guidance ranges. With that let's move to slide 11. We have a strong outlook for 2021 and our significant investment opportunities serve as growth drivers for the year ahead. In Florida, we will continue to recover our grid investments through the third base rate increase in our multiyear rate plan. We also expect growth from additional solar projects recovered under the solar base rate adjustment mechanism. And starting in 2021, we expect to begin delivering grid invest -- improvement investments to our Florida customers under our Storm Protection Plan approved earlier in the year. In the Carolinas, Indiana and Kentucky we will have a full year benefit of the new base rate adjustments that went into effect earlier this year. Also in Indiana and Ohio we'll continue to invest in transmission and distribution upgrades that are recovered under our rider programs that drive consistent earnings growth each year. Additional drivers in Electric Utilities and Infrastructure will come from load growth and O&M management. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to see impressive increases in our number of our customers and that along with the continued recovery of the economy is expected to lead to an overall uplift in margins in 2021. Our current estimate of load growth off of 2020 is approximately 1% to 2%. We continue to monitor the pace of economic recovery and we'll provide an update in February. With respect to O&M and other mitigation actions, some of the tactical efforts that we are achieving in 2020 are not sustainable beyond the current year. And thus we expect a modest uptick in O&M costs in 2021 as compared to 2020. Revised timing and scope of outages is an example of mitigation efforts not sustainable year-over-year. Nonetheless our operational teams and industry-leading business transformation group are in the process of utilizing our digital and automation playbook to turn some of these initiatives into even lower cost operational model to benefit future years. We will share more on this front in the upcoming months, as the team makes progress on their work. Shifting to the gas segment. We expect to see a full year benefit from our Tennessee rate case filed this year as well as our South Carolina rate stabilization adjustment that was recently approved by the commission at a 9.8% ROE. Additional growth in the LDC business will come from customer additions and our integrity management investments, which are recovered through riders and provide steady predictable earnings per share growth year-after-year. Our Commercial Renewables segment will be largely flat to slightly negative in 2020 given our strong performance and delivery of completed projects this year. Our plan continues to target an annual net income of $200 million to $250 million through the five-year plan. On the financing front, we expect to settle the $2.5 billion equity forward by the end of this year, which will result in approximately $0.13 of dilution net of holding company debt interest savings. As stated during our second quarter call, with these drivers and ongoing COVID uncertainty, we expect to rebase our long-term earnings per share growth rate off of 2021 with a midpoint initially pointing to $5.15. We believe this is a solid number with upside. We are close to finalizing our 2021 through 2025 financial plans. And we will provide complete detailed guidance in February as we normally do. As Lynn mentioned, we have great confidence in delivering at the top-end of our 4% to 6% earnings per share growth rate through 2024, underpinned by our $58 billion capital plan and industry-leading cost reduction program. As we discussed on ESG Investor Day, our clean energy transition will drive significant growth for at least the next decade. As you look at slide 12, the left-hand side of it has the evolution of our five-year capital plan over the past several years. And on the right-hand side we show the expected growth in our earnings base. As you will recall our five-year capital plan just 1.5 years ago was at $50 billion. This past February, we increased the plan to $56 billion to address pressing infrastructure needs of our communities, including more renewables on our system and grid improvements. Here in the later half of 2020, it's become evident that the cleaner energy transition of our jurisdictions will necessitate additional capital deployment resulting in our current five-year capital plan of $58 billion. Looking to the second half of the decade we estimate a five-year capital plan of $65 billion to $75 billion. We've made some assumptions here about the amount of renewables investment Duke Energy would be able to rate base as those details have not yet been determined. As I mentioned at ESG Day under any IRP portfolio chosen in the Carolinas, we will have a significant role to play in the clean energy transformation in the two states. We believe the assumptions included here are very reasonable based on what we've seen around the country and within our service territories. This $65 billion to $75 billion capital plan for 2025 through 2029, includes clean energy generation and transmission investments across the Carolinas, Indiana and Florida, as well as an estimate of the distribution investments that will be required to enable renewables, battery storage and other distributed energy generation on our system. Our confidence in the growing rate base over the long-term is rooted in these strong capital plans. Our rate base grows from $77 billion in 2019 to roughly $105 billion by the end of 2024. That's a 6.5% earnings base CAGR. For the latter half of the decade, you see that growth accelerating to 7% with significant investments to enable this transformation. Our broad strategy also balances the need for investments with affordability for customers. As we transition out of coal, we expect to have lower fuel costs and non-fuel O&M costs and we will continue our business transformation modelings in pursuit of efficiencies across our footprint. Finally, we operate in the states that are experiencing strong customer growth, particularly, in the Carolinas and Florida, which also helps keep customer rates competitive. Finally, let me wrap-up on slide 13. Our attractive dividend yield coupled with our long-term earnings growth from investments in our regulated utilities provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for our shareholders. We are well-positioned to manage through COVID-19 and are confident in our ability to deliver in the narrowed earnings guidance range in 2020 and in our ability to achieve the top end of our 4% to 6% earnings per share growth rate off of the 2021 base. We expect to enter 2021 with one of the most valuable and lower-risk shareholder investment propositions in the industry and we are positioned to deliver sustainable value into the future. We look forward to speaking with many of you next week during the EEI Conference. With that, we'll open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead. Stephen Byrd : Hi. Good morning. Lynn Good : Hi, Stephen Steve Young : Good morning. Stephen Byrd : I wanted to follow-up Lynn, you gave a great update of the, sort of, the clean energy transition and I thought slide 6 encapsulated it pretty well. And I just wanted to explore the Carolinas a bit. You lay out on this page the -- in North Carolina the report to the governor by the end of the year, and then in both states you have IRP hearings. You've laid out pretty clearly sort of the trade-offs of different approaches to your future energy mix. How do you anticipate sort of the decision-making process evolving? Do you see, for example, sort of heavy direction from the Governor in these cases, or is it more sort of a collaborative hearing process where many constituents are going to weigh in? And then, ultimately, it's sort of a more of a commission-driven decision? How do you kind of think about where you're headed there? Lynn Good : Sure. And, Stephen, thanks for that question. I think the Governor has been very clear about his expectations in the form of his executive order that set a target of a 70% carbon reduction by 2030. He has been directing the stakeholder process throughout 2020 through his Cabinet Secretary Regan to oversee it. And I would say that that stakeholder process has been a robust one, broad range of people involved and has made significant progress over the course of the year, identifying and aligning around common goals. So transitioning the generation fleet over time, developing regulatory mechanisms that would incent that transition. And so, I also believe that kind of points to broad support for critical infrastructure investment, that will drive jobs and economic development, of course, achieve carbon reduction and achieve resiliency for the state. So I believe the next steps on this will be a shaping and updating of energy policy in North Carolina. If you look historically about the way that has happened Stephen, it's always been led by stakeholders coming together to achieve common goals in a bipartisan way. Governor, of course, weighing in with his expectations, stakeholder shaping the way to get there. And we see that process maturing in 2021 and expect that we, of course, will play a pivotal role in implementing that energy policy in a way that meets all of these objectives. I think the IRP is very complementary to that stakeholder process, because it puts in front of the commission a variety of options on how those policy objectives could be achieved. And we would expect a review by the commission and, of course, any input or feedback that they would have. And I think the combination of both of these processes will give us more clarity in 2021 on how we will move forward. But I would emphasize, again, the alignment of stakeholders to achieve common objectives has always been the foundation of movement on energy policy in North Carolina and we would expect the same to be the case here. Stephen Byrd : That's very clear. And, I guess, at a high level, looking at this page, you kind of have a lot of at-bats in terms of the possibility of additional capital spending. And I just want to make sure I was clear. Let's say that Duke is fortunate enough to have the opportunity for even more renewable spending, EV spending, whatever it might be. Just a refresh, in terms of your thinking of incremental CapEx and how you would finance that incremental CapEx. Lynn Good : And so, Stephen, as you know, we put some incremental CapEx in the five-year plan really underpinned by what we're seeing here in this generation transition. We have not changed the financing plans that we shared with you in February. We continue to plan to issue DRIP and ATM equity in 2021 and 2022. As we get to the back end of that five-year plan and really build the momentum to accelerate rate base growth, I would expect for us to have a modest level of DRIP/ATM equity in the plan. We think that coupled with cost mitigation, regulatory support and other elements that drive cash flow, would balance the needs of shareholders and creditors. So we will provide that complete update on financing in February, but your mind should go to the modest DRIP/ATM level as we think about the way we underpin this growth investment going forward. Stephen Byrd : Understood. So if I'm sort of thinking about this correctly, then you're already sort of thinking about some incremental CapEx, which you've described before. I mean, these hearings and these processes are going to take a while anyway. So it's not as if it's an immediate impact to your financing needs and some of that was already sort of factored in. So, it feels like, even if you get good responses in these states, at first it's going to take a while for that CapEx to actually transpire. Secondly, some of that was sort of already contemplated. And so, it's not as if we're like to see a fairly significant change to your plans, i.e., not massive new additional equity needs over and above what you've already laid out? Lynn Good : That's very fair, Stephen. If you -- on the slide that Steve walked you through, we updated capital from $50 billion to $56 billion in February. And that financing plan underpins that $56 billion, which is really the foundational element of the spending. With additional $2 billion and then ramping to $65 billion to $75 billion towards the back end is where we'll really be focused on your question initially. And we will be updating that. We should be thinking about the modest DRIP in ATM as the first place we would go to support that accelerated growth toward the back half of the planning period. Stephen Byrd : It\u2019s very clear. It\u2019s all I had. Thank you. Steve Young : Thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Lynn Good : Hi, Shar. Steve Young : Hello, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Hey. Good morning, guys. Lynn Good : Good morning. Shar Pourreza : Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions here. First around the $5.15 number for 2021. Obviously, this is sort of a worst-case outcome as we think about coal ash, et cetera. And I know you talked -- you'll talk a little bit more about it in February and you have some drivers in the slides. But maybe you can provide a little bit of a sense on some of the incremental items that could put you higher than that $5.15. There's a lot of moving pieces here. Shar Pourreza : Sure, I'll point to three things that we're watching, and then Steve can add to it. COVID load, we're continuing to look at what does load growth look like into 2021. Is there a second wave? Are there more economic shutdowns and so on, or does the economy bounce back more strongly? As we've said in the second quarter, and it continues to be our profile, we intend to offset COVID impact with O&M, so that we lessen the impact of that. But understanding where that economic forecast is, and how that matches up with cost would be something that we're watching. Maturing our cost management productivity to see how much of these savings that, we've been able to drive out in 2020, can continue into 2021 that work continues. We will start the year with a lower headcount. We have used technology in different ways. We dispatch crews in different ways. There have been so many opportunities and we're looking for ways we can create even more sustainability. That represents a potential item. And then of course rate cases, we have set the $5.15 to absorb the Dominion outcome on coal ash, and we will learn more toward the end of this year early next on the DEC order in particular. We will also hear from the Supreme Court we believe in 2020 on the prior rate case. So those are a couple of other things that we are monitoring. But we have \u2013 as I look at 2021, there is so much clarity. We will have all of this behind us the uncertainties that have been a challenge for us. And we're excited about the ability for the utilities to demonstrate the growth we know they're capable of, without ACP, without rate case overhang, without coal ash et cetera. And so we believe, there is incredible opportunity in 2021, and then growth beyond. So, Steve would you add anything to that? Steve Young : Yeah. The only thing, I might add is that, we'll look to see the impact of the customer growth. We're seeing the highest customer growth numbers we've seen in several years in the Carolinas and Florida. So perhaps that can give us a pickup as well. Lynn Good : Some of these New Yorkers, Shar, are coming down to New Jersey. Steve Young : Come on down Shar. Shar Pourreza : I'm on my way. I'm on my way. Lynn Good : Okay, good. Good. Shar Pourreza : And then obviously, you highlighted the Supreme Court pushed out the ruling until December 11. Can you just maybe Lynn with that delay talk a little bit about sort of the settlement strategy? How do you think discussions are going? Are they more or less constructive? And you've been obviously very vocal of the impact of not earning a return on the expenditures. Maybe it would be just helpful to refresh our thoughts as we think about credit metrics, and how we should think about potential equity or not in view of the Dominion order. Lynn Good : And so, Shar let me go to the last part of the question first. And that is, if we do receive the Dominion order from the NCUC, we do not intend to issue equity to cure the impact of a difficult rate order. So that is the headline answer to that question. I think we will wait to hear from both of these parties, the Supreme Court and the NCUC on coal ash in December early January. I do not expect that, we will be reaching settlement on coal ash. I think all parties are interested in hearing what the court and commissions have to say. But as I've said many times, we believe that coal ash is a recoverable cost, the NCUC does as well. We also believe that we are entitled to earn a return on costs that are collected over a long period of time consistent with the precedence of rate making in the state and also consistent with the requirements of strong credit for the utility. So we will await this ruling later this year. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then just lastly on \u2013 just a follow-up on Stephen's question around the alternative regulation group, it sounds like it's going to mature in 2021. Do you sort of anticipate a bill forming in 2021? And then just remind us like a bill that sort of enacts potential ROE bans or PBRs, does that sort of really act to minimize some regulatory lag, or could that be sort of incremental or accretive to your current growth trajectory or the profile of how you're guiding on growth? Lynn Good : Those are good questions, Shar, and I do believe that legislation could spring from this clean energy process and the recommendations coming out of the report, to not only set some parameters around transition of the fleet, but also those regulatory reform changes that you're talking about. The objective of the regulatory reform would really be to incent and enable the energy policy in the state. And to the extent, it reduces regulatory lag it is good. It is good for customers. It is good for investors and that will be an objective, as we talk about, the way regulatory reform would play out. I think about grid investment in particular. It's so important to this transition. And grid investment needs a different regulatory model than what we have here in North Carolina, and there's a lot of good discussion going on about that as part of these processes. Shar Pourreza : Got it. congratulations guys. Have a good morning. Lynn Good : Thank you, Shar. Steve Young : Thank you, Shar. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Go ahead. Michael Weinstein : Hi, guys. Lynn Good : Good morning. Steve Young : Hello. Michael Weinstein : Hey. On the \u2013 is the upside for $5.15 in 2021 is that only applied to 2021? In other words would you intend to keep the base at $5.15, even if you were able to find some savings for next year? Lynn Good : I think we'll cross that bridge when we jump to it Mike. I appreciate that question. I do feel like we've got a lot of uncertainties behind us. We've got a clean picture for 2021, but just like any business here you have things to tackle. We're tackling COVID and O&M and we're also working to progress the Clean Energy Plan. So, Steve, would you add to that in any way? Steve Young : You're right. We don't have that specificity now, but whatever we anchor to we're going to have a growth trajectory from that point forward that I think is going to be very clear in -- throughout the period that we're projecting forward on. Michael Weinstein : Certainly, the rate base growth is there to\u2026 Lynn Good : Yes. Correct. Investment growth is clear. Steve Young : That's correct. Lynn Good : Yeah. Michael Weinstein : And Steve, when you were negotiating after the tax -- the tax rate reductions a few years ago when you were negotiating with regulators to keep cash flows intact, what would be the outcome of a higher tax rate going forward? Do you think there will be room for additional FFO-to-debt improvements there if such a thing were to happen going forward? Steve Young : Yes, I think that would ultimately happen. What you'd see here if you saw an increase in the federal tax rate people have talked about moving from 21% to 28%. It would just move in the opposite direction of what we did in 2018. You would see the holding company tax shield be more beneficial to the tune of $0.05 or $0.06 per share at the operating company levels. Once enacted the higher tax rate, we would start deferring the additional income tax expense. And then we'd work with regulators on increasing the rates to reflect the increase in the tax expense, which is the opposite of what we did back in 2018 through 2020. And now that would result in an increase in cash flow and would help FFO there. We estimate that type of impact would be in the neighborhood of 2% to customer rates, but they've seen larger decreases as we've implemented the 2018 Reform Act. So, I do think it provides cash flow benefits in that fashion. Michael Weinstein : Great. Thank you very much. That's all I have now. Thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you, Mike. Operator : Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team. Lynn Good : Hi, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thanks for the time on you all. Hey. First a solitary question. Just wanted to see -- I haven't heard anything strategic here. But following media reports in recent weeks and months anything you can offer on strategic remarks? I'll just leave that open-ended. And then I've got some more substantive questions if I can. Lynn Good : And so Julien, are you talking about market rumors on M&A? Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah. I just wanted to see if there's anything that you would offer on that front, because no one's asking thus far. Lynn Good : Okay. All right. I'm sorry. Yeah. So building on your comment about strategic things for the company our focus is on the strategy of clean energy transition. It's on the strategy of building the stakeholder support in the Carolinas, as we move forward on regulatory reform and infrastructure investment. And so our focus is on driving that organic growth which we're -- we believe is extraordinary not only in terms of rate base investment, but customer growth and thriving jurisdictions. So that's what I would say our focus is on Julien. And we feel like the future is bright, as we've laid out here and we'll continue to build on as we give you more insight in February. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: No, I appreciate that. Just wanted to make sure. All right. So back to perhaps more substantive measures. Perhaps as you think about the transitioning here from the Clean Energy Plan and the reports of the governor, what pieces are resonating as best you can tell thus far with that stakeholder group? And I know we're still a few weeks away, but as you would in an attempt to try to capture the preponderance of different views here what are those regulatory buckets for reforms that are still on the table versus perhaps those that may be less relevant today? If you can try to capture that if you don't mind. Lynn Good : Yes. It's a good question Julien, because a lot of things have been discussed. And I think it's been a good exchange of information, feedback, education, points of view being shared. I think at the top level the regulatory reform is really focused on, how can we incent the development of this critical infrastructure and the associated reduction in carbon, so things like multiyear rate plans are being discussed, decoupling is being discussed. And we believe there's a lot of interest in those types of tools in order to move this forward. Performance-based rate making would be another thing that I would point to because you can tie achievement of certain outcomes to performance-based rate making. So those are the things, I would point to at this point. And as the processes continue you may recall there are two pieces; carbon policy in one, regulatory reform in the other. Carbon policy will find its way to the governor's desk by the end of the year. Regulatory reform will also be kind of wrapping up in that time frame. And as we reach critical milestones, we'll update of course along the way. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Sorry and just one quick clarification if I can. With respect to your confidence on costs that maybe differ, do you think you'll be able to earn at your authorized ROEs in the Carolinas going forward even with this Dominion order? Lynn Good : Yes. So if you look at our track record on earning our allowed rate of return, Julien, it's been very good. And we expect to be able to earn at our allowed rate of return going forward. Steve, would you add to that? Steve Young : Yes. I think absolutely we've got a long history of utilizing various levers whether it's O&M cost controls, expanding wholesale sales just working -- optimizing our regulatory schedule to earn our allowed return on our growing rate base. And so we'll continue to employ those tools as we go forward regardless of any particular rate outcome. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right, exactly. All right. Perfect. Thank you, guys and best of luck. Lynn Good : Thank you, Julien. Operator : Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman : Thanks. Good morning. Lynn Good : Hi, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Hi, Lynn. So just a little bit more follow-up on North Carolina. I think you did mention that you kind of work well with both sides of the aisle. I think the governor won Democrat, but the Legislature State Republican. Just in thinking about trying to turn these working groups into a law, how much is that going to be a challenge in 2021? Lynn Good : Steve, I would say that historically energy policy in North Carolina has moved in a bipartisan way. And the benefit of having diverse stakeholders together is you have voices from the business community, from the manufacturing community, from low income, from the environmental constituents. You've got the administration at the table as well. And I believe critical infrastructure focused not only on environment, but on job creation has a durability or an appeal to both sides of the aisle. And I believe we'll play a role in working with both sides to bring that intersection together. So we approach this with great optimism and enthusiasm from the alignment we've been able to be a part of in 2020 and we'll keep the conversations going. Steve Fleishman : Great. And I guess outside of getting legislation, can some of these potential changes be implemented without that just by the commission directly at the state level? Lynn Good : It's interesting. Steve, if you look at the IRP, we've got everything from a base plan to the more aggressive early retirements of coal and so on. That base plan can be executed immediately because it's within the regulations in North Carolina. It has renewable investment. It has storage investment and a variety of things. So there's a lot that can be done without any changes. I think as we look at some of the more new technologies like offshore wind and other things like that having some legislative support around achieving those targets and embracing those technologies I think would be helpful to any investor in the state as well as to the commission.  So you can think about that IRP as providing a menu of options and we can get going even absent changes on the transition up to -- I think that base plan is a 50% to 55% carbon reduction under existing statutes. Steve Fleishman : Great. Okay. Thank you very much. That's helpful. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Anthony Crowdell : Thanks. Good morning, Lynn. Good morning, Steve. Lynn Good : Good morning. Steve Young : Good morning. Anthony Crowdell : Thank you so much for the information slide. I just have two quick. One related to Slide 12 and the other growing CapEx profile. I guess first, how much of that CapEx is maybe rider eligible? I mean the company is kind of winding down hopefully the resolution in North Carolina winding down a rate case cycle. How much could that get included in rates without a rate filing? And are you entering another rate case cycle?  And then the follow-up would be it appears that the Duke service territory has a significant amount of investment opportunities especially compared to maybe other companies. What's the limitation there? Is it balance sheet? Is it rate impact? And I'll leave it at that. Lynn Good : So in the Carolinas, Anthony, the regulatory structure is still a rate base -- rate case-type structure. I think as we think about this regulatory reform multi-year rate planning, decoupling, performance-based rate making are in the conversation and our hope and expectation is there will be some adjustment to that regulatory process. We have not laid out any specific timing for rate cases. We have just finished a rate case here in 2020. So you would not expect us to come in the short-term. Steve Young : Right. And I'd agree with that. In the Carolinas, we're working to put it into place some mechanisms that help incent as Lynn said this growing investment profile that we have going forward. Our gas businesses in the Midwest and Florida we have mechanisms in place and they work very well for us whether it's rider mechanisms or multiyear rate planning or decoupling on the gas side. So, we're very familiar with those. We're advancing the ball in the Carolinas with this dialogue. And I think we'll make some progress as we move forward. Lynn Good : And on the second part of the question around constraints Anthony we always plan capital within what I would call a reasonable expectation of impact to customer price. So, as we talked about in the integrated resource plan discussion the base plan is about a 1% increase in customer rates per year. As you get more aggressive it could go up to 2.5%. That includes offsets for fuel and O&M and so on that would be a part of the transition. So, we always keep an eye on price. And in addition to those tools of fuel and O&M that will come naturally from transitioning to generation we also continue to very aggressively drive costs out of the business through digitization through changes in process all forms of automation. And that will continue to be an objective to keep prices low for customers. Anthony Crowdell : Great. Thanks for taking my questions and I'm looking forward to connecting at EEI with the team. Lynn Good : Thank you. Appreciate that. Steve Young : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Go ahead. Lynn Good : Good morning. Jeremy Tonet : Hi good morning. Steve Young : Good morning. Jeremy Tonet : I think you've touched on 2021 O&M a bit here but just thinking about that a bit more. Is the timing of 2020 planned outages kind of the main driver of higher 2021 O&M? But are there other factors to think about here? And how should we think about 2021 O&M versus 2019 as a base year? And kind of what does the trajectory look like longer-term as the pandemic subsides? Steve Young : Sure. Lynn had mentioned and I had mentioned outages as being one thing that potentially could put some upward pressure on O&M going forward. We'll also look at variable compensation. That's another area that we have a flex on that could see an increase in 2021. So, we'll continue to look at that. I'd say those are a couple of areas there. When you think about our O&M trajectory as a whole we started back in 2015 at $5 billion of non-recoverable O&M if you will. And in 2019 that was at $4.9 billion and that included absorbing $280 million to $300 million at Piedmont because they were acquired during that period of time. That gives you an idea of the savings that we've been able to generate through this very concerted effort of business transformation. We're going to come in lower in 2020 because of all of the tactical efforts that we've put in place to replace the top line revenue loss. That will move up in 2021 but I suspect the downward trajectory is going to continue in 2021 over 2019. We'll be firming that up as we go forward. But our sustainable reductions will continue. I do believe that. Lynn Good : And what we're trying to do Jeremy as we've said a couple of times is this load continues to represent a headwind in 2021. We do not see it quite back to 2019 based on our projections although we would be delighted to be surprised to the upside. We'll keep costs under control consistent with that weakness in the top line as we think about 2021. Jeremy Tonet : Great, that's very helpful. I'll stop there. Thanks. Lynn Good : Thank you, Jeremy. Operator : Our next question will come from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research Partners. Go ahead. Jonathan Arnold : Good morning. Lynn Good : Good morning. Jonathan Arnold : I think my questions was covered. But could I just -- could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the renewables development space for the commercial business? And just remind us where that sort of fits into how you're talking about the growth outlook? Lynn Good : Jonathan we continue to see a lot of project opportunity and a pipeline of contracts and projects under development. We have targeted $200 million to $250 million of net income over the five-year period. And we have a clear line of sight to achieving that during the five years. So, we feel very good about the business. When you couple that expertise with the renewables that we're building in the regulated business I feel like the team is doing a good job of understanding the integration of the resources how to develop and build them cost effectively. And so that's what you can expect kind of a $200 million to $250 million contribution from commercial renewables going forward. Jonathan Arnold : Great. And then just if I may then on your comments about seeing upside potential to the $5.15. I'm just curious if you could I know this has been covered. But is that incremental comfort that you've developed since you first put that number out there or really just articulating kind of a path that you were already on a lot more clearly? Lynn Good : Probably a little bit more comfort Jonathan in that. We've got three more months behind us on COVID. Our forecast for that had been pretty accurate in terms of net income. But we'll be watching it over November and December with the second wave. And the rate cases have always been out there as something that represents an opportunity and then we talked about cost management. We're going through everything we've done in 2020 to challenge whether it's achievable in 2021 and that work is part of our normal process that Steve leads in connection with the five-year plan. So, probably a little more confidence because we've got three more months of experience. Steve how would you add? Steve Young : Yes, I'd agree with that. We are starting to firm up what we can -- what we've learned from COVID on cost reductions and we'll continue to drive that out and that's always helpful to our plan. So, we'll be continuing to push on this and drive more detail as we go forward. Jonathan Arnold : Great. Thanks for the update. Lynn Good : All right Jonathan. Thank you. Operator : And that will conclude our Q&A session for today's call. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Lynn Good for closing remarks. Lynn Good : Thank you, Savanna and thanks to everyone who joined. We're looking forward to talking with many of you if not all of you next week in our Virtual EEI Meeting. So, thanks again for joining and thanks for your investment in Duke Energy. Operator : And this will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jack Sullivan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Jack Sullivan : Thank you, Hannah. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Duke Energy's fourth quarter 2020 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, our Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information within the meaning of the securities laws. Actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking statements, and those factors are outlined herein and disclosed in Duke Energy's SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found in today's materials and on duke-energy.com. Please note the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. So, with that, let\u2019s turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Jack thank you. And good morning, everyone. I want to take a moment and welcome Jack to his first earnings call. He has recently assumed responsibility as Vice President of Investor Relations after a very strong 15-year career with Duke where he's had financial experience, capital markets experience, M&A experience, and bring that wealth of background to this role as well as a deep understanding of our company and our industry. We have put him to work over the last couple of weeks with all of our announcements. So many of you have already had a chance to meet and talk with Jack, but you can look forward to more interaction with him as we go forward. So good morning to all of you. It's great to be with you for our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. We began the year with significant momentum on strategic, regulatory and stakeholder fronts. And I'm very optimistic about our future heading into 2021. Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $5.12 for the year, putting us solidly within our updated guidance range for 2020. These results reflect the strength of our regulatory utilities, our commitment to generating sustainable shareholder value and our financial agility, especially in response to the unique difficulties of this past year. We also affirmed our 2021 guidance range of $5 to $5.30, with a midpoint of $5.15, and our recently increased long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2025 based off the midpoint of our 2021 guidance range. Like most companies, 2020 presented us with new challenges and I'm extremely proud of how we responded. We faced those challenges head-on, swiftly responding to the COVID-19 pandemic to support our customers and our workforce, adjusting our plans after removing Atlantic Coast Pipeline, producing $450 million of mitigation actions and responding to significant storms throughout the year. All of this was made possible by our employees who showed incredible results, as they adjusted to new working conditions, identified cost savings, and operational improvements and maintained reliable service for our customers. In short, we did more than just get through 2020 we adapted and delivered learning new ways of working that will benefit us in the years ahead. The momentum from 2020 has continued into 2021. And turning to Slide 5, Duke Energy has made significant progress resolving uncertainties around our company and laying a solid foundation for growth into the future. Slide 5 captures myriad accomplishments with the Duke Energy team delivered all providing benefits to our customers and our investors, and allowing us to turn our full attention to advancing our goal to reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2030, and achieve net-zero by 2050. In North Carolina, we reached a milestone settlement with the State Attorney General, Public Staff and Sierra Club to close the debate around coal ash cost recovery. We're pleased with this balanced compromise, resolved several outstanding issues including the remand of the 2017 and 2019 rate cases and the pending 2019 rate cases. It also provides greater clarity and recovery of coal ash costs incurred through early 2013 and preserves our ability to earn an equity return on deferred coal ash costs. This settlement complements the previous settlement reached in the summer of 2020 on ROE and capital structure, and again demonstrates our commitment to working collaboratively with stakeholders in our jurisdiction. We look forward to the Commission's order, addressing these settlements and the remaining issues in the case. We also developed innovative IRPs in the Carolinas outlining comprehensive proposals and offering six portfolios to meet key carbon reduction milestones over the next 15 years. And for the past year, we've been working with stakeholder groups to help shape North Carolina's clean energy plan, with a common goal of reaching net-zero carbon in a way that best serves our customers. This complements the efforts underway on regulatory reform and introducing more efficient cost recovery mechanisms. Shifting to Florida, we worked with business and consumer groups, including the Office of Public Counsel, to propose a new three-year settlement giving our investors and customers clear visibility for 2024. The settlement includes multi-year-based rate increases to recover significant investments in the grid, solar generation and electric vehicle infrastructure. It also allows for the accelerated depreciation of coal plants and supports innovative technology pilot programs that are important to achieving our carbon goals and clean energy future. We expect an order from the Florida Commission by the end of the second quarter with rates effective in January of 2022. Beyond the multi-year rate plan, we also received approval of the first three years of our storm protection plans, representing a $6 billion investment in grid hardening projects over the next 10 years. In Indiana, we recently announced the GIC, a global investment firm with significant experience investing in U.S. infrastructure companies will become a minority investor in Duke Energy, Indiana. For $2.05 billion GIC will acquire a 19.9% ownership stake with governance rights commensurate with their equity ownership. GIC highlighted through a proven track record of high performance and clear commitment to a clean energy transition make this an attractive partnership for them. The transaction values our DEI utility and an attractive multiple to our current stock valuation, providing an efficient source of financing for our business and allowing us to eliminate all common equity from our five-year plan. The structure of the investment also allows us to better match financing with capital needs, putting $1 billion into our company in 2021 and the second tranche no later than January of 2023. This investment is a strong endorsement of our company and the Duke Energy, Indiana, our operations, employees and opportunities for growth. It is also a strong endorsement of our overall strategy to be a leader in clean energy transformation. We also significantly expanded our renewable footprints in our regulated and commercial businesses announcing more than 700 megawatts of solar and wind energy projects. And we built momentum around the electric vehicle pilot programs, which was further amplified by our own [indiscernible] to electrify the Duke Energy fleet. And turning to Tennessee, we reached a constructive settlement in our Piedmont Natural Gas rate case with the Attorney General's Consumer Advocate Division. This is our first general rate case in Tennessee in almost nine years allowing us to recover needed infrastructure investments to serve our growing customer base in and around [indiscernible]. This is an impressive list of accomplishments and we will keep going with a clear, clean energy vision and growth in the 5% to 7% range underpinned by our robust capital plan, constructive jurisdictions, operational excellence and a diverse, committed workforce. Shifting to Slide 6, we began 2021 with a clear vision for the future to lead the clean energy transition in our communities. Our goal is captured clearly in our climate strategy, at least 50% carbon reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2050. We crossed a major milestone in 2020, surpassing 40% carbon reduction from 2005 levels, and we're poised to hit more milestones in the years to come. A roadmap to success involves close collaboration with key stakeholders and accelerated move from coal and into cleaner forms of generation, including renewables and battery storage; the modernization of our grid to enable more clean energy and an unwavering commitment to reliability and affordability. 2021 is an important year on this journey. In North Carolina stakeholder discussions initiated by the governor's clean energy plan are beginning to wrap up. These conversations have been very helpful in creating a common understanding among the interested parties on clean energy principles, and the regulatory changes needed to effectuate a generation transition. As the 2021 legislative session begins, we believe both stakeholders and policymakers will benefit from this work, as well as the information found in the comprehensive IRPs we filed last summer. Those resource plans present several pathways that illustrate the trade-offs between the pace of transition and cost implications. We look forward to working with legislators and stakeholders over the next several weeks and months to evaluate the various options. And we are optimistic about the policies that can be created from shared objectives around North Carolina's clean energy transition, as well as the regulatory reforms that provide for timely recovery of these investments. In Indiana, we will continue our critical grid improvement projects and further our clean energy transition as we file our 2021 IRP this November. In Florida, our recent settlement outlines the clear path for further renewable and EV investment in the states through 2024 and the accelerated retirement of coal plants. And at the federal level, we will work closely with policy makers, as the Biden administration re-enters the Paris Agreement and sets a national policy that advances our country's transition to clean energy. We look forward to adding our voice to this important discussion ensuring that the policies strategically integrate emissions reductions, cost considerations, and the promotion of a broad range of technology development. Our objectives are clear and will create value for all of our stakeholders. Our climate strategy is our growth strategy and our relentless commitment to our bold climate targets means we are leading the transition to clean energy. Our aggressive $59 billion capital plan is among the largest in the industry placing us at the forefront of clean energy at scale. We're confident this capital will generate value for our growing construction jurisdictions and provide clean, affordable energy for the more than 25 million customers we serve every day. This capital plan positions Duke to achieve earnings growth of 5% to 7% based off the 2021 midpoint of 515. I'm very proud of our results and excited about Duke Energy\u2019s path forward. And with that, let me turn the call over to Steve. Steve Young : Thanks, Lynn. And good morning everyone. 2020 was a year marked by agility and transformation. We delivered results within our guidance range, overcame headwinds and leveraged our size and scale to position the company for significant growth in the years ahead. As shown on Slide 7, our full year reported and adjusted earnings per share were $1.72 and $5.12, as compared to $5.06 of reported and adjusted earnings per share in 2019. We took swift and decisive action to mitigate the challenges we faced this year. We did not allow COVID-19, mild weather, storm and the loss of ACP earnings to define our path forward. And this commitment and dexterity enabled us to deliver solidly within our narrow 2020 earnings guidance range. Our 2020 results were driven by strong execution across each of our operating segments. Growth from our rate case execution in Indiana and Kentucky, interim rates in North Carolina and continued growth from our Florida operations through their multi-year rate plan and SoBRA mechanisms produce positive results in electric utilities and infrastructure. We also saw growth in our Carolinas wholesale business due to the new Formula Rate contract that was effective this year. These factors were offset by regulatory lag on our growing assets base, milder weather and dilution from equity issuances. Shifting to gas utilities and infrastructure, we saw higher results in our LDC businesses, primarily due to Piedmont's rate case in North Carolina and contributions from rider mechanisms. The gas LDCs continue to provide strong earnings growth, adding $0.11 driven by customer additions and investments and integrity management, but offset by the cancellation of ACP in July. Results in Commercial Renewables were higher than 2019 driven by new projects placed in service, including Palmer, Holstein, and Rambler, which together totaled 460 megawatts. Going forward, we continue to plan for this segment to deliver between $200 million and $250 million of net income per year over the five-year plan with a potential for upside that projects meet our return expectations. Having accomplished a lot in 2020, we turned to 2021, well positioned to achieve our adjusted EPS guidance range at $5 to $5.30 with $5.15 midpoint. Turning to Slide 8. Our financial outlook for 2021 and beyond is strong and rooted in our increased capital investment plan. Our core utilities continue to generate solid growth, driving our earnings results upward for the foreseeable future. For electric utilities and infrastructure growth in 2021 will come from our customer additions and infrastructure investments across our franchises. In the Carolinas, we will experience growth and revised rates in our current pending rate cases. In Florida, we expect strong earnings contributions as we move into the final year of our multi-year rate plan, coupled with growth in the solar via the SoBRA mechanism. In 2021, we will continue to benefit from a steady growth of our T&D infrastructure investments in the Midwest, along with new effective rates in Indiana and Kentucky. As the economy continues to rebound from the pandemic, we forecast our 2021 load growth in the 1% to 2% range across our entire footprint, driven by some of the strongest customer growth we've seen in recent years. Our Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment provides consistent and steady growth, largely driven by our organic customer additions and integrity management investments. These investments will translate to revenues through riders and base rate adjustment mechanisms and our LDCs such as the recent rate settlement filed in Tennessee. In commercial renewables in 2021, we will deliver our annual earnings solidly in the $200 million to $250 million range and throughout the five-year plan. We expect the other segment to be lower year-over-year. This is primarily due to favorable tax optimization in 2020, not producing the same level of contributions in 2021 and the expectation of lower market returns in our captive insurance program and [indiscernible]. Finally, we have adjusted our plans to reflect the cancellation of ACP and the full year impact of the $2.5 billion equity forward transaction that closed in December of 2020. Including this, we expect growth in our core businesses of 6% in 2021. Turning to Slide 9. Let me touch on electric volumes and economic trends. We operate in constructive and growing jurisdictions. That said like most utilities, we saw a decline in retail load for 2020, given the impact of the pandemic. While residential volumes were up 3% for the year that did not offset the lower volumes from commercial and industrial customers. As we look at customer growth, we've experienced very positive trends, closing out 2020 with 1.8% growth for the year. This was favorable to the projections we originally shared in May of last year and the firms we operate in high growth states. In fact, our franchises serve four of the top eight states in terms of positive population migration. We projected an overall increase in electricity consumption in 2021 of 1% to 2% over 2020, given many of our commercial and industrial customers continue to return to normal operations. We expect the metrics for residential may decline a bit as people began to return to the workplace, following the mass distribution of the COVID vaccine. For the five-year plan, we projected load growth of 0.5% to 1% as the economy returns to pre-COVID status. On Slide 10, you will see the transformative work underway to lower our cost structure and bolster our growth potential. Duke Energy is a leader in the industry when it comes to cost mitigation driven by digital capabilities, data analytics, and retraining, and re-skilling employees which serves, which drives a more versatile workforce. Taking together, these factors result a meaningful and sustainable savings. When 2020 began with weaker weather and storms, we initiated tactical business drivers to significantly reduce our O&M costs. Then in response to the pandemic in the first quarter, we accelerated these mitigations to offset projected impacts. By the end of the year, we delivered $450 million of mitigation. This included $320 million of O&M savings equivalent to more than 6% of our 2020 non rider recoverable O&M. And this was done with a keen focus on minimizing the impacts to employee jobs. A certain cost savings in 2020 were one-time opportunities, we have identified many others that are sustainable, which will ultimately benefit our customers and shareholders over the long-term. These sustainable savings of approximately $200 million are underpinned by our versatile workforce who continue to adopt advanced technologies to perform work with increased efficiencies, allowing us to take advantage of attrition, reduce employee expenses and minimize facilities cost. In the past five years on that regulated electric and gas O&M has declined approximately 1% per year, even with the acquisition of Piedmont natural gas and we expect this downward trend to continue. Moving to Slide 11, as Lynn discussed, we have a robust capital plan of $59 billion over the five-year planning period. About 70% of this capital investment will be geared towards investments in clean energy and the grid infrastructure that supports it. We expect the clean energy transformation to ramp up over the five-year period and grow even further to $65 billion to $75 billion when we enter the back half of the decade. This will be largely driven by more coal plant retirements and the acceleration of renewables. We expect to gain more clarity around this projection as our states make important carbon policy decisions. These investments across our electric and LDC franchises position us for a five-year rate-based CAGR of approximately 6.5%. For the next five-year period ending in 2029, we see that growth accelerating to 7% based on our growing capital needs during this transition and transformation. Turning to Slide 12, our growing capital plan, vibrant franchise service area growth and proven capability to control costs and work constructively with stakeholders to move through regulatory processes, give us confidence in our ability to consistently grow our adjusted earnings per share of 5% to 7% throughout the five-year period. Bear in mind this capital plan assumes the lowering carbon reduction scenarios in the Carolinas. Moving to Slide 13. Our ability to execute on a robust capital program is underpinned by healthy balance sheet and solid credit ratings. We announced a $2.05 billion minority investment in our Indiana utility, where we will remain majority owner and sole operator with private equity investment by reputable infrastructure, investor demonstrates the premium valuation of our regulated utilities addresses all equity needs for the next five years and supports a strong balance sheet that allows access to low-cost capital. The equity from the Indiana transaction along with our overall financing plan allows us to maintain a healthy credit profile, targeting a consolidated FFO to debt ratio of 14%. Before we open it up for questions, let me close with Slide 14. We are positioned to deliver results for our shareholders and are confident in the 2021 base year EPS guidance and robust capital plan we have laid out for you. Our focus on the future, sound investment strategy and demonstrated dexterity position us to consistently deliver within our increased 5% to 7% long-term EPS growth rate through 2025. Our commitment to the dividend remains unchanged. We understand how important it is to our shareholders and that's why 2021 will mark the 95th consecutive year of paying a quarterly cash dividend. We intend to keep growing the Duke Energy dividend, balancing our desire to offer investors a strong payout with our need to fund our capital plan. As Lynn said in her opening remarks 2020, the early part of 2021 have been transformed for Duke Energy. And we lean into the next decade with anticipation and resolve to achieve our goals for our customers and our shareholders. With that, we'll open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shar Pourreza : Hey, Good morning, guys. Lynn Good : Good morning, Shar. Shar Pourreza : So, a couple of quick questions here. Lynn, obviously you highlight some factors that would provide upside to the base plan like your acceleration of clean energy, federal legislation. So, to the extent that these items require incremental CapEx, would you kind of consider monetizing additional stakes at your OpCos like Indiana similar to the GIC deal versus maybe tapping traditional financing like equity? Obviously, the demand is there for these strategies and the transaction multiple was certainly healthy versus where your stock trades? Lynn Good : Yes. So Shar thank you for that question. And as we looked at the $60 billion, $59 billion, $60 billion of capital in front of us, we saw this transaction as an attractive investment that gave us an opportunity to eliminate common stock. As you said, is a valuation that was attractive to our investors and frankly recognize the value of what we operate in Indiana. I would say if we look at this five-year period, we feel like we've got a pretty strong capital plan. There may be some upside in the back part of the plan Shar, but I'd look at the clean energy transition that's underway. We have some work to do in 2021 and 2022 to lay further groundwork. And so that escalation will be toward the end of the five-year continuing over the rest of the decade. We will always look for attractive ways to finance growth. And I think we've demonstrated that with this transaction, but don't have anything in the near term that I would point to just reinforce that finding attractive low-cost capital to underpin growth is always an objective. And we're really pleased with what we were able to accomplish with this transaction. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then obviously you highlight the higher growth rate and the movement you're seeing in North Carolina, and obviously there has been recommendations provided by working groups in the state. I'm wondering how sort of the North Carolina clean energy legislation could impact sort of this updated growth trajectory as it should investors sort of look at it as simply as an extend the runway scenario, or could actually be accretive to that growth through maybe accelerated spending opportunities, less regulatory lag. I mean, obviously we're assuming that you get some ROE [bans] [ph], PBRs gets approved, but so how do we sort of think about the legislation in light of the updated growth? Lynn Good : Sure. I mean Shar, the first thing I'd like to do is express the confidence we have in achieving 5% to 7%. It has been grounded in not only strong franchise growth, the regulatory certainty we've been able to achieve, including a recent settlement with the AG. The investment opportunities we've talked about on decarbonizing, and then our ability to control costs coupled with the transaction with GIC eliminating equity gives us a really solid foundation for 5% to 7%. So, I look at what we've put in front of you is a capital plan and a strategy with a high degree of confidence to achieve 5% to 7%. I think the ability to reach that top end to keep going would include faster acceleration of generation transition, perhaps faster economic recovery. I put in that list also, Shar, we're seeing such incredible customer growth in the areas that we serve because the population migration that could be another item that would be a surprise to the upside in a good way, sustainable cost savings. If we continue the digital transformation, continue grid modernization, continue retirement of the coal fleet, all of those things will give us an opportunity to continue to drive [indiscernible]. And I do think regulatory lag, if we can find a way to lessen it the growth is going to be strengthened. And so, I come to this discussion with a lot of confidence that we have a plan that will achieve the 5% to 7% and we'll continue to work on the legislation and regulatory reform in a way that'll complement the growth and perhaps enhance it if it moves more quickly. Shar Pourreza : Terrific. And just lastly for me, I know in your discussions with stakeholders, are you finding sort of an alignment with the Governor and key legislators here, and what's kind of the next data point we should be watching out for? Lynn Good : We have been at work on this Shar. We talked about for some time and have been engaged actively with stakeholders, really building alignment around a common goal, common objectives and those objectives included moving away from coal, carbon reduction, regulatory mechanisms to incent that move. And then of course increased investment in renewable, all within the construct of maintaining reliability and affordability. So, I think, the common objectives really provide a really strong foundation to move forward. So, we're working to advance those objectives and we will continue to provide updates along the way. The session that is underway right now there will be some milestones in April around potential introduction of bills, but what I would point to is with common objectives with a desire to create momentum on carbon reduction I think that alignment provides a great foundation for moving forward. Shar Pourreza : Terrific. Thank you very much. Congrats. And I'll jump back in the queue. Lynn Good : Thank you, Shar. Steve Young : Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd : Hi, good morning. Hope you all are doing well. Lynn Good : Hi, Stephen. Yes, hope you\u2019re well? Stephen Byrd : Thanks, I am. I wanted to talk about the prospects for further federal legislation supporting clean energy. I guess we're growing more optimistic that we may see kind of round two of legislative support this summer into the fall where Congress might further extend the duration of tax credits for wind and solar and potentially add a new tax credit for energy storage. And as you think about that, those kinds of elements of support, how do you think about that in terms of your longer-term resource planning? Could that have an impact in terms just kind of thinking through the economic cost of renewable energy? Lynn Good : I think it will. And I think all of that to the benefit of our customers and our regulated jurisdictions. And so, as you look at, even the integrated resource plans that we shared in the fall, those were predicated on the tax policy that existed at that time. And so, extensions could be valuable, I think credits around battery storage, electric vehicles, all of those represent opportunities to continue the clean energy transition. So, I would say we'll watch it closely. Stephen Byrd : Okay. Very good. And then maybe just thinking about offshore wind, if the decision was made at the state level to start to sort of at least explore or pursue offshore wind, how do you sort of think about next steps? I'm just not familiar enough with sort of the technical feasibility of offshore wind, what kind of early steps you might take if the decision was made that the state wants to go in that direction? Lynn Good : Stephen, we've been working on the potential for offshore wind for some time. Not only in terms of the obvious issues around leases and location of leases, but also transmission infrastructure that would need to accompany that where in the Carolinas, in particular, the load centers are further west than the coast. So, finding an appropriate transmission path would be important. I think there's been more conversation in the Carolinas. The Governor has joined with other Mid-Atlantic Governors, signing an MOU to say, let's spend more time figuring this out. There's a study underway to look at the impact to economic development. And so, I would say we're monitoring all of this closely. I would think about it is maybe a late 2020, 2030 opportunity in the Carolinas. But nonetheless, we are supportive of finding ways to bring wind into the state as a complement to the solar and nuclear resources that we have that are carbon free. So, I think more to come on that Stephen as some of these exploratory processes bear fruit. Stephen Byrd : It's well taken. It's a long lead time to kind of think through these issues for offshore wind. Maybe last question, just on the commercial renewables business, I was just curious your latest thinking in terms of the competitive dynamics in renewables. Are you seeing any sort of trends in terms of increased competition? What we're just anecdotally hearing some degree of increased competition, but I'm just kind of curious what you all are seeing on that side of the business? Lynn Good : Stephen, we see it as a competitive. It's been competitive for some time. It started to delineate. Is it a little bit more competitive? So, from our standpoint, we stay very disciplined on the cost of capital, the returns that we want and have a combination of development around the U.S., but also really focused on how we can grow renewables within our own jurisdictions. But I think it's a fair comment. There's a lot of interest in investment moving into renewable energy and that by its nature will create competition. Stephen Byrd : Very good. That's all I have. Thank you very much. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman : Hi, good morning. Lynn Good : Good morning, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Hi Lynn. Hey Steve. So just wanted to go back to a prior question, which I'm not sure was answered on the North Carolina Governor's kind of discussions and the like, and just next steps. Is there still going to be kind of a report that comes out from that? And then when would we likely see legislation proposed? Lynn Good : Sure. And Steve on the specific question of the report, there were two processes. So, the regulatory reform report is out. This is the one that talks about multi-year rate plans, performance incentives really a strong endorsement of regulatory reform is important to incenting movement. So that one is out and discussions of course continue on that. The carbon policy report, which is the one that's been led by the Nicholas Institute, shouldn't be coming any time. And I would think about it, Steve, as a data point, there'll be considered in the legislative session, along with our IRPs frankly, that has garnered a lot of stakeholder discussion. We don't expect that carbon policy report to include specific recommendations. But we believe it will be a discussion of retirement of coal, carbon pricing, clean energy standards, et cetera. And these \u2013 the stakeholders that have been involved in all of these processes, integrated resource plan, clean energy, policy discussions that the Governor sponsored the regulatory reform. All of those stakeholders have been working together quite well over the course of the year. And when I talked about common objectives, but I was really speaking to it's a common objective that have come out of all of that, common objectives around retirement of coal, common objectives around increasing renewable, regulatory reform, et cetera. So, it's that bringing together of those common objectives has been worked on to try to advance where we go from here. And I'm optimistic that we have a number of very informed and stakeholder groups that have common views of positioning North Carolina for the future. And I think progress will come from that. There's also a keen focus in that group on reliability and affordability, which we also strongly endorse and come to the conversation with very low prices against national averages, and we'll be working actively to make sure we make progress within that construct as well. Steve Fleishman : Okay. That's good. And then just on the book \u2013 ignoring an event that no law passes and if we're just kind of doing regulation in the Carolinas as we have it now. Could you just give a sense of just how you would manage this kind of and maybe increasing spend on the regulatory side? Is it just the annual rate cases or\u2026 Lynn Good : Yes, Steve, I think it's important to maybe step back for a moment. When we put forward the integrated resource plan and the Carolina in February 6 in the areas, the base scenario, the one that's on the far left is one that can be accomplished without any changes in regulation or legislation, et cetera. And the capital plan that we've put in front of you, it's really predicated on that base plan. So we believe the grid investment, the investment in generation that's included in our plan for the Carolinas can be executed. You could think about the overlay of legislation and perhaps new tools and maybe acceleration being incremental to what we've put in front of you. We thought it was prudent to put together a plan that we have a high degree of confidence to achieve under a variety of scenarios. But we'll work actively as we have over the last year and a half with stakeholders to find a way to meet those objectives. Steve Fleishman : Great. One last quick one, just the \u2013 I think I heard Steve say the 5% \u2013 when you look at the 5% to 7% growth rate, it's kind of consistent over the period, roughly. Is that fair? Steve Young : That\u2019s right. Lynn Good : That's correct. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Thank you. Lynn Good : Thanks, Steve. Operator : And we'll go next to Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good morning, congratulations. Lynn Good : Good morning. Steve Young : Good morning. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Perhaps just to follow up on this, because I want to understand. So can you talk about legislation and having worked for years to try to get the staples of the curve, but at the same time, we talked about this IRP pending before the commission. Can you talk about how those two processes work as best you understand right now, let's say for instance, you don't get legislation? How does the IRP proceed in that case? And perhaps the overlap in timing critically, have you think about April versus the IRP [indiscernible]. Lynn Good : Sure. I mean that Julien I was thinking of these things as being complementary. The stakeholder group has been involved in the IRPs. The stakeholder group has been involved in the clean energy policy discussions or there's a high degree of overlap. And so let's talk a little bit about the IRP because we haven't visited about that in this call. North Carolina will review the IRP comments are due at the end of April. And we would expect an order from the North Carolina Commission yet this year, probably in the fall. And the North Carolina Commission doesn't approve, but rather provide comments perspectives on what they've seen. And so, it becomes a data point, right, not only for the legislative process, but also for the Commission on how we're thinking about the future. And stakeholder parties will have an opportunity to weigh in and discuss. In South Carolina, the IRP will be approved or reviewed and an order will be issued by the Commission. This is consistent with AXE60Q [ph], which you may remember, being a requirement in South Carolina, we believe our IRP conforms with those requirements, extensive stakeholder engagement and analysis of coal retirements and analysis of rate impact. So, we should expect to hear from the South Carolina Commission in June. The legislative session, the bills would be introduced in this legislative session in April. Crossover dates are in May. So, the legislative session is also running July and in the first half of the year. And so I would think about all these things as complimentary. The same people at the table talking about the same objectives, lowering carbon, building renewables, grid investments, regulatory reform. And we will keep you informed along the way as milestones are achieved and feedback is received. But I'm optimistic about informed for those stakeholders coming together with shared objectives. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. Thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: I\u2019m interested to follow-up on the consistency of the 5% to 7% if I can quickly. Lynn Good : Sure. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Can you comment on the earned ROE trend across the years I'm thinking Carolina has obviously you guys have a range established this year? Is that range broadly the same range through the forecasted period, or how would you characterize that? Steve Young : Yes, I think, broadly, it's just going to be similar. We have a settlement proposal at a 9.6% ROE, but we've got a long track record in the Carolina, and across our entire footprint of being able to earn at or, in some years certainly above our allowed returns through cost management, through working on wholesale type transactions, as well. So, I think there are a number of mechanisms that are going to allow us to earn similar to what we\u2019ve earned in the past on our regulated jurisdictions. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay, excellent. Thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Michael Weinstein with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Michael Weinstein : Hi, guys. Lynn Good : Good morning. Steve Young : Hey good morning. Michael Weinstein : Hey. On the same topic, could you comment a little bit about the ROE projection you guys have in there for 2021 for Indiana, and Ohio and Kentucky as well? Both looking pretty well trending towards lower numbers going forward, sub-9%, sub-8%, Kentucky? Steve Young : Yes, I have a couple of comments there. In Indiana, we just filed \u2013 we got a rate order in August in Indiana. And that was a catch-up rate case. So, what you see when you've got a big base rate case that's built up and in Indiana, we had that base rate case in quite a while. So, you are building up a lot of investments there. And prior to that build-up, you're going to see the ROEs drop a bit. And then you have to catch up. And we've got the solid ROE in Indiana going forward. We'll be able to optimize around that and earn very well there. Ohio is a similar situation, when you have a base rate case, you\u2019ll build up investments up to that point, and then the new rates will work on the return. So, you'll see some movements around a rate case like that. But over a broad period, as you've seen the New York across our footprint, we've been very capable of earning ROI returns on the growing rate base. And we've done that through periods where we've had more frequent rate cases and periods where we've had less frequent rate cases. And that's where you utilize your capital optimization between rate cases and cost control to keep the return solid. So, we\u2019ll continue to have those capabilities. Michael Weinstein : Are you planning on having a base rate case in Indiana? I didn\u2019t see that in the deck. Steve Young : No. Lynn Good : Not in the near-term Michael. Steve Young : No, not in the near term. We cut out those investments, most of our growth will be coming just from the environmental rider. So, it's a very efficient jurisdiction going forward here. Michael Weinstein : So, you think it will improve after 2021, basically, the ROEs? Steve Young : Yes. Michael Weinstein : And how is the 5% to 7% growth CAGR weighted? Is that a steady growth rate at the periods of 2025 or is that backend? Lynn Good : I would think about it as a steady growth rate. Steve Young : Yes. Michael Weinstein : Okay. And dividend growth, I know that we're still in that slower than ETS growth period. Is that expected to continue given the highest CapEx per month you have? Lynn Good : I think certainly in the near term, Michael, and then we'll evaluate it as we get deeper into the five-year plan, the growth shows up, the payout ratio comes down a bit. So, we understand the importance of the growing dividend. And we'll continue to look at that right balance between growth of capital and growth of the dividend. Michael Weinstein : Great. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you very much. Lynn Good : All right. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Jonathan Arnold with Vertical. Jonathan Arnold : Good morning, guys. Lynn Good : Hi, Jonathan. Jonathan Arnold : Hi, just to revisit this question of what's in the plan. And you said pretty clearly that the low end, the left-hand end of the Carolina\u2019s transition, the IRP proposals is what's in your plan in your CapEx? Does that apply to \u2013 how would you sort of tie that to the second half of the decade where you've got this $65 billion to $75 billion five-year spend for $25.329? Just curious if that\u2019s still the case, or is that you're starting to dip into acceleration there? Steve Young : Well, what we reflected in that second half of the decade, the range of $65 billion to $75 billion, represented, again, the low-end scenarios of carbon reduction versus the higher, more aggressive carbon reduction. So, as we learn more about the pacing that the state wants to go through, we projected we'd be somewhere in that range depending on that pacing up to $65 billion to $75 billion as you move into it that second five-year period. Lynn Good : And Jonathan, even the base plan of IRP includes over 50% carbon reduction, and includes quite a bit of transition of generation, retirement of coal and renewables. And so, as Steve indicated, we'll learn more around pace in particular, as we go through, the next few months and hear from commissions, et cetera. And the $75 billion would be the more aggressive, kind of to the 70% type range, but even the base plan has a very healthy growth rate within that range. Jonathan Arnold : Okay, great. Thank you for clarifying there. And then, obviously, 25%, you already have a number out for so that $65 billion to $75 billion implies the quite a material step-up to really in the back \u2013 very closer to the back end of the decade. Is that right way to think about it, or is it a 25 number that could be in play if things decided to move faster, I guess? Lynn Good : I think 25% could be in play, Jonathan. I think about it in this way, takes a little bit of time to develop site permit generation. But as we think about this 2021 by the time 2025 rolls around, we will have a clearer picture on that. And coal retirements go along with us. And so, we'll be into a deeper amount of coal being retired in that part of the decade and so you'll be building generation to replace them that way. We'll know more and of course, update these expectations all along the way. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. Thank you. And just may be one other thing. It looked like there was a fair step up in what you're categorizing, as maintenance CapEx in the five-year plan a couple of billion versus last year. Is that a categorization issue, or is it different spend, or what's going on there? Steve Young : Nothing procedural there, I just think we're looking at the maintenance of the nuclear facilities and the grid facilities as we modernize the grid. There is more CapEx of maintenance nature in those areas, in those two specific areas. Lynn Good : And Jonathan, we did do a little bit of changing our profile around maintenance, outages and other things in 2020, because of COVID. And so, I believe some of that will also be movement of outage and investment that goes with it into 2021 consistent with the challenges of the year. Jonathan Arnold : Got you. Okay, thanks a lot. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Lynn Good : Good morning. Durgesh Chopra : Hey good morning for thank my questions. Steve Young : Good morning. Durgesh Chopra : Hopefully two quick questions. One, Steve, just can you remind us the tax optimization in 2020, you mentioned this in your drivers when you won over 2020. What is that tax optimization? Any color on the upfront? Steve Young : What we have done in 2020, we had worked on various efforts that lowered the effective tax rate a bit. And that falls through and was part of the mitigation that was put in place. And it was probably around 0.5% on the effective tax rate reduction might have been in the range of $0.0.4, $0.05 or so of mitigation that we got out of income taxes. Lynn Good : And Durgesh I would share with you that the tax team is always looking for ways to optimize taxes, whether it's a state level property taxes, federal tax, tax credits, research and development, et cetera. And so, we were quite effective in 2020, with a variety of projects, but we are always looking for, effective tax planning ideas. Durgesh Chopra : Got it? Sorry, I was on mute, understood. So, it's more like a 2020 event. You are not modelling that going into 2021. But there may be opportunities, right, is that\u2026 Lynn Good : There are opportunities in 2021, but we expect them to be a bit less than what they were in 2020. Durgesh Chopra : Understood, perfect. And then just maybe quickly on the FFO-to-debt metric, if I have this correct, 2020 or the year past we were targeting 15%. Now it's going to 14% for the next five years and you mentioned there's some question versus sort of what agency thresholds are to kind of protect your rating. Can you just provide us a little bit of where is the floor, so how much cushion do you actually have, versus their credit rating agency metrics? Lynn Good : I'll jump in and Steve can follow-on. The FFO has seen the impact of COVID. We also see the impact of our coal ash settlement with some near-term benefits that we offer to customers. And so, as we look ahead, and speaking to our S&P in particular, the range is 12% to 16%, we believe we'll be very solidly within that range. And continue to believe a strong balance sheet and our commitment to the balance sheet is important. And you see that with the recent GIC transaction. So, I would talk about some of those near-term items that I referenced there. And Steve how would you add? Steve Young : No, I think, that's exactly right. We, certainly, as we look forward, we've got COVID impacts that will continue into 2021 will affect the top line revenues, the coal ash settlement restructured in the fashion that help customers there. But we think we can operate very comfortably within this range at the new rating, and we'll get very adequate access to capital. Durgesh Chopra : Excellent, thank you so much. Great call. Thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. I would like to turn it back over to Lynn Good for any additional or closing remarks. Lynn Good : Well Hannah thank you. And thanks to all of you who joined the call. We've got a lot of news here in 2021, all directed in building a strong foundation for growth in the future. And we look forward to engagement with you in the weeks and months ahead. And of course, the IR team is always available this afternoon if there are further questions.  So, thanks for your interest and investment in Duke Energy. Operator : That concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And now, at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Jack Sullivan. Please, go ahead. Jack Sullivan : Thank you, April. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's first quarter 2021 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information, within the meaning of the securities laws. Actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking statements and those factors are outlined herein and disclosed in Duke Energy's SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found in today's materials and on dukeenergy.com. Please note, the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. So with that, let's turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Jack, thank you and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be with you to share our results and the excellent progress we're making on our strategic initiatives. Today we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 for the quarter, delivering strong results to start the year, driven by growth at our electric utilities. Our first quarter results demonstrate the power of our clean energy strategy and our ability to execute that strategy. We also continue to tightly manage costs that engage stakeholders throughout our business, as we develop and implement smart policy solutions. With the first quarter behind us and a clear path forward, we are reaffirming our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5 to $5.30, with a midpoint of $5.15 and our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2025, based off the $5.15 midpoint. Turning to slide five. Just over a year ago we launched our comprehensive response to COVID-19. And although the pandemic is not behind us, I'm very proud of our response, demonstrating our commitment to health safety and customer service in the face of very difficult circumstances. But as I reflect on the past year, we accomplished so much more. We made the difficult but appropriate decision to step away from the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. We hosted a successful ESG Day, clearly articulating our clean energy vision and how we are pursuing the largest fleet transition in the US. We actively participated in stakeholder meetings in the Carolinas, focused on our clean energy transition and regulatory reforms necessary to recover those investments, laying the groundwork for comprehensive energy legislation. We announced a market-leading transaction with GIC, delivering $2 billion of accretive investment into our company and eliminating the need for equity over the five-year period. We maintained a sharp focus on our cost structure, operational excellence and customer service, delivering industry-leading safety results and surpassing our internal customer satisfaction target by nearly 15%. We outlined an updated five-year $59 billion capital plan and raised our growth rate to 5% to 7%. Further, we achieved numerous regulatory outcomes, including the successful completion of our first rate case in Indiana in 16 years, resulting in multi-year rate increases, accelerated depreciation of coal plants and recovery of coal ash costs. We reached comprehensive settlements in our North Carolina rate cases with a broad range of stakeholders, which have been approved by the NCUC. We reached a comprehensive settlement on coal ash recovery, providing customers with near-term benefits, while establishing recovery with a return in the years to come, which was also approved. And finally, in Florida, we received approval of a new multi-year rate plan, as well as the Clean Energy Connection Program and the first three years of our Storm Protection Plan. In light of these accomplishments, which included eliminating uncertainties and creating a clear vision for growth, the stock has performed well and we're poised to deliver even more in 2021. Turning to slide six. We're leading the way to cleaner energy and continue to make progress toward our 2030 goals and our target of net zero emissions by 2050. Across our jurisdictions, we're engaging with policymakers and stakeholders to accelerate the transition, while keeping a sharp focus on reliability and affordability. I wanted to provide an update on the legislative session in North Carolina. As we discussed in February, ongoing work continues to build alignment on the shared objectives that came out of the Clean Energy Plan process. These shared objectives include North Carolina's clean energy transition, as well as the regulatory reforms that provide for timely recovery of these investments. We are now entering the middle phase of the legislative long session and the legislative process, including opportunities to introduce new legislation is expected to continue into the summer months. We continue to see momentum from a broad range of stakeholders to make progress on these objectives in 2021 and we remain optimistic for comprehensive energy legislation this year, aligned with our shared goals of generation transition and regulatory reforms needed to enable that change. Moving to Florida. Our DEF utility, continue to enjoy robust growth, deliver strong returns and support important energy infrastructure for the benefit of customers. Our constructive relationship with customer and consumer groups has resulted in the advancement of critical infrastructure investments that accelerate our shared clean energy vision. This was clearly demonstrated with the Public Service Commission's approval of our multiyear base rate settlement on May 4. As the commission noted in the ruling, the settlement was the culmination of extensive engagement with many interested parties including the Office of Public Counsel. We appreciate the Commissioner's complementary remarks on our robust process to reach settlement, keeping the interest of all stakeholders in mind and arriving at a fair and equitable rate design. The settlement approval provides clarity through 2024 and includes recovery of significant investments in the grid solar generation and electric vehicle infrastructure. This settlement builds on our Clean Energy Connection solar program and Storm Protection Plan grid program, as we continue to advance our transition to net-zero emissions. Our Florida operation positioned well for the economic rebound continues to build momentum with investments aligned to our clean energy transition. Shifting to Indiana. We're making progress as we move through the state's integrated resource plan process. We've hosted multiple stakeholder sessions receiving input from various interested parties as we collaborate on the path forward, all while ensuring our system remains reliable as we transition to new energy sources. Stakeholders have always been a part of the IRP process in Indiana and their feedback is valuable as we evaluate a number of possible scenarios for future generation. Our filing will be submitted in November of this year, continuing our progress toward the energy transition in the state. At the federal level, we are actively engaged with policymakers on climate infrastructure and tax policy. We support policies that pave the way to net-zero emissions while ensuring customer affordability and reliability. We also support investments in research and development for new clean technologies, which will be critical to achieving net-zero. To that end, we see permitting reform as a solution to help streamline the process to build infrastructure without compromising community involvement and environmental protections. Electrification has also entered the climate discussions and represents an exciting opportunity to address transportation sector emissions. In the months ahead, we expect more clarity in the form and content of these policies, potentially an infrastructure bill, tax incentive extensions, and regulatory proposals among others. We will continue to advocate for policies that support and accelerate our clean energy transition emphasizing the importance and maintaining affordability and reliability for our customers. We will keep you informed along the way. It's important at this early stage, however, to recognize that we see great alignment between our vision of a net-zero clean energy future and the policies that are being discussed. Shifting to slide 7. It's clear our industry is transforming and the pace of change is increasing. Duke Energy is not only keeping pace with this change, but we are at the forefront. Our transition to net-zero is enabled by our growing capital plan, which in the back half of the decade ranges from $65 billion to $75 billion. This range of investment is consistent with our integrated resource plan filings and includes up to 15 to 20 gigawatts of additional renewable investment tripling the amount of renewables on our system by 2030. We are also planning for retirements of seven gigawatts of coal-only capacity, an amount that could increase as policies and regulations continue to unfold in this decade. The ultimate pace of our clean energy transition will be shaped by a variety of factors, including state and federal clean energy regulations and policies. We are actively engaged with policymakers and regulators on this important topic and are prepared to move as quickly as state and federal regulation and policy allow. We remain confident in achieving our carbon reduction and earnings growth goals, as we continue the execution of our clean energy vision creating value for our customers and growth for our investors. Shifting to slide 8. We carried our momentum forward in our environmental social and governance commitments, following our ESG Day and fourth quarter call in February. In April, we released our 15th consecutive sustainability report, outlining our tremendous progress during 2020 and we've reached additional milestones in just the last few months. In March, we retired a 270-megawatt coal unit in DEC, ahead of schedule, marking the 52nd coal unit closed across the enterprise. We also announced the accelerated closure of our Gallagher Station in Indiana, bringing the retirement forward 1.5 years to June of 2021. These decisions place us another step closer to our goal of removing all coal-only units from our portfolio in the Carolinas by 2030 and advances the targets for our Midwest utilities as well. As we retire coal, we are also adding renewables and other clean energy infrastructure across our system. In our Commercial Renewables business, we placed the 350-megawatt Frontier II wind farm in service in Oklahoma during the quarter. And in the regulated business we placed 220 megawatts of solar in service in the Carolinas and Florida. Our electric vehicle strategy remains front and center as we continue to position Duke Energy as a key enabler of mass electric vehicle adoption. With commission approvals in the Carolinas and Florida, we're investing $100 million to implement pilot programs to support decarbonization of the electric sector across the Southeast. And we had joined the Electric Highway Coalition to help expand chartering infrastructure across the nation's highways aligned with many of our peer utilities. I'm also pleased to share that we're one of the first in the industry to release EEO diversity data, as part of our sustainability report, demonstrating not only our commitment to transparency, but also to moving the needle on our diversity and inclusion metrics across the enterprise. Beyond that, we are one of the first in the industry to issue a report detailing our trade association memberships and their positions on climate change. It's these types of disclosures and transparent reporting that have earned us top rankings for investor transparency. And finally last week we announced three new directors to join our Board maintaining a strong focus on diversity, as well as bringing a wide range of backgrounds and skills to the table. Each of these steps highlights our keen focus on ESG priorities and we look forward to sharing additional updates throughout the year as we make progress on our strategy. With the first quarter behind us and a clearly defined strategy ahead of us, I'm confident in Duke Energy's strong growth trajectory and believe our investment plan will deliver sustainable value and 5% to 7% growth over the next five years. And with that let me turn it over to Steve. Steve Young : Thanks Lynn and good morning everyone. I'll start with a brief discussion on our quarterly results highlighting a few of the key variances in the prior year. For a more detailed information on the various drivers and a reconciliation of reported to adjusted results please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. As shown on Slide 9, our first quarter reported earnings per share were $1.25 and our adjusted earnings per share were $1.26. This is compared to reported and adjusted earnings per share of $1.24 and $1.14 last year. Please see our non-GAAP reconciliation including in the earnings release for more details. Within the segments, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure was up $0.15 compared to the prior year. Results were favorable due to benefits from base rate increases in North Carolina, Florida, Indiana and Kentucky weather year-over-year and timing of O&M expenses. Partially offsetting these items were lower retail and wholesale volumes and higher depreciation costs on our growing investment base. Shifting to Gas Utilities and Infrastructure results were flat year-over-year. Results were primarily driven by continued margin growth at the LDCs and new retail rates in Tennessee, offset by the cancellation of ACP last year. In our Commercial Renewables segment, results were down $0.04 for the quarter largely driven by the impact of the Texas weather event. Other was favorable $0.06 for the quarter, principally due to higher market returns and certain benefit plans as well as lower holding company financing costs. Finally segment results are impacted by the allocation of dilution related to the $2.5 billion equity forward that settled in December 2020 which totaled $0.05 for the quarter. Overall, we were pleased with the strong results compared to last year further illustrating how we continue to execute on our business and regulatory strategies. It's these excellent results and our strong start to the year that ensure, we are well positioned to meet the 2021 guidance we shared in February. We remain confident in our ability to consistently grow our adjusted earnings per share at 5% to 7% throughout the 5-year period off of the 2021 base year. Turning to Slide 10. Let me provide an overview of electric volumes and economic trends. Our results for the first quarter were down approximately 1% year-over-year. Keep in mind that we are comparing sales data to a quarter last year that had little impact from COVID-19. Residential volumes were up 2.6% over last year driven by continued strong customer growth in our service territories and ongoing remote learning and work-from-home policies. The winter surge in COVID-19 cases impacted our commercial class, which was down 5% for the quarter. As vaccination rates continue to climb and restrictions ease, we expect a strong improvement in the commercial class through the rest of the year. While industrial volumes were down 2% for the quarter, nearly all of our large commercial and industrial customers have resumed or operations and the sector is showing signs of optimism. The ISM Manufacturing Index, a key indicator of economic activity was 64.7 in March, its highest reading since 1983. As we look back, we continue to expect 1% to 2% load growth in 2021. This is supported by our early look at April volumes which showed strong sales across all customer classes. Our service territories are well-positioned for sustained growth over the long-term. We operate in four of the top eight states for population migration, a testament to the attractive business environments of our service territories and electricity rates well below the national average. In fact, Apple recently announced a $1 billion investment in North Carolina that will bring 3,000 jobs to the research triangle area highlighting the governor's commitment to economic development in the state. Turning to slide 11. We remain active in the regulatory arena engaging stakeholders as we see constructive outcomes and smart solutions for our customers. In North Carolina, we received orders in our DEC and DEP rate cases, which approved key settlements we reached with interveners. These settlements incorporate significant infrastructure investment providing benefits to our customers. The orders include approval of a 9.6% ROE and 52% equity capital structure deferral treatment for approximately $1.2 billion in grid improvement plan projects and resolution of coal ash recovery through early 2030. We have also mitigated customer rate increases with EDIT flowback from the 2018 tax rate change and strong cost securitization. Overall, we are very pleased with the outcomes in these rate cases. As Lynn noted our settlement in Florida was approved last week. The settlement includes investments in renewables and the grid the approval of an ROE band of 8.85% to 10.85% and a 53% equity capital structure. Importantly, the ROE band also includes a trigger mechanism that protects against rising interest rates. Additionally, it approves accelerated depreciation for coal plants and the Vision Florida program which funds $100 million in emerging technologies. Turning to our LDC business. Our Tennessee gas rate case settlement was approved. Looking forward, we expect to complete two rate filings this year. Piedmont filed a North Carolina rate case in March, which includes investments in our Robeson LNG facility, pipeline integrity management and system infrastructure growth to support our rapidly growing customer base. We expect an evidentiary hearing in September and new rates to be effective later this year. And in Kentucky, we submitted our prefiling notice on April 30 indicating our intention to file a natural gas rate case in June. Our ability to execute on our robust capital plan and grow our investment base is underpinned by a healthy balance sheet and solid credit ratings. So far this year, we have raised approximately $1.4 billion in long-term debt for DEC and Piedmont with both transactions pricing at very attractive rates. We expect to close the first tranche of the minority sale of Duke Energy Indiana to GIC by the middle of this year and are on track to complete the North Carolina storm securitization in 2021. The proceeds from the GIC transaction along with our overall financing plan allow us to maintain a strong credit profile without the need for common equity issuances throughout the five-year plan. Looking ahead to second quarter and beyond, I want to provide some perspective on timing considerations for the balance of the year. Our expectations are that volumes will recover over the balance of the year with a 1% to 2% increase over 2020. Having said that, our second quarter will reflect the cancellation of ACP. And as we discussed in the year-end call, we expect O&M to be unfavorable in the second and third quarters due to the significant COVID mitigation actions we took in the spring and summer of 2020. Before we open it up for questions, let me close with slide 13. We remain confident in our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $5 to $5.30 with a midpoint of $5.15. Our first quarter results position us well to achieve full year results within this range, as we continue to invest in important energy infrastructure that our communities value. Our attractive dividend yield coupled with our long-term earnings growth from investments in our regulated utilities provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for shareholders. As Lynn discussed in her opening remarks, we continue to advance our clean energy strategy with a keen focus on affordability and reliability, keeping customers at the center of all we do. Duke Energy is well positioned to lead as the pace of change in our industry accelerates, delivering sustainable value to our customers and investors. With that, we'll open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll first hear from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Shar Pourreza : Good morning, Lynn, Steve. Lynn Good : Good morning, Shar. Steve Young : Good morning. Shar Pourreza : So just touching on the North Carolina legislative process and maybe just following up a little bit on your prepared remarks, Lynn. I mean, obviously recognizing, you guys are in the middle of a lengthy comprehensive legislative process and we know you can't get into too many details here but you seem obviously you're optimistic which is good. But we are coming up on the house filing deadline and the crossover dates and everyone is hyper-focused on sort of these time lines. Can you maybe just elaborate, why you're still optimistic given a very tight window? What's sort of giving you this sense of optimism? Lynn Good : Sure. And Shar thanks for the question. Our optimism is really centered on the broad support for comprehensive energy legislation that exists within the state. We've been talking for some time about the robust process that occurred in 2020 and under the governor's Clean Energy Plan. So the administration, the environmental communities, solar developers, industrial customers, Duke Energy, others have been at the table and there is broad support to move forward in 2021. I think the other thing that's important to note, which I tried to emphasize in the remarks is we're in the middle of the session. But that legislative process which includes the opportunity to introduce bills will continue and is expected to continue well into the summer. So one thing I would just point out is if we think back to 2017, when House Bill 589 was moving, it was actually introduced in June, which was well past crossover dates and then became law at the end of July. So the timing and approach to advance the bill is in the hands of legislative leadership and we remain \u2013 we'll remain patient, as they work through their process. But as I said, we have optimism based on the broad support for this legislation. Shar Pourreza : Got it. So just \u2013 so basically, some time in the summer is when you expect an introduction. Lynn Good : I don't want to point to a specific time frame, Shar but do think we'll have data points to talk about this summer including, we'll be back in front of all of you in early August. The timing is really in the hands of legislative leadership which is where it belongs to advance the bill. And so we'll continue to keep you updated. But the optimism, as I said before, really centers on the broad support. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then just lastly for me. Remind us, what some of the key priorities there are around the legislation and maybe potential treatment we could see come about. I mean so if we're thinking about performance-based rate making, ROE bands, formula rates, rate basing renewables, is everything on the table right now or some facets not palatable? So just a bit of a sense on some of the pushes and takes that you're seeing. Lynn Good : Sure. And Shar, I think all of the things you mentioned kind of fit under the broad objectives, where there's alignment. So transition away from coal, advancing renewables, regulatory and ratemaking reforms. And so when I \u2013 when we use the word comprehensive and you list all of those things underneath, you can see that there are a number of key issues that will be addressed. And so, we'll have more to say as this progresses. The other point I would emphasize is the five-year plan, the 5% to 7%, the 2021 guidance that we've put in front of you is not predicated on a specific outcome of this legislation. It has a more dramatic impact on the back part of the decade as we accelerate the transition into 2030. So, we think good progress is being made and we'll continue to update you. Shahriar Pourreza : Terrific. Congrats on the results. Thank you guys. Lynn Good : Thank you, Shah. Steve Young : Thank you. Operator : And next we'll hear from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning team. Congratulations. Lynn Good : Good morning, Julien. Steve Young : Good morning. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, thank you. Perhaps just to pick up where that last one was left off. Can you provide a little bit more color on how you and legislators are thinking about customer bill implications here? How do you make the legislators comfortable with the rate increases, or how do you think about compromise therein right? You mentioned a number of different specific pieces that constitute this. Just can you elaborate a little bit more? Lynn Good : Sure. And Julien, reliability and affordability have been front and center really dating back into 2020 in the stakeholder process. So, all of the things that we're talking about here around transition, around renewables around regulatory reforms will be looked at within the construct of reliability and affordability and that's appropriate, if you think about the growing economy here in the Carolinas. So that -- those topics are being discussed and should be discussed. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. Excellent. And just to clarify I think I saw this in your remarks, but the introduction of verbiage into any bill here the crossover date seemingly doesn't necessarily matter here. It's really as you said earlier to emphasize the summer time line matters most as you think about a '22 rate case timing right? Lynn Good : '22 rate case, I don't know about that, Julien. We don't have specific plans around the rate case in 2022. But I would -- your point around the summer, the legislative process continues into the summer. And as the calendar lays out in the Carolinas, the long session doesn't have a required end date. So, we'll continue to keep you apprised of the developments in the summer and again remain optimistic. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. Fair enough. The point was there was a broad latitude. Quickly Steve, just if I can ask you to elaborate your comments are intriguing here with respect to load trends. How are you thinking about the 1% to 2% increase, as you've contemplated formally versus your seeming acceleration commentary into April here? Can you reconcile with it just a tad? Steve Keith : Well, we've got a good bit more to learn as we move through the second quarter, but the April results look solid for us. That's one month. I think, as vaccinations roll out and stimulus funding comes into play and so forth, we are seeing the economy pick up. And we're seeing activities at our customer base pick up as well. So, whether the 1% to 2% growth is light or in the ballpark correct, we feel confident with it. We'll update that as we move forward into the next quarter and have a bit more data. But we are encouraged by what we're seeing across our footprint. And we are encouraged by the customer growth, which continues to be high and that underpins it. Lynn Good : Julien, you might have seen on the front page of the journal today, they were highlighting communities that have been benefiting from migration. Greenville, South Carolina is on the list. So, we've continued to see good customer growth and hope to be surprised to the upside, but the 1% to 2% I think is a good planning assumption. We've sized our cost structure to be consistent with that. So we're continuing to manage the business really tightly. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Congratulations. Lynn Good : Thank you, Julien. Operator : Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research has our next question. Steve Fleishman : Yes, hi. Good morning, Lynn and Steve. Lynn Good : Hi, Steve. Steve Keith : Good morning. Steve Fleishman : Hi. So just apologies for beating a dead horse here, but just the legislative process, is there anything to read into the fact that these utility-related bills or clean energy-related bills were not addressed early in the session? Were there certain other priorities that kind of came ahead, or just anything to reason kind of why that happened? Lynn Good : Yes, I wouldn't read anything into it. It's comprehensive energy legislation with a broad group of stakeholders. And one of the reasons I pointed to HB 589, they introduced in June of 2017 is because you may not remember that bill specifically but it included PURPA reform and also included a pathway for renewables over a multiyear period. So, the time line how to advance the bill time frame always within the hands of the legislative leadership and we continue to work with a broad range of stakeholders. But I don't think there's anything specific that I would point to on the timing. We remain optimistic that it will move forward. Steve Fleishman : Great. Okay, great. And then how about an update on the approvals of the Indiana transaction? Just I know you said midyear. Has there been any intervention any process to kind of monitor there? Lynn Good : Sure. Sure. So, two things remain Steve, CFIUS approval and FERC approval. There have been some filings in the FERC docket back and forth Sierra Club CAC others. In our view, the issues that are being raised are not really relevant to what FERC is evaluating. And further there have been strong support from our wholesale customers. And so, we still believe kind of middle of the year is appropriate timing for that. CFIUS has recently notified that they're moving to another phase which is quite common. With the case load that they have to reach agreement within 45 days of approval is increasingly uncommon. So, again, we think midyear is the right time line for both of those approvals and we'll continue to keep you updated. Steve Fleishman : Okay. I guess my last question just could you give us a sense of the IRP schedule just since it kind of could interact with legislation? Just what is the latest on the IRP schedule? Lynn Good : Yes. So, the IRP is moving in two ways, Steve. In North Carolina, there have been public hearings underway. The North Carolina Commission does not approve the IRP, but rather provide feedback. And so, we are on pace to hear from them we believe likely in the fall in North Carolina. And then in South Carolina, there was a hearing that began on April 26. It has wrapped up. South Carolina does approve. This is a part of Act 62 that you may remember from a couple of years ago. We expect an order from them by June 28. And I think what's important in South Carolina is the Office of Regulatory Staff is supportive. In fact, it's complementary of the work that we accomplished with the IRP. And so we believe we'll get good feedback from the South Carolina Commission as well June -- end of June for that timeframe. Steve Fleishman : Okay, great. Okay, thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you, Steve. Operator : And we'll hear from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd : Hi good morning. Lynn Good : Hi Steve. Stephen Byrd : Wanted to just discuss the Indiana IRP, I guess, a little bit more broadly. And I was interested in trying to compare the dynamics in Indiana versus say in the Carolinas. I'm thinking about things like different renewables costs different generation cost structures feedback you've received so far in terms of priorities in Indiana. How would you at a high level sort of characterize some of the maybe differences and similarities as you compare sort of the resource mix and where you may head in Indiana versus say in the Carolinas? Lynn Good : So, Steve, a heavier coal mix in Indiana as you know. Some wind availability in terms of resource capability in Indiana more so than in the Carolinas. Solar is available but would have a slightly different capacity profile than in the southeast as you can imagine. And so, we have been in active conversations in Indiana on the appropriate transition for some time. You may recall that in the rate case that was approved in July, we actually accelerated depreciation shortening the lives of the assets. And the legislature in Indiana has also undertaken a review and a clean energy task force of how the state can keep making progress. And so we see this IRP filing is a way for us to continue discussions with all the parties, how can we accelerate, how can Indiana maintain control of their destiny, how can we bring in renewables in a cost-effective way is there a role for natural gas as we move away from coal. And good conversations are underway and expect to have more to say as we get closer to that filing, Stephen, but I would share with you that we're building on conversations that have been underway in the state for some time. Stephen Byrd : That's really helpful. And maybe just focusing on renewables. And I'm just curious what data points you're seeing in terms of cost of equipment, availability of equipment a common theme among investor discussions is just sort of availability of renewable equipment sort of supply chain sort of stresses along the way. Are you all seeing any sort of data points along those lines, or is it broadly that equipment is available, costs continue to be fairly low? Steve Young : Yes. I'll take that Stephen. We have in our Commercial Renewables business pretty extensive input to the supply chain. And so we have a good diverse set of vendors that we utilize for the various services there. We haven't seen any anomalies or stresses at this point that interfere with our projects and moving them online.  We saw some challenges in 2020 related to COVID and worker availability along the supply chain. But as that has been relieved that has helped move along. We're keeping an eye on increasing price pressures as we are across our entire footprint not just the renewable standpoint. But at this point, we haven't seen anything of what I would call dramatic. Lynn Good : Stephen, the one thing I would add to that, I think is we monitor the acceleration of policy discussions at the federal level. And we also see how our states and customers are moving. We continue to keep our eye on what signs of supply chain are we going to need in order to accomplish all of these objectives. And I think that is going to be something that every utility is looking at.  In the near-term, there could be some pricing pressures as we all try to figure out how to get on our front foot. But I suspect, if there's a lot of support for this growth that supply chains will continue to expand. And we'll look for ways we can find the lowest cost for customers. So it is a front-of-mind issue for us broadly not only for the coming year and projects on the docket, but over the long-term as we look at the size of these capital spending plans that we have in front of us. Stephen Byrd : That's extremely helpful. And maybe just one last one at a high level at the federal legislative level. I'm just curious your take on the prospects for clean energy support is sort of broader legislation that may pass. What is your sense as to the prospects for getting further support for clean energy and perhaps for transmission and other asset classes as well? Lynn Good : Stephen, I think it's early and there are a lot of things being discussed as you know, infrastructure, clean energy policies, tax policy. And so I do think we are encouraged by the conversations around clean tech R&D, electric vehicles, some discussion around permitting reform. Tax policy, we expect to have some incentives around clean energy investment, which will be to the benefit of our customers.  So we remain engaged and we'll know more about how these things take shape over the course of the summer and continue to be encouraged that there might be a bipartisan way to approach infrastructure. I think there's an upcoming bipartisan infrastructure week in early June because I think that could be needed investment in the economy and certainly great for Duke if that were to move forward. Stephen Byrd : Very good. Thank you so much. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : Next we'll hear from Jonathan Arnold of Vertical Research Partners. Jonathan Arnold : Good morning, guys. And thank you\u2026 Lynn Good : Hi, Jonathan. Steve Young : Good morning. Jonathan Arnold : Thanks for the color. So it was reported a while back, Lynn, that the house was sort of the venue that was seen to be taking the lead on the legislation in North Carolina. Is that the case, or is that sort of something that's moving around here? Lynn Good : So the house is taking the lead Jonathan. And all the comments I've made continue remain we're working our way through it. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. And as we've talked about greater flexibility on dates should we be looking for them to sort of formally move any of these dates, or is that just -- it's just more that the process is fluid in a long fashion? Lynn Good : I wouldn't expect the dates that you're referencing like crossover and so on to move, Jonathan. I think the bigger point is that legislation and introduction of bills and amendment of bills and other things can move throughout the legislative session. So it's not dependent on those specific dates. Jonathan Arnold : Thank you. Okay. And just a couple of other things there. Steve, the 1% to 2% sales growth, am I correct that that's the full year number, or is it rather than your sort of balance-of-year number? Steve Young : That's a full year number, Jonathan, and that takes into account what we expected to see in the first quarter of 2021 knowing that there was still some carryforward in winter surge and so forth, but the 1% to 2% is the entire year. Jonathan Arnold : And how does what you did see in first quarter sort of marry up with what you were expecting to see? Steve Young : Given the winter surge, it was not surprising to see the drop there. And so we expected that to occur compared to 2020. So I think it was fairly well in line. What we're encouraged by is the early signs from April and that's just one month quite strong and some of the other indices. So, again, we would feel confident in the 1% to 2%, and we'll see if there's upside to that as we move to the next quarter. Jonathan Arnold : Thank you. And then just finally you said in the 10-K that you thought winter storm Uri was going to be a $75 million to $100 million of pre-tax event for you. And I think the slide showed was a $0.04 hit in the quarter. So that seems to be quite a bit less than you originally thought. Could you just talk about what went on between sort of one date and the other? Lynn Good : Jonathan that's filing was an early estimate. And as we learned more and got more information on how the transactions actually settled and came through the $0.04 is what we experienced. Steve, would you add anything? Steve Young : Yes. That's right. It was a quick and fast look. We needed to get some information out about that on that early estimate, but as we worked with the individual customers and off-takers and tax equity partners, there was different allocations of events and it resulted in less of a loss. Jonathan Arnold : Great. Thanks for that, and\u2026 Lynn Good : Thank you, Jonathan. Operator : And Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Michael Weinstein : Hi. Good morning. Lynn Good : Hi, Michael. Michael Weinstein : Hey, could you also comment on the recent headlines that the Biden administration has support for nuclear, maybe talking about nuclear PTC? I'm just wondering how that affects the calculus in a regulated context in terms of as you apply for license renewals going forward do you see the plants -- do you see federal support as helping or maybe no change from before? Any I'm not sure. Yes. Lynn Good : I think any support, federal support and other support for nuclear is important, Michael. We are big proponents of nuclear power at Duke Energy. If you think about the Carolinas 50% of the energy comes from carbon-free nuclear. And so we are on path to seek second license renewal for all of our plants, and we're also engaged on some new technologies from the standpoint of providing operating experience for the advanced nuclear that we believe will be helpful to get to net zero. And so when I listen to incentives around nuclear that you were referencing, I think, they can be quite important for technology development and for encouraging further expansion of nuclear power as part of the net zero plan. Michael Weinstein : I mean, do you think it changes the discussion around the IRP though going forward? So how much nuclear will be in the future in 2030 and beyond? Lynn Good : It could. I don't think at this early stage it will. Michael one of the things that we're in discussions with the commissions about and the IRP is all of them are based on historic tax policy. So any incentives around extended renewables, nuclear, offshore, wind, transmission all of those would be updates and generally, more cost-effective for customers. So we will continue to update these IRP plans as we go forward. And as I said a couple of times, the support for new technologies we think is really important because as we get kind of to that 70% to 80% carbon reduction working towards net zero, we need technologies we don't have today. And that's where the advanced nuclear could show up carbon capture, hydrogen and other things. So we're big advocates of keeping attention on that and funding in a way that will help those technologies get to commercial scale. Michael Weinstein : And along the same lines RNG, renewable natural gas is there other plans to blend that into Piedmont system? And where do you see -- and how do you see that developing over the next 20 years? Lynn Good : Sure. So we have made some investments Michael and sustain RNG, which makes advanced methane -- uses advanced methane generation technology to produce renewable natural gas from dairy farms. And so we're really working with the technology today with the hope that we can introduce it in our Piedmont system or our system in the Midwest and Tennessee as we go forward. And that coupled with our commitment to net zero methane by 2030 makes a strong statement about our commitment to lowering carbon in our LDC business. Michael Weinstein : Great. Thank you very much. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : Next we hear from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Steve Young : Good morning. Lynn Good : Hi, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Just want to turn over to the Commercial Renewables segment, if I could here. And I just want to see does the Duke Energy Sustainable Solutions rebranding signal kind of an interest to potentially expand this business, or even if the Biden administration, if the plans come through with kind of greater tax incentives on this side, would Duke look to ramp up growth in Commercial Renewables? Lynn Good : The branding Jeremy I would characterize as us being responsive to the market. We have a lot of work going on with large industrial and commercial customers looking for customized solutions as they work to achieve their own sustainability goals. It could take the form of commercial renewables. It could take the form of micro grids. It could take the form of supporting electrification of industrial processes or transportation. And so we have been working with these large customers for some time and thought this would be a helpful way just to bring a comprehensive set of solutions to those customers as we go forward. And I believe that customization is going to be an important part of the decarbonization journey for large industrial commercial customers as we move forward. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That makes sense. And maybe just touching a bit on slide 16, advancing EV infrastructure here. Just wondering if you could talk us through how you think the complete opportunity set is here. Could this represent upside to CapEx as you see it over the next 10 years? Lynn Good : We do see opportunities for more CapEx. And frankly, we see opportunities for more load growth as we -- as customers adopt the technology and we see increasing utilization on the part of our communities and municipalities et cetera. So we have been very active in this Jeremy with conversations around all of our jurisdictions trying to get a base level of infrastructure in place to encourage adoption and then working directly with -- like the City of Charlotte we're partnering with them on electrification and municipal buses working with school districts. Anything that we can do to bring our expertise around electrification to this important transition, I think represents an incredible opportunity for us. All these individuals have sustainability goals. All these communities, many of them have sustainability goals. And then I think as you see the auto manufacturers and others transitioning to electric, we want to have the infrastructure in place to serve those customers. So I think it represents an incredible opportunity. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Make sense. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you. Lynn Good : Thanks so much. Operator : And we'll hear from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey guys, thank you for taking my question. Lynn Good : Hi Mike. Michael Lapides : Hi Lynn Can you remind us what's in 2021 guidance for the change in O&M company-wide relative to 2020? And then how you're thinking about 2022 and beyond O&M growth? Steve Young : Yes. The -- Michael for 2021, the O&M is going to go up compared to 2020. And keep in mind in 2020; we reduced O&M by $320 million roughly through various efforts. $200 million of that is sustainable. But a chunk of that is not sustainable. So you're going to see an absolute increase in 2021 over 2020 in O&M. But the broad trend line of O&M continues to decrease. We've taken it down 1% since roughly 2015, 2016 time frame on a consistent basis. And our goal is to certainly keep it flat to declining as we go forward. And I have confidence in our ability to do that. We've learned a lot from COVID, an entirely new set of efficiencies that we've learned from that that we're going to try to carry forward and broaden. But on an absolute basis, you'll see it go up in 2021 as we have to catch up a few things compared to 2020. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then longer term, do you still see opportunities for material cost synergy or savings, or is the goal just to keep it flattish on 2021 levels? Lynn Good : Michael, I think there continues to be opportunities. Steve talked about some of the learnings from COVID. We're aggressively moving on real estate. As we continue to invest in the grid with new technologies, we're finding O&M savings. And as you think about this clean energy transition moving out of coal there's a natural reduction in O&M that could come there as well. So we continue to find ideas, continue to find ways to really focus on this. And we also see it as a strategic priority for our company to maintain affordable prices for customers as we put this capital to work. So our focus on this is not going to lessen. We're not at the end of anything. We're just continuing to find ways we can drive efficiencies. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you guys. Much appreciate it. Lynn Good : Thank you Michael. Operator : And that does conclude the question-and-answer session for today. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn Good for any additional or closing comments. Lynn Good : Thank you April and thanks to all of you for joining today for your interest in Duke, your investment in Duke. And the IR team is available as always for further questions following this call. So thanks so much. Have a good afternoon. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Duke Energy Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.  At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jack Sullivan, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Jack Sullivan : Thank you, Cody. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's second quarter 2021 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information within the meaning of the securities laws. Actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking statements, and those factors are outlined herein and disclosed in Duke Energy's SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found in today's materials and on dukeenergy.com. Please note the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. So with that, let's turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Jack, thank you, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you for our second quarter 2021 earnings call. Today, we announced strong results for the quarter, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.15. These results, driven in part by economic recovery, also demonstrate the continued strength of our clean energy strategy. We are leading the transition to cleaner energy by adding significant amounts of renewables to our portfolio, hardening the grid through investments in our transmission and distribution assets and collaborating with stakeholders and policymakers to advance supportive energy policy. We have positive momentum going into the second half of the year and are reaffirming our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5 to $5.30. We're also reaffirming our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2025, based off of $5.15 midpoint for 2021. And we remain fully committed to creating value for shareholders by recently increasing our quarterly cash dividend for the 15th consecutive year. Looking ahead, we have a number of strategic milestones that we're working towards the -- we're working toward in the second half of the year. We anticipate the closing of the minority sale of Duke Energy Indiana to GIC announced earlier this year at an attractive premium to our public equity valuation. This transaction satisfies our equity needs for the next five years. We received CFIUS approval in June. FERC approval is the only remaining closing requirement, and we anticipate receiving approval at any time during the third quarter. We continue engaging with stakeholders on important work in the Carolinas on our 2020 IRPs and energy legislation and in Indiana on our 2021 IRP. I will speak further about those in just a moment. And operationally, we have four remaining months of hurricane season, and our team is ready to respond on behalf of our customers. In July, Elsa was our first official storm of the 2021 season. While we had minimal impact in our Florida and Carolinas service territories, we were prepared and restored power quickly to our customers. I'm very proud of our accomplishments to date and we're poised for a strong finish to 2021. Turning to Slide 5. We continue to advance our clean energy transformation powered by our five-year $59 billion growth capital plan. These investments are delivering value for our customers and communities and driving strong growth for our investors. I want to highlight a couple of recent accomplishments. Renewables are playing a major role in our path to net zero. We continue construction on approximately 250 megawatts of new solar projects in North Carolina and Florida that we expect to bring online by the end of this year. And in recent weeks, we commissioned the 144-megawatt Pflugerville solar and 182-megawatt Maryneal wind projects in Texas. With the completion of these two projects, we hit a significant milestone, surpassing 10,000 megawatts of solar and wind resources. This is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employees and strong support we receive from the communities where we operate. In addition to carbon reduction and the benefits of creating a diverse energy infrastructure, solar and wind investments foster economic development, tax revenue and job creation in the areas we serve. This milestone reflects our leadership in clean energy, and we are on track to pass 16,000 megawatts of renewables by 2025 and approximately 24,000 megawatts by 2030. By 2050, renewables will represent 40% or more of our energy mix. Nuclear is also a foundational component of our strategy, providing the largest source of reliable carbon-free energy we have in our system. In June, we submitted our application to renew Oconee Nuclear Station's operating licenses for an additional 20 years, which was accepted by the NRC for review. This is our first subsequent license renewal application among our six nuclear sites in the Carolinas, and the review process will move forward over the next 18 months. Oconee is our largest nuclear station, with three generating units that produce more than 2,500 megawatts of carbon-free base flow generation, enough to power more than 1.9 million homes. Our nuclear fleet provided 83% of the company's carbon-free generation in 2020 and avoided the release of nearly 50 million tons of carbon dioxide. We'll pursue similar extensions for each of our remaining reactors as they approach the end of their respective licensing periods. Our ambitious climate strategy also puts us in a strong position to help other sectors, such as transportation, meet their emission reduction goals. We continue to build out electric vehicle infrastructure in our service territories and one of our subsidiaries, eTransEnergy, was recently named a preferred provider by GM to help its fleet customers transition to electric vehicles. Electrifying vehicles is a win-win approach to reducing carbon emissions from both the electric and the transportation sectors. Turning to Slide 6. We're actively engaging policymakers and stakeholders across our jurisdictions and at the federal level. In North Carolina, the House of Representatives recently passed House Bill 951. This legislation directs an orderly clean energy transition for North Carolina, including mandates to retire 12 coal units at five locations and replace them with cleaner forms of generation, renewed solar programs and modern ratemaking tools to better align clean energy investments with customer needs. We support House Bill 951 and will continue to monitor its progress through the legislative process. North Carolina has a long history of constructive energy policy that was developed by finding common ground, which has helped position the state as a leader in clean energy and in economic development. Advancing this clean energy transition continues to be a priority for the state and its leaders. We also continue to work with the commissions in both North and South Carolina to advance our integrated resource plans. Regulators have been complementary of the extensive stakeholder feedback process and comprehensive data incorporated into the IRPs. In South Carolina, we received an order from the commission requesting additional analysis and modeling, which will be filed later this month. And in North Carolina, the commission plans to hold additional proceedings and will be providing guidance on next steps. This is the first time we've presented multiple generation scenarios in the IRP, and we welcome the opportunity to provide our regulators with more input. In Florida, we received the final order from the commission in June, approving the new multiyear rate plan settlement. The significant agreement includes the continued expansion of utility scale solar, energy storage, new electric vehicle charging station programs and provides rate certainty to benefit customers. Among other things, our investments include 10 new solar power plants across the state that will deliver 750 megawatts of cost-effective renewable energy to customers. This multiyear rate plan is in addition to our Storm Protection Plan, which entails $6.2 billion in grid investments through 2029 to harden and strengthen the grid, protecting it against significant weather events and improving reliability for customers. In Indiana, the commission approves Step 2 from our 2019 rate case, which updates rate base through year-end 2020 and trues up carrying costs back to January 1, 2021. As we prepare to submit our Indiana IRP in November, we continue to engage business customers, consumer advocates and environmental groups to solicit input on transitioning to cleaner generation sources while keeping a sharp focus on reliability and affordability for customers. We took an important step in our last rate case by reducing the depreciable lives for our coal capacity and look to the IRP to continue this progress. We'll collaborate with stakeholders and policymakers to find the best path forward for the state's clean energy transition. Shifting to the LDCs. We've filed rate cases in 2 jurisdictions this year. Across our gas segment, we've worked to keep O&M costs relatively flat during a period of strong customer growth and capital additions. Our Piedmont Natural Gas rate request continues to move through the regulatory process in North Carolina. This request includes construction costs related to our new natural gas storage facility in Robeson County. A hearing is scheduled for September. And if approved, rates would be effective by year-end. In Kentucky, we've made strategic investments to improve the reliability and integrity of our natural gas delivery system and filed a request with the Public Service Commission to recover those costs. We've invested nearly $190 million in a variety of capital projects across Northern Kentucky since we last sought a natural gas base rate increase in 2018. We will present our case to the commission in October. And finally, let me comment on the work in D.C. We're engaged with Congress and the administration on a wide range of issues, including infrastructure, tax and climate policy. The bipartisan infrastructure framework is the subject of much discussion and could serve as a powerful catalyst to modernize our nation's infrastructure. It includes funding for large-scale expansion of charging infrastructure to prepare for and further drive adoption of electric vehicles. And as charging infrastructure grows, so will the need for grid investments.  Innovation will also be a critical part of the journey to net zero because with our existing technologies, we can make important progress, but cannot close the gap. We're pleased to see the framework includes funding to accelerate the development of next-generation clean-energy technologies such as hydrogen, carbon capture and advanced nuclear. Robust and sustained government support is vital to ensure the commercialization of these advanced technologies. It's critical for us to tackle this issue today so the technologies are scalable when we need them. In closing, our continued growth and strong second quarter results were driven by solid execution across all our jurisdictions as we lead the largest clean energy transition in our industry. I'm confident we will continue to build on this momentum to deliver sustainable value and grow earnings 5% to 7% over the next 5 years. With that, let me turn it over to Steve. Steve Young : Thanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a brief discussion on our quarterly results, highlighting a few of the key variances to the prior year. For more detailed information on variance drivers and a reconciliation of reported to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. As shown on Slide 7, our second quarter reported earnings per share was $0.96 and our adjusted earnings per share was $1.15. This is compared to a reported loss of $1.13 and an adjusted earnings per share gain of $1.08 last year. The difference between second quarter reported and adjusted earnings per share is due to the onetime impacts of the initiative to redefine workspace usage in light of what we have learned from COVID. This effort involves consolidation of corporate office space and accommodating a hybrid work environment, resulting in a 60% reduction in square footage and annual savings of approximately $25 million to $30 million. The adjusted earnings per share growth in the quarter continues to be strong, led by Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, which was up $0.24 compared to the prior year. Results were favorable due to benefits from base rate increases, favorable volumes, riders and weather. Partially offsetting these items were higher O&M costs due to COVID-19 mitigation efforts in 2020. Shifting to Gas Utilities and Infrastructure, results were down $0.03, primarily due to the cancellation of ACP last year. In our Commercial Renewables segment, results were down $0.06 for the quarter, driven by lower investments in new renewables projects compared to prior year. This is consistent with our guidance in February, and we expect full year 2021 earnings to be within our $200 million to $250 million range. Other was unfavorable $0.04 for the quarter, principally due to less favorable market returns on certain benefit plans and higher income tax expense, partially offset by lower financing costs. Finally, segment results are impacted by $0.04 of share dilution related to the $2.5 billion equity issuance that closed in December 2020. Overall, we had strong results compared to last year, supported by our continued execution and the rebounding economy. We remain confident in our ability to consistently grow our adjusted EPS at 5% to 7% throughout the 5-year period off the 2021 base year. Turning to Slide 8. Let me provide an overview of electric volumes and economic trends. Our results for the second quarter were up approximately 6.5% year-over-year. Keep in mind, we are comparing sales data to Q2 of last year, which experienced the largest impact from COVID-19. Residential volumes were down 6%. However, given stay-at-home orders during the same period last year, the modest decrease indicates many people continue to work from home on at least a part-time basis. In fact, this quarter's results are more than 4% above the second quarter of 2019, highlighting the continued strength of the residential class which is supported by customer growth across our service territories. As reported on our first quarter earnings call, nearly all large commercial and industrial customers have resumed operations in the sector and the sector is showing signs of optimism. The commercial class has rebounded considerably from prior year with an increase of 11.7%. Retail, dining and recreation were all driving the positive year-over-year comparison as most COVID restrictions have been lifted. Similarly, industrial volumes have increased 11.8% for the quarter, whereas volumes had declined 15% last year. We expect improvement in the commercial and industrial classes as employment recovers and supply chain bottlenecks are resolved. As we progress through the back half of the year, we are monitoring the pace of economic recovery and potential impacts of the Delta variant. At the same time, we are encouraged by the sales trends so far this year, along with strong customer growth across our service territories. With Q2 overall retail volumes returning to Q2 2019 levels, we remain confident in our full year expectation of 1% to 2% load growth for 2021 and are trending towards the top half of that range. On Slide 9, I'd like to share an update on where we are with our financing plan and dividend growth. We remain on track with the financing plan we outlined on the fourth quarter call. The proceeds from the GIC minority interest sale, along with our overall financing plan, allow us to maintain a strong credit profile without the need for common equity issuances throughout our 5-year plan. We are on track to complete the North Carolina storm securitization this fall and we recently issued $3 billion of holding company debt at low attractive rates. Finally, we understand the value of our dividend to our investors. This year marks the 95th consecutive year of paying a quarterly cash dividend and the 15th consecutive annual increase. Moving to Slide 10. I want to provide some perspective on timing considerations for the second half of the year and an update on our cost management efforts. We expect volumes will continue to recover over the balance of the year. But as we saw in the second quarter, we expect O&M to be unfavorable in the third quarter when compared to 2020. This is due to the actions we took to significantly reduce O&M during the pandemic, such as deferred outages at our generating stations. Overall, we reduced O&M $320 million in 2020, equivalent to more than 6% of our non-rider recoverable O&M. On our February call, we shared that we plan to sustain 65% or $200 million of those savings and carry them forward into 2021. We are on track to achieve those savings. This is consistent with our cost management track record since 2016. On a consolidated basis, over the past 5 years, our net regulated electric and gas O&M has declined approximately 1% per year, and we expect this trend to continue. Before we open it up for questions, let me close with Slide 11. We remain confident in our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $5 to $5.30 with a midpoint of $5.15. Our year-to-date results position us well to achieve full year results within this range as we continue to invest in important energy infrastructure to benefit our customers and communities. Our attractive dividend yield, coupled with our long-term earnings growth profile of 5% to 7%, provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for our shareholders. As Lynn discussed, we continue to advance our clean energy strategy, adding new renewable generation and taking steps to extend the lives of our carbon-free nuclear fleet. We continue to engage with state and federal leaders as they work to pave the way for a clean energy future. We're executing our capital plan to support those efforts by investing in our energy grid, all while employing financing solutions that save customers money and add value for shareholders. Duke Energy is well positioned to lead as the pace of change in our industry accelerates, delivering sustainable value to our customers and investors. With that, we'll open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenham Partners. Please go ahead. Shahriar Pourreza : Hey, good morning, guys. Lynn Good : Good morning, Shahriar. Steve Young : Good morning. Shahriar Pourreza : So I appreciate your prepared remarks around House Bill 951, Lynn. Where are we in the process as it stands today? Are you still optimistic? I mean, couldn't help but notice some of the lack of bipartisanship going on. Should we be sort of concerned here at this stage? Lynn Good : Sure. The bill is moving and we are encouraged by what we're seeing. I think you know that it passed the House. We've seen support from Senate leadership, the energy legislation remains a priority, and the Governor has been clear for some time about his strong commitment to carbon reduction and to renewable investment in the State. So we're encouraged that the legislative branch, executive branch and all of the broad stakeholders involved in this process will find common ground. And that has been the long history in North Carolina, bringing diverse parties together in advancing energy policy. Shahriar Pourreza : And just -- I want to just elaborate a little bit around sort of the common ground. And I know this isn't obviously a Duke Energy bill and there's a lot of stakeholders involved, but passage of it is going to obviously impact your clean energy transition, right, in the state. Investors kind of want to know if there is a possibility of compromise, i.e., between the draft bill versus legislators' versus the Governor's very vocal comments, right? It's not really your call, but could we see a faster coal retirement outlook, maybe a little less dependency on gas, a bit more solar? I mean the governor wants more. So do you see a path forward to kind of maybe bridge this sort of bid ask that's out there? Lynn Good : Yes, Shahriar, we do. And I think your comments around -- it's comprehensive, there are many elements to it, you have a broad range of stakeholders, it is natural and expected that there are going to be different points of view in that conversation. And what HB 951 does is it outlines a path to a clean energy transition. And the discussion is centering around that pace, the cost, maintaining reliability. And we would expect that legislators and the administration will evaluate all portions of this draft bill to find the right balance. So I think advancing clean energy transition remains a priority for the state and its leaders as well as its broad range of stakeholders, and we will keep you informed as the bill continues to move. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. Congrats on the quarter. Lynn Good : Thank you. Thank you, Shahriar. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Lynn Good : Hi, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning. Can you hear me? Hey, thanks for the time. Lynn Good : We can hear you. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So at risk of asking more on the legislation, perhaps I can pivot a little bit more strategically, if you don't mind. And I'd love to hear if you have any latest thoughts with regards to undertaking any further review of the company. I know that there's been a lot of, shall we say, noise out there. And would love to hear your latest thoughts there in. I'll leave it as open ended as you'd like to comment. Lynn Good : Sure. Julien, I assume that's a comment about Elliott Management. And so let me just answer it in that context and then we can take it any place you want to go. We regularly engage with our shareholders. We regularly review our portfolio, our operations and business strategy. And it has -- our approach around engagement has been similar with Elliott. And we have been in discussions with them for over a year, comprehensively reviewing all of the ideas, engaging advisers when we need to, discussing with our board, all of these ideas. And it's not appropriate for me to comment any further on the specifics, but I would confirm to you that we remain open to a constructive engagement, we'll evaluate all proposals, act on those we believe delivers value to our stakeholders. And I would also say that we remain focused on the serving of customers, maintaining our assets, advancing the strategic priorities around our clean energy transition, and that remains unchanged as well. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. Thank you for this answer. Perhaps if I can pivot a little bit differently here as you think about the nonutility side of the business. Can you comment at all on just thoughts on scaling that or not? Obviously, it's not been too core of a focus of late, but given some of the pressures across the wider renewable businesses out there, would be curious what you're seeing, if that's impacting any of your timelines and/or aspirations in the business put all together. Lynn Good : And Julien, we just crossed an important milestone of renewables, so 10,000 megawatts of renewables, which includes both regulated and nonregulated investment. And we see the growth of renewable energy is important to the clean energy transition. Our commercial team continues to deliver. They are forecasting to achieve $200 million to $250 million per year and have been consistent in accomplishing that. So it remains an important part of the company. It remains an important part of our commitment around carbon reduction, our ESG story in general. And the team is on track to deliver in 2021, 2022 and beyond. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. Excellent. And just to clarify, do you intend to wish you would get this legislation done? I know it's always difficult to say, but any updated thoughts at the end of the forecast period how that might change as you've refined your planning. Might be a little bit early and I know it's transient what could ultimately be included, but I figure -- I'd be remiss if I didn't ask. Lynn Good : Sure. No. Julien, the plan that we've put in front of you, 2021 to 2025, is not dependent on legislation. We have a high degree of confidence in the ability to achieve our 5% to 7% growth rate. But as we talked about in October of last year and we opened the horizon to what the back half of the decade could look like, we do see acceleration of capital not only in pursuit of retirement of assets and building replacement generation, but also our grid investment as well. So we'll continue to update this in the ordinary course, giving you a view in February of what we think 2026 looks like, but we continue to expect acceleration of capital in the back half of the decade. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. All right. We\u2019ll clarify that later. Thank you so much. Best of luck here. Lynn Good : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research. Jonathan Arnold : Hi, good morning, guys. Lynn Good : Hi, Jonathan. Steve Young : Good morning. Jonathan Arnold : Just on the North Carolina process, in the last quarter when you sort of dissuaded us from being overly concerned about any particular dates, but could you just remind us sort of what the timing in the legislature is through the rest of the year? And just anything we should be looking out procedurally? Or is it essentially open ended? Lynn Good : Sure. Jonathan, what I would say is that the timing is difficult to predict in these processes. It is within the hands of the legislative leadership. And we will know more as the bill progresses through the Senate. There was, in fact, a hearing this morning in the Senate, so we'll continue to keep you updated. I think you know that the long session in North Carolina does not have a statutory end date. So we will continue to monitor as it moves through the Senate process. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. Thank you for that. And then just -- I know just a comment on feeling that you're trending towards the top half of the sales or load forecast for this year. Does that sort of translate into how you feel you're tracking on earnings as well? Or are there other things that are weighing on the other side? Lynn Good : Jonathan, we will reset and give you a finer look at where we were trending in the guidance range after third quarter. I mean there's just so much weather volatility here in the Southeast. We have hurricane season underway. So we will continue to monitor that and give you an updated third quarter.  But I would say we're off to a strong start. Strong start on the economic rebound, strong start on maintaining our focus on O&M, delivering on our key milestones around regulatory approvals, et cetera. So I'm pleased with where we are and also pleased to see the economic recovery. Those strong results in commercial and industrial are indicative of the economy opening up, and I think that's a good thing. Jonathan Arnold : Great. And just one very quick one. On the annual savings you talked about for the office reconfiguration, were those -- is that a pretax or after-tax number, the $25 million to $30 million? Steve Young : That's a pretax number, Jonathan. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman : Lynn and Steve, so this may have -- I think this may have been asked a little bit, but just wanted to better clarify the -- as we're watching the IRP and the different scenarios that come out, how should we think about what's embedded in your current capital plan versus what might be incremental? Or is it just mainly focused on beyond the current capital plan? Lynn Good : So Steve, the capital plan is basically the base of the IRP. And so you should think about it that way. The 6 scenarios, as you move further to the right and you introduce additional technologies in the time frame, that's where the legislation begins to come in, giving us some flexibility to move more rapidly on some of the retirements, et cetera. So when we talk about the implications of how IRP fits with the legislation, we've got a clear line of sight 2021 to 2025 based on present law, based on the present processes, present regulatory processes. And the opportunity really exists in the back half of the decade. So that's how I would respond. I don't know, Steve, if you'd add anything to that. Steve Young : Yes. So I think as you move towards a more rapid decarbonization number, then the capital increases. I think within our current 5-year plan, the upside would be at the back end of things. I would give that texture to it. Operator : We'll hear next from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : Most of my questions have been answered. Just maybe a big picture, Lynn, sort of what are -- sort of what are you and some of the other utility leaders looking at Washington, infrastructure bill sort of is being debated today and then the reconciliation bill going into year-end. Maybe sort of what are sort of the top 2 or 3 things that you see coming out between now and year-end which impacts the sector? Lynn Good : Yes, Durgesh, I would say the infrastructure bill will continue to make its path. We're supportive of a bipartisan approach. I think as an infrastructure builder, our success over many years has been in a bipartisan framework. We're encouraged by the focus on electric vehicles and electric vehicle infrastructure. As you know, that's been a priority for Duke. We have about $100 million targeted on that investment and there's certainly potential to expand it. The President today also has been advocating for 40% to 50% of vehicles -- electric vehicles by 2030. We are also pleased to see investments in 0 and low-carbon technologies, like advanced nuclear, hydrogen, carbon capture, because we believe those technologies are important for a net 0 world. So that's what I would say around infrastructure. I think on the remaining, the reconciliation process, tax policy, climate legislation are all being discussed. I think it's too early to tell how those shape up. But we are engaged with the administration and with Congress, really talking about the tools that would be helpful for us to pursue our clean energy strategy and see a lot of alignment over time. But as you know, in a tight Senate and House, it can be challenging at times to find the right path. But we remain engaged. Operator : We'll hear next from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Jeremy Tonet : Just want to start off here. When thinking about the energy transition kind of from a different perspective, I know Duke has some irons in the fire with regards to RNG investments. But do you see any potential to kind of upsize this, increase this over time? Are there policies out there at the federal state level that could be helpful in these efforts? Lynn Good : We are getting started, I would say, Jeremy, on RNG. It's consistent with our overall climate targets. Certainly, our goals, 100% methane goal, et cetera, and are working actively to learn more about the technology, learn more about how it impacts our system and have made some very strategic investments. And so I do think there's an opportunity for it to develop over time. And the team is working actively with policymakers, with the communities, suppliers that would be relevant to this. And I think it will be a bigger story as we move forward. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. And then could you give any more color, just kind of pivoting here, on what we should be looking for with the IRP filing in Indiana later this year? What are some of the considerations versus maybe what we saw coming out of the Carolinas last year? Lynn Good : It's a really good question, Jeremy, because we are in the midst of stakeholder engagement in Indiana as well, engagement with the environmental community, with our large customers, certainly the regulators and other policymakers who are relevant to that process. The goal is decarbonizing. The goal is diversifying.  And if you look at our last IRP that we filed in Indiana, we had about 2,300, 2,400 megawatts of solar starting in 2023, we would expect that to grow. And so we've got a couple of more months here in working through the stakeholder process, but we see this as a next step where we -- in the rate case, we accelerated retirement dates of coal plants. The IRP gives us a chance to expand that discussion on the clean energy transition over the next 20 years. And I think it's an important part of the ongoing conversation in Indiana on how the state will position itself for growth in the clean energy transition. So more to come on that. And as we look forward to November, third quarter poll, EEI, et cetera, we'll have more that we can share around Indiana. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful. Just a real quick last one for me. We very recently seen some utility peers beef up their corporate governance with certain actions. I was just wondering if Duke has considered taking actions like this. Lynn Good : I think Duke has a strong track record on governance, Jeremy. If you were to look back at the feedback we've received from shareholders and the additional disclosures and adoption of certain practices that we followed, we have been very open-minded about these and we'll continue to do so. So that becomes a key focus here in the fall as we engage with shareholders, specifically focused on ESG topics. Our Corporate Governance Committee is very involved in that. The Board is very involved in some of the conversations with shareholders as well. So you can expect us to continue to be responsive to our shareholders in this regard. Operator : We'll hear next from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Lynn, just curious, how are you all thinking about the commercial power business and what the growth profile of that business looks like over the next couple of years relative to investing in renewables in the regulated business? I guess to simplify, what's a better return on capital, investing in renewables outside of the regulated utility or within the regulated utility if you could allocate capital only to one of those alternatives? Lynn Good : Michael, it's a really good question because we have -- we do a lot of work around capital allocation. Of course, what meets the needs of our customers, what fits the policy of our state, what delivers the highest return, those are all key considerations. And our Commercial Renewables business has performed well against our benchmarks of what we expect from that business in terms of returns.  But what you're suggesting is, as we see more opportunity in the regulated business, how will that impact commercial, and I would say that will be very closely reviewed as part of our capital allocation plan going forward. I think you also know that we entered a joint venture with John Hancock on the commercial renewable business, recycling that capital in the way that it's been quite effective, and those are the types of transactions we will also evaluate over time. We like the business in the context of our ongoing ESG story and our pursuit of carbon reduction, but we'll closely scrutinize how capital is allocated. Michael Lapides : Got it. Also, one follow-up. A number of your peers, some of the other large caps, think Exelon or AEP, have made investments in -- they're almost like venture capital-like investments in various clean energy-related companies, some of which have gone public in the last 6 to 12 months. Just curious, does Duke have similar type of investments and have you ever made any disclosure? And are any of them material or something that would show up in kind of the income statement over time? Lynn Good : So Michael, we are active in this area and do make investments. Let me ask Steve to comment. We look at it from a couple of perspectives. Certainly, there's an opportunity to earn a return. But as importantly, there's an opportunity to learn about what's going on in various technology developments and various methods of technologies to serve customers, technologies that could advance carbon reduction. And as part of our treasury corporate development organization, we are focused on investment in that area in a way that complements our business. Steve Young : Yes. I would add that we have made investments in various venture funds, and we work closely with the fund managers to understand what the investment profile is. And as Lynn said, it's aligned with our strategy. It looks at things like EVs and new technologies. And we also ensure that there is communication among our operating folks with the funds and the companies that we invest in. So we can transfer learnings there. And we've had some good success there. It's not been material, but we're certainly learning a lot from them. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Anthony Crowdell : Lynn, Steve, just, I guess, a quick question. Earlier in the year, Duke had been able to resolve rate case in North Carolina. Florida, I think, last year you resolved Indiana. But just are there any other Duke properties or Duke utilities underearning you're allowed and maybe creating more of a headwind than you thought versus when you went in the year? I think you provided some disclosure on the fourth quarter slide deck of maybe adjusted book ROEs going into the year. Just -- is everyone on target? Or is some of them may be performing better than you thought or less than you thought? Steve Young : Anthony, they're performing well. We do look over time at our allowed returns. And we've got a good history across our footprint of earning at or even above our allowed returns. And they'll move around a bit as you're building a rate base for an upcoming rate case. So you'll see some movement around a return based upon some of those profiles. But we feel good about our regulatory cadence and our investments around that cadence. And the execution has been good. The Indiana case and the Carolinas case are coming through nicely. And we're preparing for the future cases that Lynn was discussing. And we think that process is working well. Lynn Good : And Anthony, I would just add that Steve runs a tight process around optimizing capital to make sure it's getting spent at a time that matches with that regulatory calendar. So we do all that we know to do to minimize lag. And the result of that is that we have a good track record of earning our return. Anthony Crowdell : Great. And just a last one for me. You may have touched on it earlier, Lynn, on a question, I think, on maybe some stuff going on in Washington. There's talk of maybe a nuclear legislation or some maybe subsidy for nuclear plants. You're talking about license extension on Oconee. Just any thoughts to maybe your view on nuclear legislation that may be part of the infrastructure bill. And would it impact Duke? Lynn Good : So Anthony, we are strong supporters of nuclear, as you know. And I think, as you look here in the Carolinas, in particular, 50% of the power comes from nuclear across the entire enterprise. 80% of our carbon-free generation is from nuclear. So we are very active. We intend to pursue second license renewal as you indicated. And the discussion in Washington has really centered more around the plants that are exposed to markets, commercial markets. So think about plants in PJM and otherwise. But we have had discussions with a number of people about the importance of nuclear in the transition, and I do believe it is being recognized by the administration and by Congress. And so that's an important area of advocacy for us, not only in existing plants, but on new technologies that would keep nuclear as part of the solution set for the clean energy transition. Operator : And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would turn the conference back over to Lynn Good for closing remarks. Lynn Good : Well, thank you, Cody, and thanks to all of you who participated today for your interest and investment in Duke Energy. And as always, we're available for further discussion, the IR team, Steve and I as well. So thanks again for participating. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And now at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Jack Sullivan, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jack Sullivan : Thank you. April Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Duke Energy's third quarter 2021 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair, President, and Chief Executive Officer, along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information within the meaning of securities laws. Actual results may be different than forward-looking statements, and these factors are outlined herein and disclosed in Duke Energy's SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found in today's materials and on duke-energy.com. Please note the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. So with that, let's turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Jack, thank you. And good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you for our third quarter 2021 earnings call. Today, we announced strong results for the quarter with adjusted earnings per share of a $1.88 driven by growth at our electric utilities. We're well-positioned, for a solid finish to the year and are narrowing our full-year guidance range to 515 to 530, raising the midpoint into the upper half of our original range. We're also reaffirming our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2025 based off our original 2021 guidance range. Before I hand it over to Steve for a financial update, I'd like to discuss the important progress we've made on our climate goals, and highlight reasons and critical accomplishments that help advance our clean energy transformation. Turning to Slide 5, we've been actively engaged with policymakers and stakeholders across the Carolinas, for several years, to chart a path toward cleaner energy. Our 2020 IRPs,filed in both states, reflects our goal to pursue an orderly energy transition. aggressive carbon reduction while maintaining affordability and reliability. These filings and ongoing conversations in both states have been informed by robust stakeholder engagement and feedback. In October, North Carolina took an additional step, consisting with -- consistent with their longstanding history of proactively tackling complex energy issues. When state leaders came together to pass a landmark bipartisan law, House Bill 951, that accelerates the clean energy transition. House Bill 951 provides the framework to achieve 70% carbon reduction by '23 while continuing to prioritize affordability and reliability for customers. It also sets into law our corporate goal of net 0 carbon emissions by 2050. The road map to achieve these goals will come in the form of a carbon reduction plan, which will be approved by the North Carolina Utilities Commission by the end of 2022. We anticipate the active involvement of South Carolina in this process as they have been over the decades in developing and retiring assets that serve both states. The plan will also be informed by stakeholders, a continuation of the conversations that have been ongoing over the last several years, Consistent with the vertically integrated utility model, House Bill 951 calls for utilities to own new-generation or other resources selected by the commission, with the exception of solar generation, which contemplates 55% utility ownership and the remaining procured through PPAs. Throughout our history, we have offered rate protections for low income customers and House Bill 951 takes further steps to prioritize affordability. The legislation calls for securitization of 50% of sub-critical coal plants upon their early retirement, which will lower customer rates. Additionally, we've initiated a low income collaborative to propose new low income programs to further help our customers. The legislation also adopts modern regulatory mechanisms in North Carolina, including multi-year rate plans, performance-based rate making, and residential decoupling, all designed to better align utility investments with customer needs and improve rate certainty. As we look ahead our pace of change will accelerate, as we work toward our carbon reduction goals and the broad er clean energy transformation, across all of our jurisdictions. With this in mind, we expect our enterprise capital plan for the next 5 years, through 2026, to increase to the $60 and $65 billion range. And then moving into the back -half of the decade, we estimate to be in the top-half Of our $65 to $75 billion range. And we will provide more details on our updated capital and financing plans on our fourth quarter call in February. Turning to Slide 6, it's been one year since we hosted our first ESG Investor Day, where we laid out several targets and our path to net 0 carbon and methane emissions. We're making meaningful progress across these goals while also advancing social responsibility and corporate governance work. We exceeded 40% carbon reduction across the enterprise in 2020, and we continue to accelerate coal retirements and add significant amounts of renewables to our system. Our path to net-zero is underpinned by strong governance, collaboration with stakeholders, and a culture rooted in diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our long-term investment strategy also provides societal benefits, as demonstrated by our commitment to environmental justice. Earlier this week, we launched a new sustainable financing framework to help fund investments in eligible green and social projects. This framework provides additional transparency around our investments and clearly defines projects aligned with our ESG priorities. And as a testament to our strong culture of governance and accountability, we were recognized by Labrador's 2021 Transparency Awards as the number one utility for overall transparency. While there is more to do, we are proud of our progress and are poised for more in the years ahead. We look forward to holding another ESG day with you in 2022 to dive deeper into our commitments and our accomplishments. Turning to slide seven, we continue to work with stakeholders at federal, state, and local levels to make this clean energy vision possible while maintaining reliability and affordability for customers. In South Carolina we filed a modified IRP, at the end of August, incorporating feedback from the Public Service Commission and demonstrating further progress toward cleaner energy. The plan includes the balanced resource [Indiscernible] expanding renewable generation storage, retiring coal, and achieving significant carbon reductions. We expect an order from the commission later this year, and believe this filing is an important foundational element to the continued conversation on the pace and approach to the clean energy transition in the Carolinas. Strategic progress continues in Florida as well. We announced four new solar projects in the third quarter as part of our Clean Energy Connection program. And we continue to harden the grid through our Storm Protection Plan Writer. As we prepare to submit our Indiana IRP later this month, we've gathered input from business customers, consumer advocates, and environmental groups on transitioning to cleaner generation, while keeping a sharp focus on reliability and affordability. The IRP will continue to advance efforts to shift away from coal, and we remain engaged with stakeholders and policymakers to find the best path forward for the state. Finally, we're engaging with Congress and the administration on a wide range of issues, including infrastructure, tax, and climate policy. We support new federal policies that align with our clean-energy transition by modernizing and investing in the nation's infrastructure and helping to fund the development of advanced Clean Energy Technologies. From a regulatory point of view, we are pleased that FERC has accepted the application filed by Duke and the other members of the Southeast Energy Exchange Market known as SEEM. This allows the members to proceed with the development of the trading platform. SEEM is a low-cost, low-risk way to provide immediate customer benefits to our shared market structure while advancing more renewables throughout the Southeast. In closing, the fundamentals of our business are strong and we're meeting our financial and strategic objectives while continuing to focus on operational excellence. We operate in constructive jurisdictions that continue to draw new customers at growth rates above national averages. Our climate goals are driving our investment strategy and long-term planning, and we continue to make progress on all fronts. We have a clear line of sight to achieving our 2030 goals. Over this decade, we will deploy one of the largest capital investment plans in the country, focused on building clean-energy infrastructure. Investments that will benefit the environment, our customers and communities, and our investors. With this positive momentum, we are highly confident in our 5% to 7% EPS growth range, and see the potential over time to earn in the top half of this range. With that, let me turn it over to Steve. Steve Young : Thanks, Lynn. And good morning, everyone. I'll start with a brief discussion of our quarterly results, highlighting a few of the key variances to the prior year. For more detailed information on variance drivers and a reconciliation of reported to adjusted results, please refer to the supporting materials that accompany today's press release and presentation. as shown on slide eight, our third quarter reported earnings per share was $1.79 and our adjusted earnings per share was $1.88. The difference between third quarter reported and adjusted earnings per share is primarily due to a charge related to the 2018 South Carolina rate cases, partially offset by proceeds from the settlement with insurers on coal ash basin closure costs. The adjusted earnings per share results in the quarter continued to be strong, led by electric utilities and infrastructure, which was up $0.10 compared to the prior year. Results were driven by favorable volumes, benefits from base rate increases, and riders. Partially, offsetting these items were O&M costs when compared to 2020 levels due to COVID-19 mitigation efforts in the prior year. Shifting to gas, utilities, and infrastructure results were flat to last year. In our Commercial Renewables segment, results were up $0.02 for the quarter driven by investments in the Marriott Neo wind and Pflugerville solar projects. Other was unfavorable, $0.03 for the quarter, principally due to higher income taxes expense. Recall in 2020 that we executed tax optimization levers as part of our COVID mitigation strategy. Finally, segment results are impacted by $0.08 per share of diluted -- dilution related to the $2.5 billion equity issuance that closed in December 2020. Overall, we are pleased with the results for the quarter supported by our continued execution and the rebounding economy. We remain confident in our ability to consistently grow our adjusted earnings per share at 5% to 7% throughout the 5-year period off of the 515 point -- midpoint of our 2021 guidance range. Turning to slide 9, we are pleased to see our electric volumes continue to bounce back as the economic recovery progresses. Results for the third quarter were up approximately 3.4% year-over-year. And for the second consecutive quarter, results are near or above pre -pandemic levels with the third quarter up 1.3% versus 2019. Looking more closely at the customer classes, residential volumes were down 0.2% for the quarter, as people began to return to the workplace. We continue to see strong customer growth of 1.7% year-to-date. When comparing this quarter's residential volumes to that of 2019, we see that volumes have risen almost 4%, highlighting the continued strength of the residential class. The robust labor market recovery in our service territories is driving the improvement in the commercial and industrial classes. Commercial volumes are up 5.3% and industrial was up 7.2%, in our four largest states, representing nearly 90% of our overall electric volumes. Job recovery is outpacing the national average. This is a testament to the attractive jurisdictions in which we operate. We continue to monitor the impact that our largest customers may experience due to supply chain disruptions. And today, we have seen only minor impacts in certain sectors, such as suppliers of the automotive industry. We serve a diverse customer base, expanding a variety of industries, mitigating sectors specific impacts. As we progress towards the end of the year, we are encouraged by the sales trends we have seen, bolstered by strong customer growth across our service territories, which support load growth over the long term. With our rolling 12-month retail load growing at 2.1%, we expect to finish ever above the top end of our original 1% to 2% load growth range for 2021 on Slide 10, I'd like to discuss primary growth drivers for the next year. Beginning with the electric utilities segment, we see higher load in 2022 across our jurisdictions as the economic recovery progresses. In Florida, we will see the impact of the first base rate increase in our multiyear rate plan that was approved this year. We also expect growth from Storm Protection Plan Rider in the final projects recovered under the solar base rate adjustment mechanism. In the Carolinas, we expect to see growth through our grid improvement plan, allowing us to defer certain grid projects with a return between rate cases. Meanwhile, 2022 will be a key year to move through rule making related to HB 951, and the carbon reduction plans, setting the stage for 2023 and beyond. In the Midwest, we'll see the impact for our Ohio distribution rate case beginning in the summer. And we'll continue to invest in transmission and distribution upgrades that are recovered under our rider programs in both Indiana and Ohio. We continue to make progress on our cost management efforts across our jurisdictions, and expect low year-over-year O&M in 2022. Shifting to the gas segment, we will have a full-year benefit from the Piedmont, North Carolina and Kentucky rate cases. We will also see growth from integrity management, investments and customer additions. Consistent with this historical practice we will provide 2020 to 2022 earnings guidance, our detailed capital plan, and our growth prospects for the future during our February financial updates. Before we open it up for questions, let me close with Slide 11. We are having an outstanding 2021 as evidenced by another strong quarter. And we have narrowed our 2021 adjusted earnings-per-share guidance range to the top half of our range. Our attractive dividend yield coupled with our long-term earnings growth profile of 5% to 7% provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for our shareholders. As Lynn discussed, we have a long runway of capital investment opportunities as we advance our clean energy strategy over the next decade and beyond. Duke Energy is well-positioned to lead as the pace of change in our industry accelerates, delivering sustainable value to our customers and investors. With that, we'll open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Also, if you're using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Once again, star one at this time and we will first hear from Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : Good morning, guys. Lynn Good : Hi, Shahriar. Steve Young : Good morning. Shahriar Pourreza : Someone. Just couple of questions on 951, obviously it's good, it finally got done in a bipartisan way. Obviously 22 is going to be busy and you do have some good amount of what to chop, though it's a really good framework. Remind us on next steps, especially as we're thinking about the rule-making, securitization, and the carbon reduction plan. Lynn Good : Sure. Shahriar thank you. And we're pleased that the leaders of the state came together in this bipartisan way to provide the framework that we are going to be talking about. And in many ways, it's the combination of the process we've discussed with you over the last several years as we've worked toward this clean energy transition. The next step, which is already underway, is rule making around the performance-based rate making and securitization. The commission has outlined a process that should culminate in February for PBR and an April for securitization. And then we would also expect the commission to establish procedures around the shaping of the Carbon Reduction Plan. That is not yet out, but we would expect it to occur as you know, the timeline for that is December of 2022. So a lot of work will go on as this legislation transitions into the regulatory arena. We will be involved, of course, stakeholders will be involved, and on the carbon reduction plans, South Carolina will be a very important stakeholder at the table every step of the way. And so we'll be anxious to provide updates along the way as we reach those milestones. But I feel like this is a very good process to put us on a path to achieve not only our carbon reduction goals, but meaningful investments that will drive returns over this decade and beyond. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. And Lynn, lastly, I want to tease it out a bit of your -- prepared comments around the growth guide as we're thinking about various drivers at the legislation and now it impacts your plan. You obviously have more regulated renewable opportunities. You should theoretically have less lag and more opportunities to increase and accelerate capex as the plan further cements, right? You obviously have opportunities around PBR and sharing mechanisms. So if you were solidly within your 5% to 7% growth rate without legislation, especially with an improving load backdrop as Steve clearly highlighted, how can the legislation, I guess not be accretive to your current guide from an EPS growth standpoint? Lynn Good : Sure. I appreciate the question and I think we should broaden it really beyond the Carolinas to also note the progress that we expect to make another jurisdictions. We have important IRP filing coming up in November, end of this month in Indiana, which will Is that a pace for the transition. So taking all of those things together, we do see increased capital. And as we open up 2026 and establish a 5-year range, we believe that capital will go to 60 to 65 as we look at the back half of the decade we had shared 65 to 75. We think it's more likely to be in that top half, 70 to 75. And so we do believe we have the potential over time to earn at the top end of our 5% to 7% range, the top half that 5% to 7% range. And so we have some work to do with rulemaking and beginning the execution. But we have a long runway of capital investment and this regulatory modernization will be helpful, not only to align investments with benefits to customers, but also to allow us to more effectively put capital to work and deliver returns. Stephen Byrd : Perfect. I appreciate it. Thank you so much, Lynn. See you soon. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : And next we'll hear from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd : Hi, good morning. Lynn Good : Hi, Steven. Steve Young : Good morning. Stephen Byrd : I wanted to just maybe build a little bit on the prior questions in terms of just federal legislation supporting renewable energy in a number of ways. And both -- I guess, I'm thinking specifically in North Carolina, as well as Indiana. In Indiana [Indiscernible] you have a resource filing by the end of this month. And then in North Carolina though, it does feel like the deliberation around the cadence of decarbonization is going to flow well into 2022. And to the extent that this legislation does pass, as it extends support for solar and wind, provides support for storage, how might that impact the thinking, not just for you, but for other stakeholders in both of those states? Lynn Good : I believe there's a lot of conversation going on. Steven in both Indiana, in Florida, in the Carolinas around the clean energy transition. And that has been building over the last several years and so you see increasing opportunities for renewable investment, for storage investment, energy efficiency, demand response investment will be a part of it. In some of our states also, a keen interest in getting a base amount of electric vehicle infrastructure in place. And so I do believe the momentum is picking up, of course, all states are watching what's going on at the federal level. And the tax incentives, in particular, can be additive to our progress in the states. And so I see a great deal of alignment between what we are trying to accomplish, where our states are going, and the discussions that are underway in Washington. Stephen Byrd : That's helpful and to the extent that we do see this level of support from federal legislation, could that potentially lead to kind of a further acceleration? I wouldn't imagine anytime soon for your capital plan, but kind of later in the decade. It's obviously an impressive amount of capex that you have. But could this essentially result in an acceleration? Or -- I know that's very tough to predict, but how might that impact your longer-term capital spend levels? Lynn Good : Steve, and I certainly think it can result in acceleration. And that gets down to the target and the timeline that's being established. And I know a lot of debate will occur around those 2 items. Affordability is another factor that we need to keep into the equation. And we have affordability, reliability kind of top of mind as we pursue these goals. But I do believe transition of the bulk power system, both generation and grid is underway with a lot of tailwinds behind it. And we are trying to proceed in a way that works for our states, our customers, the economy. But along the way, importantly, it will deliver meaningful investments for our investors. And so I do see just a long runway of investment opportunity operating and in all of these states, driven by both state and federal tailwinds. Stephen Byrd : Good. Very clear. Understood. And then maybe just one other element of the legislation is the -- we're interested in is the minimum tax levels that are in the bill. How might that impact both through your cash flow, customer bill impacts, credit statistics, things like that, to the extent that the utility sector doesn't get exempted from that particular provision? What's your sort of latest thinking around the impacts there? Lynn Good : Stephen, because we are 95% regulated, we see the minimum tax as more of a timing issue for us. There could be some cash flow impact, but we would need to look at that within the complexion of all of the elements, the tax incentives and other things. So we do not see a significant bill impact to customers as a result of the way the minimum tax is talked about right now. But as you know, this is a dynamic time and we will have to see how it ultimately progresses. Steve, would you add anything to that? Steve Young : I would agree with that. We would view it as a timing issue. And then there's other provisions. They are extension of other credits, direct pay of credits, and inclusion of nuclear PTCs that -- particularly for Duke with our nuclear fleet. That help mitigate any impacts of this to customers. Stephen Byrd : That's a good point. There are other provisions that sort of pushing the other direction and provide a benefit. Understood. That's all I had. Thank you. Lynn Good : Great. Thanks, Steven. Steve Young : Great. Operator : Next we'll hear from Jonathan Arnold of Vertical Research. Lynn Good : Hey, Jonathan. Jonathan Arnold : Good morning, guys. Lynn Good : Morning. Jonathan Arnold : Hey. I just wanted to pick up on -- you just mentioned the nuclear PTC. Steve, I was curious whether you guys have any sense of yet how you would derive -- define the revenues that would sort of interact with the PTC calculation for you on regulated nukes. Lynn Good : Jonathan, I'll take that. This is a pretty dynamic area and we're yet this morning coming through what came out of the house last night, a couple of thousand pages. We do believe it will apply to regulated nuclear. We do believe that it'll apply for a 6-year period but we're anxious to learn more and study this a bit more. So at this stage of the game, we're talking more about -- we believe regulating nuclear is included, but more to come on how all of these elements fit together. Jonathan Arnold : And just staying with that, with nuclear. One element of HB 951, [Indiscernible] interesting was that you could have a little extra time, if you're pursuing a small modular or I guess nuclear project, or offshore wind. Could you just maybe talk a little bit about how some solutions will be part of what you put forth, and what the time frame might be best guess at the moment on both? Lynn Good : Sure. And you know, Jonathan, if you think back to the scenarios that we put forward in the 2020 IRP, there were a couple of scenarios that got to that 70% level. One included offshore wind, the other included advanced nuclear small modular reactor. We do see a need over time to put in some of these next-generation, although offshore wind very mature in Europe, not as much here in the U.S., but these clean energy technologies. And so I believe this will be an important discussion as the carbon reduction plan is developed, and we will go into that engaging with our regulators, policymakers, communities, to come up with a thoughtful approach on how to incorporate these technologies. And so I think more to come on that as this carbon reduction plan begins to take shape in '22. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. That's good enough. Thank you very much. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : And next we'll hear from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Steve Young : Good morning. Lynn Good : Hi Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey. So Okay. So perhaps just to come back to the 70% piece, obviously, well done on getting the legislation done, I'm curious if you can be more -- Lynn Good : Thank you. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: -- specific about -- indeed, absolutely. I know it's been a long ride so we're finally here. To that point though, when you're thinking about the top half here of the 65 and 75, what are the specific moving pieces that you're thinking about that gets you there? What are the debate points around the 70%? I know you touched earlier about balancing bill headroom against perhaps various other considerations, but if we can talk more changeably about different scenarios or different combinations, if you will, I'm just trying to understand how you get to that upper end, if you will, in terms of the incremental requirement. Lynn Good : Julien, I think the best thing I could point you to at this point is back to the IRPs. And if you look at the volume of solar and storage, the level of coal retirements, the additional resources that will be added to maintain reliability. As you move towards 70% carbon reduction, there are megawatts. And so that's what we are looking at. And this will be important as we go through the carbon reduction planning process commission, of course setting that procedural schedule. There will be a lot of opportunities for discussion, stakeholder in South Carolina at the table. But I would point you back to those IRP because I think that's probably the best place to really begin thinking about the magnitude of the transition. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah. And if I understand those IRP scenarios. Again, I know these things are influx. The 2 specific scenarios that got you there. 1. Included our pathway for offshore and the other one included SMRs. Is it fair right now to think that your bias in favor of offshore, given what we're seeing already across the space or is SMR really kind of one of the key pathways that you're thinking about? Lynn Good : I would say it's too early to tell. We will not unilaterally make a decision. Julien on what technology makes sense for our customers in the states in which we operate. So we believe continued discussion engagement with the regulators, policymakers, communities will be important to this decision. We are evaluating offshore wind. I think you may have noticed there was a proposed sale notice issued for a lease off the coast of North Carolina. The Kitty Hawk lease area is also there. So I would just say it's -- there's more to come here. And as this carbon reduction plan begins to take shape, we'll have an opportunity to further these stakeholder discussions to develop the plan that makes sense for our customers in the states in which we operate. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Yeah. I hear what you're saying. And nothing more specific yet on a definitive timeline on IRP for Indiana in terms of exit from coal, etc. I know that some of your peers have already kind of made broad statements on that front, but that -- we got to wait here, so. Lynn Good : Well, and Julien, I would say it's about 3 weeks away, so the filing is November 30th and as you know, we have been working on reducing the useful life of coal. We did so in connection with the rate cases that were finalized last year. And we will continue to work on coal retirements, diversification, adding renewables, so you can expect to see more at the end of this month on Indiana. And we're actively engaged in the Stakeholder process there, as this work continues. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: All right, well, best of luck with those finals weeks. And we'll see you soon. Lynn Good : Thanks so much. Steve Young : Cheers Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : And next we'll hear from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Ryan: Hi, good morning -- Lynn Good : Hi, Jeremy. Ryan: -- well, actually it's Ryan. On for Jeremy. Sorry. Lynn Good : Okay. Alright. Ryan: Just wondering, you hit on the SEEM proposal that was approved at FERC, we wanted you to give a bit more color on opportunities that come out of that in terms of your renewable's distribution [Indiscernible] transmission of opportunities. Lynn Good : You know, Ryan, I would think about the same as a very customer-focused initiative. And we've had a lot of work done with outside parties to look at the potential and we believe annually customers would save in the range of 40 to 50 million in the near term and up to a 100 and 150 million over the longer term. So we see it as a way that provides greater visibility around the operation of the Southeastern grid and gives us the opportunity to integrate more renewables. So that's how I would think about it here in the near term. And we think it represents a great opportunity to continue to mature the renewable investment here in the Southeast. Ryan: Understood. And then, I'll just ask one on thinking, understand where you get the kind of the full, kind of drivers in 2022 on the year-end call. But the some of the strong load trends you've seen this year and then also, you're kind of a slog ability to take out of the business. How you kind of make at this stage on some of those different drivers into 2022 as you kind of mentioned it being maybe a bridge year, into kind of the capital ramp for 2023 and beyond? Lynn Good : Well, Ryan, I would say we will be within our 5% to 7% growth rate every year, over the 5-year period. Steve shared with you in his remarks what we see those drivers being. So the Florida multiyear rate plan, we\u2019ve got of course, load growth and I'm just referencing that [Indiscernible] a number of other areas. So we'll give you more specifics on what it means in February but I feel like we've got a very solid plan for 2022. Steve Young : I would add, we certainly are seeing solid growth across our jurisdictions. That's always been part of our growth plan. And it is improved through COVID and we will continue to, we believe certainly. We've got a lot of good rate activity coming along as well when you look at our Midwest jurisdictions, Florida as well. We'll see strength there as we finish out the sober program and kick in the new 3-year plan coupled with the organic growth in Florida. So, there's a number of factors with a lot more details, but across our footprint, we've got a number of capabilities that we can pull and cost control is one of them as it has been in the past. Lynn Good : In a rate case activity, Ryan, I was just looking at this slide, Ohio Electric Distribution, Piedmont, North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, so here is a rate case activity also, I would point to. Ryan: Got it. Makes sense. I appreciate the color. Thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : And next, we'll hear from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman : Hi, good morning, Lynn. Lynn Good : Hi, Steve. How are you? Steve Fleishman : Great. Thank you. Hope you're well. So, I have to ask since no one else did, the -- there was a Press report or week or two ago about there being maybe being a settlement soon with Elliott investments. Could you comment on that? And if there's any status of that situation. Lynn Good : And Steve, I'm not going to comment on the press report, but what I will say is we remain in very constructive conversations with Elliott. We are open to a constructive settlement and as I've said many times, our decision process around this will center on terms that we believe are in the best interest of our shareholders and our Company. But constructive conversations continue. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Great. And just in North Carolina, the -- in terms of actually filing another rate case to recover investment, I guess the next one would be under this law, with maybe performance base, when would that be? And is there any time lag issues before you are able to kind of get to that? Lynn Good : Steve, we are evaluating when the appropriate time is for a rate case, as we always do, you point to something that is certainly a consideration. Its rule making process will continue into 2022 and evaluating the timing for a rate case that not only would contemplate that rule making, but also reflect capital investment is work that's underway. And as we have a better sense of that, we will update you. But some work to do, I guess around this rulemaking that I referenced before, we would file under that plan. Steve Fleishman : Okay. So is it not clear right now whether the next rate case would be with the new performance-based or maybe you do a case first without that? Lynn Good : That's an interesting question and depending on the timing of the rule-making, I think it would be good to try to reflect that in the rate filing. Right now, the commission is on target for rule making for PBR by February. That's an aggressive time frame. I know there's a lot of work to do, but to pick up PBR within the rate case would certainly be an objective if the timing works out. Steve Fleishman : Got it. Great. Thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you. We've lost our Operator. April, are you there? you there? Operator : I'm sorry. Our final question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey guys, Lynn Good : Thank you for [Indiscernible] Hi Michael. Michael Lapides : Hi Lynn, and thank you for taking my question. Hey, just curious, when I think about HB 951, the language was pretty clear about on the core retirement securitization being for just the sub-critical units. How should we think about what happens to the supercritical units? The larger kind of bigger component of the Duke Carolinas and Duke Progress fleet over time and whether how you would deal if there were early retirements of those units? Lynn Good : I would think about traditional rate-making on those, Michael. And some of the units will have dual-fuel capability, so they will continue running on natural gas for a period of time. So I would think about that way. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then one follow-on related to 951. I'm just curious, I don't think the offshore wind components made it into the bill. You've talked a little bit about offshore wind than SMRs. How do you -- is the concern, the reason it got left out of the bill more of [Indiscernible] -cost, or were there other concerns that were driving that? Lynn Good : I wouldn't regard it as being left out of the bill but I would regard it as those decisions around clean technologies will be part of the carbon reduction plan and overseen by the Commission, where they will also be evaluating affordability and reliability. So I think more to come on it, Michael, and what technologies will be necessary to hit these goals, and what works for the states, which technologies make the most sense for our policymakers and communities. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you and much appreciated [Indiscernible] Lynn Good : All right, Michael. Thanks. Thank you. Operator : And as Lynn Good : [Indiscernible] Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Lynn Good : All right. April, I'll take it from here. I want to thank everyone for participating today. I know we have a chance to see many if there all of you next week at EEI.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jack Sullivan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Jack Sullivan : Thank you, Samira. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's fourth quarter 2021 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information within the meaning of securities laws. Actual results may be different than forward-looking statements, and those factors are outlined herein and disclosed in Duke Energy's SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found in today's materials and on dukeenergy.com. Please note the appendix for today's presentation includes supplemental information and additional disclosures. So with that, let's turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Jack, thank you, and good morning, everyone. During our call this morning, we're pleased to share our 2021 results and our outlook for 2022 and beyond, including progress on our clean energy transition. The fourth quarter capped off a strong finish to a very productive 2021 where we made great progress against our strategic and financial goals. As a result, today, we announced 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $5.24, putting us above the midpoint of our updated guidance range. We also announced our 2022 guidance range of $5.30 to $5.60 with a midpoint of $5.45, extending our 5% to 7% earnings growth rate through 2026, off the midpoint of our original 2021 guidance range. Our Clean Energy strategy requires significant investment, and we're now budgeting $63 billion in CapEx over the next 5 years, 80% of which represents investments toward our clean energy transition. This growing investment base in constructive and thriving jurisdictions give us confidence in our ability to earn within our 5% to 7% earnings guidance range throughout the next 5 years and in the top half of the range as our plan progresses. Steve will go into more details on our 2021 results and our updated 5-year financial plan. But before I turn the call over to him, I'd like to highlight some of the important strategic work underway. 2021 was a transformative year for our company. And in each of our 3 regions, we made meaningful progress, and we enter 2022 on strong footing. In North Carolina, leaders came together to pass House Bill 951. This landmark bipartisan legislation defines the state's clean energy transition and work is underway to implement it. The North Carolina Utilities Commission is developing rules on the performance-based rate-making provisions in the legislation. We're confident the commission will adopt a balanced set of rules that provide flexibility to implement performance-based rates in a way that achieves policy goals and aligns with customer interest. We expect an order later this week. The North Carolina Commission is also developing rules related to the securitization of 50% of subcritical coal plants upon their early retirements. We proposed a set of rules consistent with the North Carolina storm securitization bonds we issued last fall. Those bonds will save customers approximately 35% or $300 million over the next 20 years. We expect an order on securitization by mid-April. We plan to file our carbon plan in May after gathering stakeholder input over the next several months. HB 951 provides a framework to reach 70% carbon reduction by 2030 and the carbon plan will be a roadmap to achieve this objective. The plan we submit will have multiple portfolios, the way the costs and benefits, including reliability and affordability of various resource types. We will also evaluate with stakeholders and our regulators the full range of potential risks and opportunities related to new clean energy technologies. We expect an order on the carbon plan by the end of this year. In Indiana, we submitted an IRP in December after extensive stakeholder engagement. As the largest generator in the state of Indiana, we are retiring more coal and adding more renewables than any other Indiana utility. Our preferred scenario reduces carbon emissions from our Indiana fleet by 63% by 2030 and 88% by 2040 compared to 2005 levels. It adds over 7 gigawatts of renewables over the 20-year horizon and accelerates the retirement of coal generation with a targeted exit from coal by 2035.  This plan also includes natural gas and a prudent amount of market purchases for capacity and energy requirements. As is the case in all jurisdictions, we expect a robust review of all planned resource additions to achieve the environmental, reliability and affordability goals of the state. We will issue a request for proposal for new generation later this month. And following the RFP process, we will file CPCNs with the Indiana Commission later this year. In Florida, we received approval of the $1 billion Clean Energy Connection solar program, which calls for 750 megawatts over the next 3 years. We'll begin the first year of that program in 2022, along with completing the final solar projects under the sulfur liner. To date, we've put approximately 600 megawatts of solar generation in service in Florida with another 150 megawatts currently under construction. Let me close by putting our progress and our plans for the future in the context of our climate strategy. Given the scale of our company, we're leading the industry's most ambitious clean energy transformation. This demands active engagement with regulators, policymakers, customers and stakeholders to make the vision a reality. It requires candid discussions about the appropriate energy policy for each state, recognizing the unique differences of existing resources, customer bases and policy objectives. It also requires a focus on keeping customer bills affordable, a critical variable as we pursue this transformation. We continue to make progress and are strongly positioned to achieve our Clean Energy vision. Slide 6 captures our progress and the work underway. Let me share a few important highlights. We're executing the largest planned coal fleet retirement in our industry, targeting energy from coal to represent less than 5% by 2030 and a full exit by 2035. Embedded within Duke Energy is the top 10 U.S. renewable energy company, we now own, operate or purchase more than 10,000 megawatts of solar and wind energy. We plan to reach 16,000 megawatts by 2025 and 24,000 megawatts by 2030. We've reduced our carbon emissions by 44% from 2005 levels, and we're on track to exceed 50% by 2030 and net 0 by 2050. We're actively engaged with policymakers and advocating for and piloting new clean energy technologies necessary to meet our net 0 goal. We're also stepping back and evaluating our climate goals more broadly as we engage with our shareholders and discuss the growing importance of Scope 2 and 3 emissions. And just yesterday, we announced we're expanding our net 0 goals to now include Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 emissions, such as upstream emissions related to procurement of fossil resources and downstream emissions for our natural gas customers' consumption. These initiatives will be a key focus area for our management team and across the entire company in 2022 and beyond. We look forward to sharing more details about what it will take and the ways we're building upon our success to advance our long-term business strategy at our next ESG Day planned for October 4. I encourage you to join us for this interactive live streamed event.  We accomplished a great deal in 2021. We delivered on our commitments while also strategically positioning the company for the future, derisking investments, simplifying our business and modernizing our regulatory frameworks. We have a clear vision to meet the needs of our customers and communities while remaining a strong steward of the environment. We believe this strategy will deliver strong, consistent and enduring benefits to our customers, communities and investors. And with that, let me turn the call over to Steve. Steve Young : Thanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. 2021 marked a year of strong growth in our core businesses. As shown on Slide 7, our full year adjusted earnings per share was $5.24, above the midpoint of our revised guidance range. In the electric segment, we benefited from 2% volume growth, the full year impact of constructive rate case outcomes in North Carolina and Indiana, increases in Florida from their previous multiyear rate plan and solar installations and continued rider investment in the Midwest. Additionally, we met our goal of delivering $200 million in sustainable cost savings in 2021. In our gas LDC business, we saw higher results from Piedmont rate cases in North Carolina and Tennessee and contributions from customer growth and rider mechanisms. Results from commercial were lower due to fewer growth investments compared to 2020 and the impact of Winter Storm Uri in February 2021. Turning to Slide 8, we are introducing our $5.30 to $5.60 guidance range in 2022. For Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, we expect growth due to expansion in our robust service areas and earnings on infrastructure investments. Specifically, in Florida, we began the first year of our new multiyear rate plan, coupled with the benefits of strong customer growth. In the Carolinas, we will see earnings growth from new customers, grid investments and wholesale revenues. In the Midwest, we continue to benefit from the steady investment in T&D Infrastructure. Our Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment is expected to benefit in 2022 from customer additions and integrity management investments as well as base rate increases following settlements approved in North Carolina and Kentucky. In Commercial Renewables, we expect fewer projects in 2022 as we ramp up deployment of renewable assets in Florida and the Carolinas, and provide breathing room to work through supply chain challenges. As such, the timing of some commercial renewables projects will shift within the 5-year plan. Finally, we expect the other segment to be unfavorable, primarily due to higher interest expense as we grow our energy investment base. Turning to Slide 9. Let me touch on electric volumes and economic trends. Consistent with our updated guidance on our Q3 earnings call, we achieved 2% growth for total retail volumes. This includes residential load growth of 0.7%, helped by the continuation of remote work and strong customer growth of 1.6%. In fact, 3 of the states we serve were among the top 5 states for net population migration in 2021, strong evidence of our attractive growth profile.  Since the pandemic began, approximately 200,000 new customers have moved into our service areas, boosting the need for energy infrastructure. Commercial and industrial sales rebounded nicely due to increased demand for goods across many sectors. We expect continued expansion in 2022 and project load growth to increase approximately 1.5% in 2022. After '22, we expect longer-term growth to moderate to flat to 0.5% per year. As I mentioned before, we delivered on our O&M target for 2021. On Slide 10, you will see the work we've undertaken to lower our cost structure and bolster our potential growth. Duke Energy is a leader in the industry when it comes to cost mitigation, driven by digital capabilities, data analytics and reskilling our workforce. Since 2016, we have not just absorbed inflation, we have removed approximately $400 million of O&M, creating value for our customers and our shareholders. For every dollar of O&M we eliminate, we can invest about $7 of capital without increasing cost to customers. Our $400 million in savings over the past 5 years has created headroom for approximately $3 billion worth of capital projects with no incremental bill impacts. Looking forward, we expect to hold O&M flat throughout our plan. We believe there are significant opportunities across the enterprise to further improve efficiencies, which could lower the O&M trajectory as we advance our fleet transition strategy, replacing coal assets with less than -- O&M intensive forms of generation is a perfect example of this and the investments we are making are designed to lower our cost structure while maintaining high standards of safety and reliability. Our size and scale remain key differentiators as we work to mitigate supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures across our cost structure. Turning to Slide 11, we expect to deploy over $130 billion over the next decade with $63 billion to occur over the next 5 years. This represents a $4 billion increase over our previous 5-year capital plan and strengthens our rate base growth to 6.5% to 7%. Approximately $52 billion or over 80% of our capital plan throughout 2026 will fund investments in our fleet transition and grid modernization. This will include improved reliability and resiliencies, we'll add more renewables to the system and extend the life of our carbon-free nuclear fleet to better serve our growing customer base. As coal is phased out from our generation profile, it will be replaced with 0 carbon resources and prudent investments in cleaner natural gas. We formed strategic partnerships to size the long-term potential of hydrogen coal firing storage including a pilot program we launched this year, where we believe our natural gas units are well positioned to take advantage of hydrogen technology as it evolves. Turning to Slide 12. Our sizable capital plan, high-growth service territories, proven capability to control costs and constructive regulatory frameworks give us confidence in our ability to consistently grow earnings at 5% to 7%, and potential to earn at the top half of the range in the back half of the plan. Moving to Slide 13. Our ability to execute our robust capital program is underpinned by a healthy balance sheet and we remain committed to our current credit ratings. In September 2021, we received $1 billion in cash proceeds upon closing the first tranche of our minority interest sale of our Indiana utility. The second closing will occur by January 2023 and will result in another cash infusion of $1 billion. This combined $2 billion of proceeds provide good support to our credit metrics. We closed out 2021 in line with our 14% FFO-to-debt target, and we expect to maintain 14% in 2022 and beyond. Our financing needs are driven by our investments. And we have constructed a plan that achieves 5% to 7% earnings growth through 2026, while maintaining our current credit profile. Our current plan does not contemplate any additional common equity through 2026, but we will monitor a variety of things that may influence future needs, including the pace and size of our capital deployment, future regulatory outcomes and the potential for support of tax policy. To the extent it becomes a need for additional equity, we will evaluate all options and pursue the ones that finance our growth in the most efficient manner and support our earnings growth trajectory. Before we open it up for questions, let me close with Slide 14. Our focus on the future, sound investment strategy and demonstrated dexterity offer a strong long-term growth proposition. Our commitment to the dividend remains unchanged. We understand how important it is to our shareholders, and that's why 2022 will mark the 96th consecutive year of paying a quarterly cash dividend. We intend to keep growing the dividend, balancing our desire to offer investors a strong 65% to 75% payout ratio with our need to fund our capital plan. 2021 was exceptionally productive and we have a strong momentum as we begin 2022. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.  With that, we'll open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Jamieson Ward : It's Jamieson Ward on for Shar. Lynn, at a high level, we were wondering how should we think about the carbon plan that you'll be filing in May versus what will become the final version in the order required by December 31? Who's going to be weighing in on it or contributing to it? And as a follow-up, how will it differ from, say, a traditional IRP? Lynn Good : Well, James, and thank you for that question, and the work is already underway to develop the plan. We had our first stakeholder meeting just a week-or-so ago and there are additional meetings planned. And I would share with you that it will be a review of the full range of existing and potential resources to achieve the objective. We envision putting forward multiple scenarios as we did in the 2020 IRP so that we have a good discussion of weighing cost and benefits of the various resource types. And it's also going to have good discussions about reliability and affordability, coupled with environmental achievement.  So I would expect it to be somewhat similar in concept to what we produced in 2020, James, because it will be a variety of portfolios but is always well informed by our stakeholders and directed toward achieving what the legislature has set out for us, which is 70% carbon by -- reduction by 2030. Jamieson Ward : Got it. Got it. And second question we had here was under the items to monitor on Slide 12, you mentioned supply chain constraints. At EEI back in November, the takeaway that people seem to have for meetings with both Duke and echoed by other large utilities was that you weren't really seeing much impact at that time from supply chain constraints. What's changed since EEI? And just another follow-up on that, how much of these supply chain constraints are specifically related to renewables? And then for the nonrenewable portion, what does that consist of? Lynn Good : Yes. It's a good question because it's a dynamic area. And I would say generally that the scope and scale of our company has positioned us really well on supply chain considerations. We've done a very good job of expanding our horizon to look at demand, leveraging long-term contracts, leveraging what we maintain in inventory. So we have not seen an impact on the majority, if -- significantly of the capital plans that we have in place.  But we have experienced some impact from solar panels, and you'll see us. We talked a little bit about this in the third quarter call, evaluating what it might mean, we're pushing some projects in commercial renewables in particular, to 2023, we've been able to achieve all of our dates of regulated renewables, however. So I would leave you with the fact that it's a dynamic area. There are areas where lead times are increasing, but we feel well positioned given the scale of the company and the approach that we're taking to manage what our customers require. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: So maybe, if I can, maybe the first question is perhaps 2 parts. First, \u201922 guidance, you have a lot of interesting tailwinds here. O&M load growth accelerating, obviously, disappointing on the renewables, but that seems to be pervasive. Can you talk about maybe latitude within this guidance range, certainly considering that accelerating growth really is a meaningful driver? And then secondly, just related to that, and I suspect this is perhaps part of the reason for the guidance range. Can you talk about your confidence on the ability to cut $100 million in cost with the backdrop of inflation admittedly elsewhere in the sector? Lynn Good : Yes. So I'll take a shot, and I'm sure Steve will have something to add. Julien, I believe what we put forward through 2022 is a very strong growth story. It's built on Florida, the Carolinas, Midwest gas rate cases, load growth, O&M cost management, all the things that you referenced. I also believe that the increase in capital that we've put forward should give you confidence that we're going to keep going and have the investment portfolio to drive 5% to 7%. In 2022, though, I also think it's important to recognize we have some foundational work underway in the Carolinas legislation, it was a hallmark in 2021, but we're in the regulatory process in 2022. We're waiting for guidance on the performance-based rate making. We're waiting for guidance on securitization. We have a carbon plan to file. And so that will be additional important work in 2022 that will set us up for the future. In terms of inflation, we are seeing labor inflation as the one thing I would point to. And if you look at our trajectory, we're recommending flat. We will go at it as hard as we can, but we will also make sure we have the talent and capability from our line workers to our software engineers to do what this business requires and our customers' demand. So I feel like we've taken all of these variables together, and not only put together a strong plan for 2022, but also a strong plan for '23 and beyond. Steve, how would you add? Steve Young : I might add a couple of things. On the cost side, we took $200 million out sustainable as we had promised, and we've delivered on that. We've got 2,000 less employees at Duke Energy than we did a year ago. We retired 5 coal units, and that takes out some O&M there. But we're going to keep moving forward. Our scope and scale allows us to do this. We've completely redone our real estate footprint and taking advantage of COVID immediately on the real estate savings.  We're going to continue to drive out efficiencies and utilize technology to displace the need for other costs. And we've had success for the past 5 years of doing that of driving O&M down. We put flat O&M into our trajectory in response to what is inflation there. But we're going to continue to hammer our way at it. And we've got the tools to do that. We'll see where that goes, but out of respect for the trends we see on cost, we flattened it out, we're going to be driving hard at it, Julien. Lynn Good : And I think when you step back and look at guidance, maybe just 1 comment on guidance, too, and we feel like it's a very strong growth story. You may remember that we reset the 5% to 7% for the first time off of 5.15. We believe this is a very strong start. And as you know, we'll be working hard not only to hit these numbers. But if circumstances are such we can exceed them, we'll do that. But we believe this is a compelling growth story. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: I hear you loud and clear on that last comment. And in fact, if I can ask you this little bit in reverse. I mean, clearly, you're hitting these '22 numbers considering commercial renewals being a little lower and some of that being delayed, does that actually conversely mean that '23 and '24 could actually be sort of a bumper crop year with respect to some of the renewable contributions, especially relative to historic $200 million to $250 million guidance? Lynn Good : Julien, we are evaluating capital allocation on renewables and Steve's comments, you might have noticed, we said as we ramp up partner investment in the Carolinas and in Florida around renewables. So we will make the right decision on where we invest the renewable capital. I think the planning assumption of $200 million to $250 million is still reasonable for commercial, but know that we're also going to be adding a lot of renewables in those regulated businesses. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Stephen Byrd : I was interested in your latest thinking in terms of some form of federal Clean Energy legislation. I know there's been a lot of dialogue, you all have been very involved in dialogue there. So just curious your latest take on the prospects for passage at the federal level. Lynn Good : Stephen, it's hard to handicap because we don't have a vehicle yet. There are a variety of other topics being discussed within that construct of what the administration would like to move. But it is our conviction that the clean energy tax provisions would be very helpful not only to support the transformation that's underway at Duke, but throughout the industry, and also allow us to lower the price of that transformation.  For a regulated company, those tax incentives have a direct impact on our price to customers. So we are strong advocates for it. We actually believe that nuclear is a great recognition of that resource, some of the modernization around solar to introduce PTCs, the opportunity to have direct pay. All of these things, we believe, could be helpful in this transformation that we're pursuing so aggressively. Stephen Byrd : That's helpful. And then I just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions on renewable supply chain. I wanted to drill in on solar a little bit more. I wondered if you could provide anything specific in terms of just the rough magnitude of cost increases you're seeing? And also, if you could speak to just the physical availability of panels in '22 and the outlook there, just curious for a little more color there. Lynn Good : And Stephen, I would point to availability as the first and most gating item because of some of the restrictions around trade and other things, there has been an issue around availability and certain suppliers have said we can't meet the time frame. And as a result of that, you then begin looking for alternatives, and those alternatives can be more expensive. So we have made a decision to push some of our projects into '23. We're very confident in our projects that we have identified for '23, but we have appropriate supply and are ready to go. But that's what I would share with you. The gating issue has been availability. And then as you pursue alternatives, price can become an issue. Stephen Byrd : That's helpful. And maybe just following up on that, and then I'll pass it to someone else. Just on the magnitude of push back of projects in terms of sort of gigawatts, what sort of rough magnitude are you thinking that you want to push into '23? Lynn Good : Stephen, as I look at what we have put forward as guidance, we're at $150 million for the commercial business, we have been targeting $200 million to $250 million. So I would think about a couple of projects that are being pushed from '22 to '23. Steve Young : It might be in the neighborhood of 400, 500 megawatts, something of that nature. And then we'll look at, again, '23 as we approach it to see what makes sense based on the projects that are there and the returns as we move forward. But I still think around the 200 to 250 as the reasonable planning assumption for what we'll do. Lynn Good : And Stephen, a moment ago, I also noted, we were able to complete all of the regulated renewable projects and have secured supply for them for 2022. So we're doing some balancing here and believe that the net result of all of this puts us in a strong position to achieve our objectives. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steve Fleishman : Just -- can you just confirm whether you're still expecting to get the multiyear rate plan proposal out today, the performance-based ratemaking? And just what are the key items that we should be watching in that? Lynn Good : Yes. And we expected this week. I guess we're sitting here on Thursday. Steve, it could come out today. I think the 10th was the plan, but we are expecting it. And we'll get something out from Investor Relations when that rulemaking appears. Steve Fleishman : Okay. So we\u2019ll just see what it has to say. Lynn Good : Yes. And we're in the second constructive rulemaking. Steve Fleishman : Great. And then in terms of when you kind of referenced both, in the upside drivers for the long-term plan and I think Steve's comments on things that could lead you to look at equity needs, the tax policy. Could you just kind of give a little more sense on what you're referring to there? Is it that if we get favorable renewable tax policy, you might invest a lot more capital, and thus, with that also have some equity needs? Or is it something beyond that? Lynn Good : Steve, it's actually a reverse of that because if we get constructive tax policy, think about direct pay, think about nuclear PTC, that is very favorable from a cash flow standpoint. And that gives us an opportunity to consider potentially additional capital. But you should think about that as an infusion of cash into the plan in a way that could be quite helpful. Steve Fleishman : Makes sense. So then when you talk about tax policy as something that may have equity, is that more of the corporate tax changes? Lynn Good : Yes. There's -- the linkage of tax policy and equity needs is not what as you're thinking about it, Steve. We included that to say that could be a reason to reduce the need for equity even beyond '26 depending on what's happening. So there are positives and negatives in that. Steve Young : Yes. We were looking at cash flow changes as well as capital changes and the tax policy is very beneficial from a tax -- Steve Fleishman : Okay. I thought those were things that would only create equity, and it's not the one that was on. That's why I didn't make sense to me. Lynn Good : I'm glad we had a chance to clear that up. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research. Jonathan Arnold : Last quarter, you were talking about 2% to 2.5% sales growth for the full year. And it felt like you were sounding more confident towards the upper end perhaps and came in at 2%. And then looking at the release, if I'm reading it correctly, you actually had well, the normal sales go down in the fourth quarter and industrial tick off about 5%. So just can you give us a little color on what was behind that? I wasn't necessarily expecting to see a down fourth quarter in industrial, at least quite yet. Steve Young : Well, I think when you're looking at AVA for the quarter, the fourth quarter of the previous year was starting to pick up quite a bit, so there's some comparative things there. I think as we move forward, what we're really projecting here is that we're going to catch up by the end of '22 to where we would have been prior to COVID hitting when you just take 2019 and extrapolate out. So I wouldn't look at any 1 particular quarter comparison to another quarter as you could have shutdowns in certain industries and that nature that might impact the stats. But looking broadly across it, what we see is return by the end of '22 to where we were at prior to COVID and then we've got pretty flattish load growth assumed from that point forward. We feel good about '22 growth across the board. We've added a lot of customers, as we alluded to. And customers moving into the area, that will drive commercial, education, health care, retail, that picks up. And then when we look across our industrial base and talk to our industrial customers, we've got such a diverse body of industrial customers. No one customer SIC code is greater than 10%. We see them optimistic about further growth in '22. So I'd think about that a bit more than just a quarter versus quarter examination. Jonathan Arnold : Management stuff, can you talk a little bit about how the pathway to sort of integrating North and South Carolina around the carbon plan, given some of the recent developments in the South? And I guess you were trying to pull -- have a joint proceeding, but that looks like it may not happen now. So just what -- how do we bring this forward on a fuel track? Lynn Good : Sure. And Jonathan, North and South Carolina have found a way over decades to work together and have developed a joint electric system that delivers affordable and reliable power, but they've also benefited from infrastructure investment in both states. 6 nuclear power plants, 3 in North Carolina, 3 in South Carolina. So we are optimistic that we'll be able to develop resource plans that meet the needs of both states. They are, of course, different, but both are interested in clean energy, clean energy transition, renewables, et cetera. The joint hearing that we suggested and worked toward was an innovative idea. We thought it would be an opportunity for the states to engage, but it's not the only way. And as we think about the future and the number of proceedings that will unfold over the next several years with resource additions and potential retirements, there will be plenty of opportunity for the states to work together in a way that makes sense for their policies. We'd also expect South Carolina to be at the table in the stakeholder meetings over the course of 2022. I know they are not only interested in what it means for customers around affordability and resiliency, but also what it means in terms of investment. And I think there is a lot here for both states, and we're anxious to work towards something that makes sense for everyone. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. What would be the next data point in South Carolina, what's the path there? Lynn Good : Jonathan, I would -- I'm not going to point to a specific milestone, but rather say that we will update you on the stakeholder engagements. We'll update you on the carbon plan as that gets finalized. To the extent there are filings that we might make in South Carolina, we'll, of course, give updates on that. So you can expect this to unfold not only over the course of '22, but into '23 as well. And South Carolina will be at the table every step of the way. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI India. Durgesh Chopra : Just can I clarify in terms of O&M savings target for 2022? I heard you say the $200 million savings in 2021. What is embedded in the 2022 guidance? Is it flat O&M '22 to 2021? Or are we modeling decreases further from the 2021 levels? Steve Young : We've assumed flat O&M in '22 compared to 2021. The $200 million was taken out in '21 and is sustainable, so it will be in there. But we're assuming it's flat in '22 and throughout our plan. But what I would point to is we have a strong track record of finding O&M savings across our footprint, and none of that has stopped. And we've got inflationary issues that everybody's heard about. So we flattened it out, but we're certainly continuing to drive to find the opportunities to utilize capital technology to take out variable O&M, and that goes on every day. Durgesh Chopra : Got it. And then just in terms of your comment, the potentially higher growth rate in the back half of the plan, the upper half of the 5% to 7%, is that driven by basically you getting regulatory approvals, perhaps even stronger-than-expected customer load? What gives you -- sort of what would drive that higher growth rate in the upper half in the back half of the plan? Lynn Good : I would think about the work that's underway in 2022, Durgesh, around the Carolinas. So we have -- legislation has been passed, but we have regulatory proceedings underway to set the course on the performance-based rate making and on the plan. That, of course, will begin to be executed in '23 and '24. So there's going to be a sort of back half approach around the capital and the regulatory modernization in the Carolinas. And then further in Indiana, the IRP was filed in December. We're anticipating RFPs and potentially CPCNs to be filed in 2022 that will begin the execution of the next phase of the transition in Indiana as well. So those are a couple of things that I would point to that are important as you think about the end of this 5-year plan, but the remaining years in this decade. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : I just wanted to touch on financing a bit more, if I could here. And just wondering, if you could provide a bit more color on the 2022 hybrid security funding. What kind of -- what could that look like? What type of size could that part be? And then separately, looking forward, we've talked about the robust capital opportunities that you've highlighted throughout the call. How should we think about equity needs over the course of the 5-year plan and beyond? And I know you talked in the script about alternatives and just looking for a little bit more color what the alternatives could be, could this be other DI type transactions? Or maybe monetizing commercial renewables? Just trying to see what possibilities are out there. Steve Young : A couple of things there. When we look at our financing plan, I don't have any specifics on what a hybrid security might look like, but we always consider those -- there are times where those can certainly make sense when the value they can bring and the price makes sense to us, so we'll always allude to that as a possibility there, but nothing specific on that front. When you think about the 5-year plan, we put together a plan here that we do not believe we need any incremental equity beyond the $1 billion of the second tranche of the GIC deal that will be coming in within the next 12 months. We think we've got regulatory constructs in place across our jurisdiction that are very efficient, and we have regulatory plans to make those investments through those regulatory constructs. We've also got a great ability to control cost. We've shown that, and that helps the bottom line metrics as well.  So no equity financing plans through the plan. Now as we move through the decade, for the circumstances that Lynn had described, we could see needs coming at us. We'll utilize the most efficient form of raising equity and we've shown great ability to do that through traditional methods, through non-traditional, through monetization of businesses. We'll look at all of that. We're well aware of our portfolio's value. It's good to have that optionality. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful there. And then kind of pivoting here. You talked about carbon capture, hydrogen nuclear. Just wondering how far are these technologies from being widely adopted in your view here? And are these items that can drive upside to the 10-year outlook? Or are they kind of longer dated? And then specifically with CCUS, just wondering what stakeholder views are like there? And what discussions have been like with the regulators on CCUS in your jurisdictions? Lynn Good : I think this is an important discussion to progress in this decade. And so the awareness around hydrogen, the awareness around advanced nuclear, the awareness around what might be possible in CCUS is something that is a part of our conversations with all of our regulators. And you begin to see even offshore wind part of the conversation with regulators. It's a mature technology in Europe but relatively new in the U.S. And the good news is we believe we have runway with existing technologies to achieve the majority of our aspirations around clean energy transition over the next 5 years-or-so. And so you're getting into the 2030s when those technologies would be more important to get to net 0 and the next tranche of carbon reduction. And so I think time will tell on whether they get to commercial scale. We begin to see some demonstration projects, like in advanced nuclear in the 2028 time frame. But I would also point to the amount of money that's in the infrastructure bill to really pilot and develop and get these technologies to scale. So it's possible it occurs even more rapidly. But we will be thoughtful working with stakeholders and our regulators before we begin introducing any of these technologies so that we have a common view of what we would like to achieve and invest in to meet our goals. Operator : And our next question comes from James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets. James Thalacker : And I didn't want to really kind of beat a dead horse, but just regarding the acceleration of your growth rate into the upper half of the 5% to 7%, maybe Lynn or Steve, should we think about this in the context of the current 2022 to 2026 plan? Or as you look farther out into the kind of 2030 time frame, given your capital plan shows some significant acceleration in that kind of '27 through '30 time frame? Lynn Good : In the back half of this 5-year plan, Jim, but certainly continuing in the back part of the decade. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'll turn the conference over to Lynn Good, Chair, President and CEO, for any additional remarks. Lynn Good : Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for joining. I know these calls in February are always full of information, not only in what we have achieved, but where we're going. And so we're available to answer any follow-on questions and look forward to talking with many of you in the weeks to come. So thanks again for your interest in Duke Energy. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. Thank you for attending today's Duke Energy Quarter 1, 2022 Conference Call. My name is Amber, and I will be your moderator for today's call. All lines have been muted during the presentation portion of the call, with an opportunity for questions-and-answers at the end. [Operator Instructions]. I now have the pleasure of handing the conference over to our host, Jack Sullivan, Vice President of Investor Relations with Duke Energy. Mr. Sullivan, please proceed. Jack Sullivan : Thank you, Amber. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to Duke Energy's first quarter 2022 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer; along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and CFO.  Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information within the meaning of securities laws. Actual results may be different than forward-looking statements. And those factors are outlined herein and disclosed in Duke Energy's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information and disclosures, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.  So with that, let's turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Jack, thank you. And good morning, everyone. Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.30 for the quarter, delivering strong results to start the year, driven by continued growth in electric volumes. That growth was partially offset by $0.07 of higher expense from severe winter storms.  I'd like to take a moment to thank approximately 19,000 restoration workers, who worked tirelessly to restore power to over 1 million customers across a series of winter storms, the most we've seen in eight years.  Despite the Q1 storms, we remain on track to deliver within our original guidance range and are reaffirming our full year earnings guidance range of $5.30 to $5.60, with a midpoint of $5.45. We're also reaffirming our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2026, at the midpoint of our original 2021 guidance range. We're monitoring economic trends and will take action if necessary as we continue to execute the important strategic work we have underway in the Carolinas, Indiana and Florida. I will touch on this more in just a moment. Turning to Slide 5. We published our first ESG report in late-April that expands our historic sustainability themes and adds more insight on social and governance topics. We've included some highlights and key accomplishments on this slide.  We've got a strong track record in each of these areas and have established ambitious targets for the future. Our work has been recognized across the ESG community, including by MSCI, which upgraded our ESG rating to AA in February. We're also laying the groundwork for even more progress with our proposed carbon plan in North Carolina, our IRP in Indiana and our ongoing solar and grid investments in Florida. We look forward to sharing additional updates throughout the year and during our ESG Day on October 4. Moving to Slide 6. Let me spend a few minutes on North Carolina. There's a meaningful progress in the state implementing the framework set forth in House Bill 951. As a reminder, this landmark bipartisan legislation provides for a clean energy transition as well as modernize performance-based rate-making provisions, including multiyear rate plans, performance incentive measures and residential decoupling.  We've been working closely with stakeholders on the development of our proposed carbon plan, which we will file with the commission on May 16.  The plan will outline multiple portfolios to achieve the 70% carbon reduction target, including proposals around timing of coal plant retirements and resource additions. We expect substantial solar and battery additions, demand side management and energy efficiency opportunities in every pathway. Onshore and offshore wind will be presented for consideration as well as small modular nuclear reactors. Each portfolio has been rigorously tested for reliability and affordability for our customers. Following the May 16 filing of our proposed carbon plan, the commission will gather additional stakeholder input, make adjustments and approve a final plan by the end of the year. The plan will be updated every two years thereafter.  In February, the North Carolina Utilities Commission issued its order on rulemaking for performance-based regulation. And in April, the Commission issued its order on rule making for coal plant securitization. This allows our North Carolina utilities to securitize half of the remaining carrying value of certain coal plants upon their early retirement. Both orders were constructive, establishing processes that are fair, balanced and consistent with the policy objectives of HB 951. Another strategic priority for 2022 is to file a rate case, introducing the modernized rate-making tools approved in HB 951. The NCUC has established a process for these filings that include technical conferences on the multiyear rate plans prior to filing. We currently expect to file a DEP North Carolina rate case in the fourth quarter and likely a DEC North Carolina rate case early next year. Turning to Slide 7. I'd like to touch on the key initiatives across our service territories. In South Carolina storm cost securitization legislation continues to move forward. The proposed legislation has passed in the Senate and is now being heard in the House. If enacted, this legislation would provide an additional tool to recover prior and future storm restoration costs, creating significant savings for our customers as compared to traditional recovery mechanisms. Moving to Florida, we're making investments to harden the grid under our storm protection plan. We recently filed our updated plan, which includes $7 billion of capital investments over the next 10 years. In Indiana, we filed request for proposals for up to 2,400 megawatts of new generation through 2027, which includes both intermittent and dispatchable resources to support our transition from coal.  We're pleased with the response to our intermittent RFP, having received bids from 13 developers on more than 30 different projects totaling over 7,000 megawatts. On May 2, we received the bids for the dispatchable portion of the RFP and are reviewing them now. We expect to file CPCNs with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission later this year. In November, we filed our second TDSIC plan in Indiana. The six-year, $2 billion plan includes investments to improve customer reliability, harden the grid and prepare for distributed generation. A hearing was held in March, and we expect to receive a decision from the commission in July. If approved, the program would begin in 2023. Shifting to the LDCs, we continue to make investments to build needed infrastructure, improve reliability and to comply with federal regulations. In South Carolina, we filed a general rate case in April. If approved, we anticipate revised customer rates will be effective by October. And in Tennessee, legislation was recently passed that will allow natural gas utilities to invest in low to zero emission capital projects. This legislation will help enable our decarbonization vision for our natural gas business unit and could serve as a blueprint for legislation in other states across the country. In closing, we're making progress on all fronts across our jurisdictions, meeting our commitments and executing our clean energy strategy. We have a clear path forward for 2022, and believe our investment plan will deliver sustainable value to shareholders and 5% to 7% earnings growth over the next five years.  And with that, let me turn the call over to Steve. Steve Young : Thanks, Lynn. And good morning, everyone. I'll start with a brief discussion of our quarterly results, highlighting a few of the key variances to the prior year.  As shown on Slide 8, our first quarter reported earnings per share was $1.08, and our adjusted earnings per share was $1.30. This compared to reported and adjusted earnings per share of $1.25 and $1.26 last year. Please see our non-GAAP reconciliation included in the earnings release for more details. Within the segments, Electric Utilities & Infrastructure was up $0.10 compared to the prior year. Results were favorable due to higher volumes and base rate increases. Partially offsetting these items were higher O&M, primarily attributed to severe winter storms and weaker weather than last year.  In our gas LDC business, we were flat year-over-year, with contributions from rate cases and riders, offset by higher O&M due to timing and costs associated with new investments. Results from Commercial were $0.02 lower due to fewer growth investments compared to 2021, partially offset by favorability from fewer winter storms impacting our commercial fleet. And in the other segment, we were $0.04 lower, primarily due to lower market returns on Benefit Trusts. Turning to Slide 9, let me touch on electric volumes and economic trends. We started off the year with continued load growth, improving our rolling 12-month retail growth rate to 3.8%. This figure has continued to steadily improve over the past four quarters, as we've been replacing weaker orders experienced in the first year of the pandemic, with stronger quarters during the second year. We believe Q1 '22 represents the high watermark for this rolling 12-month figure and expect the growth rate will moderate as we move further into 2022, ultimately landing around 1.5% for the full year. This is consistent with the 2022 load forecast we shared on our fourth quarter earnings call in February. The favorable first quarter results for the electric utilities are mainly driven by sustained residential customer growth of 1.8% and the loosening of COVID restrictions for commercial and industrial customers. We also benefited from residential customers who continue to work from home and from incremental load in the Carolinas and Midwest as customers rode out several winter storms from home.  For commercial and industrial classes, we saw a continued rebound of our existing customers. And looking ahead, we will start to see incremental growth from new customers due to the outstanding accomplishments of our economic development team. In 2021, we helped attract nearly 12,500 new jobs and $6.2 billion in capital investment to our service territories, creating vibrant economies and accelerating growth in our communities. We have seen this momentum continue into 2022. While these results are a great start to the year, we are watching key economic indicators such as moderating GDP growth, rising inflation and supply chain constraints. We will actively -- we will activate agility measures and leverage our size and scale to counteract rising cost and secure necessary materials through vendor relationships, advanced ordering and other measures. This work will continue for all aspects of our business to control O&M costs, to secure the materials and services we need to execute our growth plan. With ongoing constraints impacting the global supply of solar panels, let me take a moment to address this matter. On our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we reduced our 2022 net income projection for the Commercial Renewables segment to approximately $150 million, down from our original range of $200 million to $250 million. This related to a strategic decision to prioritize our regulated solar projects with our existing panel supply. Having taken those steps in February, we are well positioned on all solar projects slated for 2022 across our regulated and commercial operations.  Looking to 2023 and beyond, we're closely monitoring the Department of Commerce investigations. We assess the timing of our solar projects. On the regulated side, we expect no delays in 2023. For commercial renewables business, we are targeting approximately 800 megawatts of solar in 2023 and have line of sight on roughly half at this time. Panels have been secured and PPA negotiations are underway. The remaining solar projects are in various stages of development and largely dependent upon panel price clarity. If delays persist, we may see a few projects shift from 2023 to 2024, resulting in the commercial business delivering more in-line with 2022. We are planning for a range of outcomes and have a pipeline of capital and agility levers to maintain our 5% to 7% annual earnings growth trajectory. As a reminder, our commercial solar capital for 2023 represents approximately 1% of our total CapEx for the five-year plan. Turning to our nuclear operations. Duke Energy owns and operates the largest regulated nuclear fleet in North America. As such, we have a significant inventory of enriched uranium product and have agreements with a diverse set of suppliers across several continents. Regardless of any potential sanctions related to the Russia-Ukraine war, our existing uranium inventories, contracts and supply flexibility are sufficient to fuel our nuclear fleet. Let me close with Slide 11. We are off to a good start in 2022, and feel confident of our earnings guidance range of $5.30 to $5.60, with a midpoint of $5.45.  Let me discuss the earnings profile for the remainder of the year. Compared to 2021 second quarter, we will see higher O&M, simply due to the different slotting of planned outages in a given calendar year. Additionally, the Florida rate settlement timing and wholesale contract recognition will pick up in the second half of 2022. The growth in the natural gas business unit, resulting from rate cases, riders and customer growth, will largely impact the fourth quarter. Turning to Commercial Renewables, the majority of the negative variance compared to 2021 occurs in the first half of the year. Again, we are on target for earnings in 2022, but these factors will impact the quarterly shaping of those earnings. In conclusion, we continue to make meaningful strides in 2022 towards the advancement of our clean energy strategy, with a keen focus on affordability and reliability for our customers. Our attractive dividend yield, coupled with our long-term earnings growth from investments in our regulated utilities and robust service territories, provides a compelling risk-adjusted return for our shareholders.  With that, we'll open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Julien, your line is now open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for the time and opportunity to connect here. Appreciate it and thanks for the details on the call. Lynn Good : Good morning. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Good morning, indeed. Just going back -- if I can go back super quick to the solar CapEx here and the conversation there very quickly. I think the key point was you're in line from '22 to '23, so kind of at that 150-ish level for '23. Again, you said if delays persist. Can you elaborate a little bit more about what that would look like if delays persist? And also, if you can, can you recap for us a little bit on the earnings recognition. Just how should we think about that the weighted sort of average of across your portfolio? How much of that ITC is being captured in that first year, if we think about sort of the mechanics behind that impact, if you will? Lynn Good : Sure. And, Julien, I'll take a shot, and I'm sure Steve will have some things to add. I think the headline that I'd like to leave with you is we are on track in 2022 for both commercial and regulated renewables. So the earnings that we have been talking about, the adjustment that we made to 2022, we are tracking exactly to both of those.  For 2023, we continue to prioritize our regulated renewables and they are on track. As we look at \u201823 for commercial, there is some uncertainty that's been created by this investigation really around price and how that price is going to ultimately impact project economics. So we are planning for a range of outcomes. And what Steve shared with you is that range could include something comparable to 2022 if the delays persist, or we have the potential to do better than that if clarity occurs soon enough so that we can keep projects on track.  I think it's important to recognize that this is a minor amount of capital in the construct of Duke Energy. And so as we think about 2023, we are confident in our 5% to 7% growth rate. So on income recognition, I'll turn it to Steve to talk a little bit about that, Julien, and then we can circle back and see if we resolve these questions. Steve Young : Right. Julien, on the ITC recognition, the past couple of years, the projects we've been looking at are three to five years, in that range, depending on the tax equity arrangement, but we've been in that range. The accelerated depreciation benefits have been overall perhaps five to seven type year spread. That's what we've been looking at. But again, as projects move, we look at what the needs are and what makes sense to the tax equity partner as well. But that's kind of where we've been. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Got it. Okay. Fair enough. And just to clarify there, so how much of that would be shifting? You have shifted, I don't know, half of your portfolio. How much of that impact that 23, just to maybe clarify that?  And then a second question, if I can. -- go forward, Lynn, please. Lynn Good : Well, what we were trying to share, Julien is if we do end up shifting, our expectation is the '23 would be in the range of '22. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Yeah. Got it. Yeah. Forget the permutation is focused on the [Indiscernible]. Lynn Good : Yeah. And then as we look out to 2024, we believe that gives sufficient time, hopefully for these supply chain issues to resolve themselves more clarity on price. And we also see a ramp-up in regulated renewables by the time 2024 rolls around. So we're talking about moving a few projects in the commercial from '22 to '23 if this uncertainty persists. And we'll, of course be monitoring and updating along the way. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Right. Yeah. Clearly, and evidently, this time-related issue, so I very much appreciate that. Just a super quick second question. Just treasuries. You guys have the sensitivity in the slides, et cetera. Can you comment about the impact to your business today from the move in rates that we've seen? Against, lots of different ways to take that, Lynn, where would you go with it? I know you got this $0.12 [Indiscernible] out there? Lynn Good : Yeah. And $0.12 is on the high end, Julien, as you would expect, because we're experiencing that interest rate really on short term at this point, and our dollar averaging into long-term rates. But Steve can take you through specifics. Steve Young : That's right. We gave a sensitivity based on variable rate securities in the portfolio. But we -- some things that we've done to mitigate that very significantly have -- we've increased hedging over the past year and half on some of the securities that we knew we were going to be issuing in '22. We've got about 30% of the securities hedged for '22. And we've hedged even some in '23 that we know are going to occur.  So utilization of that, we've been opportunistically going into the market, working with tenure and timing, which, given our scope and scale, we can do pretty well. So we have significantly knocked down of the $0.12 impact to the plan that you might see through those techniques. Julien Dumoulin-Smith : Got it. Okay, guys. Thank you all very much. Really appreciated. Lynn Good : Thank you, Julien. Operator : Thank you, Julien. Our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research Partners. Jonathan, your line is now open. Jonathan Arnold : Hi. And good morning, guys. Lynn Good : Hi, Jonathan. Steve Young : Good morning. Jonathan Arnold : A quick one on the carbon plan. Obviously, I appreciate you're going to tell us more about that -- tell everyone more about that in a bit. But, Lynn, you mentioned there will be several different options, and that'll encompass different technologies. But would you expect to make a definitive like preferred portfolio recommendation with your filing? Or is it more a range of options and then The Commission will sort of shape that decision on which one to choose? Lynn Good : Hey, Jonathan, it's the latter. We're going to present a range of options on the 70% reduction and then that will be the subject of public hearings and review by the commission. And ultimately, it would be the commission's decision on pace, technologies, price implications, et cetera. And those portfolios reflect the input from stakeholders. So we've had three robust stakeholder meetings. We've also had a series of technical conferences to dig more deeply into topics that are relevant to the carbon plan. So when we file this on Monday, Jonathan, we will come -- provide information to all of you on what's in there. And then, of course, this will be a centerpiece of our discussion over the balance of the year. Jonathan Arnold : Okay. But there's not going to be -- we think this is the best one or anything like that from the sound of it? Lynn Good : No. No. Jonathan Arnold : Great. And then just on -- just in terms of what you're seeing on load and your comments about second quarter probably being the peak, I mean, how is the -- what you've seen -- sorry, first quarter, how has what you've seen in terms of the last few weeks relevant to the trajectory you expected when you gave that year-end 1.5% glide path, I guess? Are you -- has it tracked a little ahead or is it roughly on the line you would have thought? Or any more color you can give us there? Lynn Good : Jonathan, I would say we continue to experience very strong growth in the Carolinas and in Florida and that shows up with customers, it shows up with economic development. And our results reflect that strength.  But we're also monitoring what's going on in the broader economy with inflation and GDP growth expectations. And so that has kept us at our planned level of 1.5% for the full year. And I don't know, Steve, if you would add to that? Steve Young : Yeah, I think we're kind of out of the gate strongly here. But as Lynn said, we're not going to move off 1.5% at this time because there are other factors we need to think about we're early in the year. But it's nice to continue to see the migration in. And when people move in, the commercial is going to follow that, hotels, resorts, et cetera. And we're seeing robust industrial growth just in our service areas due to economic development efforts and just the general good business climate. So hopefully, that will carry through and continue on. But we're off to a good start, but we got to keep an eye on it, not time to change the forecast. Jonathan Arnold : Great. It's been good, but it's enabling you to be a little more conservative as you think about the rest of the year. Lynn Good : That's right. Jonathan Arnold : Great. Thanks so much. Lynn Good : Thank you, Jonathan. Operator : Thank you, Jonathan. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy, your line is now open. Ryan Karnish : Hi, good morning. It's actually Ryan Karnish on for Jeremy. Thanks for taking questions. Can I ask one kind of follow-up on the carbon plan filing. Can you just remind us how that ultimately will show up in your multiyear plan filing? I think you talked about DEP 4Q and DEC 1Q? And just kind of remind us of the big milestones to watch ahead of those filings. Lynn Good : Sure. A couple of things I would note there. Well over 50% of the multiyear rate planning capital will be transmission and distribution investment. We will include some level of renewables and battery storage consistent with the carbon plan, really targeted for the end of the three-year period. So think about projects that would come in service '25-'26.  And the way the rate cases work here in the Carolinas is we do have an opportunity to continue to update capital beyond filing through the date of the hearing. So that will give us an opportunity to fully understand the approved carbon plan and to the extent that the adjustment needs to be made in capital, we would do so at that time.  So I would think about these things running in -- a bit in parallel, Ryan. But given that the majority of the capital is T&D, we don't expect a material impact on the multiyear rate plan from the carbon plant in this three-year cycle. A lot of impact in the next one. Ryan Karnish : Got it. No, that makes sense, very helpful. And then just one on inflation maybe or supply chain impacts even outside of the solar. Just curious, you could hit on a little bit in the script, but just going to trends you're seeing across your cost structure. And how you kind of see that intertwining with your ability to kind of continue taking on O&M? Lynn Good : We continue to see what you're hearing throughout the industry, whether it's raw materials, labor, of course, fuel costs have been front and center. But as Steve, indicated, we are addressing those risks with improved planning, with our long-term contracts, our scale, inventory, substitution, additional suppliers, just a variety of considerations.  And as we look at O&M in particular, we're confident in our trajectory that we had planned for 2022, and maybe a little background there, Ryan. We had originally been planning for a negative 1%. We raised that to flat, giving us some headroom. And so the combination of all the things I mentioned give us confidence that we're on track for O&M in 2022. And we have yet to see any impact to our overall capital plan as a result of these changes. We've been able to address even delays in supply chain, make substitutions in our projects and keep executing for our customers. Ryan Karnish : Got it. No, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. I\u2019ll leave it there. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Ryan. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael, your line is now open. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my --- Lynn Good : Hi, Michael. Michael Lapides : Congrats on a good -- hey, Lynn. And congrats on a good start of the year. I actually have a couple. First of all, O&M. O&M, ex-storms, was up year-over-year. And if I understood Steve's comments correctly, you'll have some O&M pressure in the second quarter with outage schedules, I would assume. How should we think about what that means for the cadence and trajectory of O&M in 2022 ex-storms? Flat, up, down? And if it's down, is it more backend loaded? Steve Young : We had targeted flat, Michael, and it will certainly be at least flat. Our agility efforts frankly, that we are putting in place, I think, could drive it downward. It will be back half. That's just the timing of when things are aligning. But absent storms, I feel good, certainly about being flat to potentially declining. Michael Lapides : Got it. And I know you've got the RFPs coming in Indiana. And I'm just curious of the 2.4 gigawatts. Can you remind me how much of that is renewable versus conventional? And how do you think about what is potentially utility or cell phone versus kind of just under traditional PPA? Lynn Good : So Michael, it breaks down almost 50-50. So 1,100 megawatts of renewable resources, 1,300 megawatts of electric generation. And we continue to believe that utility ownership is valuable to our customers. And we'll be putting that forward in our expectation of building renewables, buying renewables that there would be some degree of utility ownership.  And then we'll know more about the dispatchable resources. The results came in May 2. We're still digesting. The third-party administrator has not shared a lot of specifics on that. But if the renewable is any indication, we'll get robust responses to those resources as well. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then last one. You mentioned quickly in the remarks today that you updated the storm protection plan in filings in Florida. Can you remind me how much of a material -- how material of a change relative to the original filing did that make to your capital spend plan and the revenue requirement for this year and the next couple of years in Florida? Steve Young : Overall, the impact was about a $1 billion increase as a result of updating the SPP filing in Florida, Michael. Michael Lapides : But $1 billion over 10 years, $1 billion over two years? Just can you put some cadence and timing around that for me, please? Lynn Good : I would expect it to be back half of the decade, Michael. You may remember we're under a multiyear rate plan through early 2024. We'll be updating capital in connection with that filing. So it's not going to be in the next couple of years, it would be later. Steve Young : That's right. It was a 10-year filing. So Lynn is right, it would probably be in the back part of the year. We'll catch some of that in the latter part of our five-year plan, but the bulk of it is going to be after that. Michael Lapides : Right. And I thought that, that was covered via a tracker or rider and was separate from the core GRCs or forward-looking test years you have in Florida? Lynn Good : It is. Steve Young : That's correct. It is a rider. It started in late '21, and it's kicking in this year. That's correct. But most of that increase in spend with the updated filing will be in the latter part of the decade. Lynn Good : And Michael, I would suggest that we look at all of these things. The multiyear rate plan, the storm protection plan is a part of an integrated approach to serving customers in Florida and really thinking about how the impact to price and schedule and our construction activities and our capital. So we plan them in a coordinated way. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thanks, Lynn. Thanks, Steve. Lynn Good : Thank you. Steve Young : Sure. Operator : Thank you, Michael. Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Anthony, your line is now open. Anthony Crowdell : Good morning, Lynn. Good morning, Steve. Congrats on a good quarter. Steve Young : Thank you. Anthony Crowdell : Hey, hopefully, just an easy one. A lot of the focus on North Carolina, if I could pivot to South Carolina. Just wondering, I don't believe the state has a decarbonization target yet. I'm wondering when do you think we get more clarity from the state on the decarbonization target. And I guess how would that impact Duke's CapEx plan? Lynn Good : Anthony, I would maybe pull up just a little bit to talk about the alignment between the two states that has existed over decades, whether you think about nuclear or even work around economic development to make sure that we've got investment going in both states. South Carolina has a strong interest in renewable generation. You may remember Act 62 set out some parameters around renewable construction. And we will continue to work with the state on how the clean energy transition should occur so that both states are able to meet their objectives. And I would think about energy policy as being important to both states. The language may be slightly different. The approach, we believe, will be aligned and coordinated in a way that makes sense for our customers and for our investors.  So I'll leave it at that at this point, Anthony. But a lot of work going on to make sure South Carolina is completely up to date on all that is occurring. And I should indicate that they have been very active stakeholders in the carbon plan in the stakeholder meetings here in North Carolina. Anthony Crowdell : Great. And if I could just sneak in one more. Just I think you guys have great clarity on the pressure on renewables. Again, it's probably, I think, 3% of Duke's overall earning. So a pretty small portion. But just -- I don't know if it's for Steve or Lynn, just what kind of toggle -- what kind of leverage would you pull to navigate maybe the pressure on renewables, if I think '23 is flat to '22? Do we look for maybe lower O&M in the utilities to maybe overcome that? Just wanted to clarify where the leverage would be to offset the pressure on renewables. And I'll leave it there. Lynn Good : Yeah. Anthony, I would think about that. I would also think about acceleration of capital in other places in the business. So the types of agility levers we have pulled time and time again to maintain our trajectory. And, Steve, I'll look to you to see if you'd add anything? Steve Young : Yeah, I think that's right. We look at the rider mechanisms that we've got and the investments that we can make there. And our O&M agility is a core muscle that we exercise in these times. And given our scope and scale, we can look across the footprint. We can look at supply chain and various mechanisms within there as well. So a number of tools across the footprint in that vein, Anthony. Anthony Crowdell : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Anthony. Our next question comes from David Paz with Wolfe Research. David, your line is now open. Lynn Good : Good morning, David. David Paz : Good morning, Lynn. How are you doing? Can you hear me okay? Lynn Good : Yeah, we can. Thank you. David Paz : Great. So I appreciate the comments you made on the solar CapEx relatively modest in your current plan. Just curious, how should we think about solar post your current plans. So I think you've given us a range in the back half of the decade. Would you say it's going to be in a similar percentage points? Or was -- are we going to talk materially higher? Lynn Good : David, the thing I would point to as I look at \u201824-\u201825-\u201826, we will be ramping renewable construction in the regulated business in a much more significant way than the short term, the '22-'23 that your customers are seeing.  So think about the Carolinas. We have not had a renewable build in our capital plan in the Carolinas, but that will begin to show up in '24-'25 and '26. We've talked about the fact that we will see an increasing amount of regulated renewables. And that will impact the way we think about capital allocation between regulated and commercial, you'll begin to see that in '24-\u201825. David Paz : Okay. Is it fair to say that whatever projection you have for solar in the Carolinas or at least North Carolina, your plan reflects the ownership level that you -- under the law, that I think is 45% of 50%? Lynn Good : Absolutely, 55-45, 55% utility ownership. Yes. David Paz : Great. And if I can ask a general question, maybe specific to Duke. But just can you talk in about the efforts that you and Duke and maybe the industry generally are conducting really to inform the administration about the DoC solar investigation and maybe just clean energy incentives generally? Lynn Good : Yes. And David, I would say there's been ongoing discussion around clean energy policy, around renewable tax credits, around supply chain issues really dating back to the end of last year continuing into this one. We shared the goal with the administration of reaching a net-zero future. And so these elements that we're talking about are relevant to that conversation.  So we believe a timely and efficient resolution of the Department of Commerce Inquiry is important. We also believe that the renewable tax credits are important for our customers as you think about the level of investment that is planned to reach these goals.  So we're very actively engaged in policies that impact our goals for net zero. And I don't see that changing. David Paz : Okay. Thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, David. This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now pass the conference back over to Lynn Good for any closing remarks. Lynn Good : Well, thank you for participation today for questions, for your investment in Duke Energy. And as always, we're available if there are questions or further follow-up on anything that we've covered today. And look forward to talking to you soon. Thanks, again. Operator : That concludes today's Duke Energy Quarter 1, 2022 conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Joanne, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Duke Energy's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to introduce Jack Sullivan, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Jack Sullivan : Well, thank you, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy's second quarter 2022 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair, President and CEO along with Steve Young, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information within the meaning of securities laws. Actual results may be different than forward-looking statements, and those factors are outlined herein and disclosed in Duke Energy's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information and disclosures, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. So with that, let's turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Jack, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.14 for the quarter, delivering strong results driven by continued growth in electric volumes and favorable weather. We remain on track to deliver within our original guidance range and are reaffirming our full year guidance range of $5.30 to $5.60 with a midpoint of $5.45. We're also reaffirming our long term earnings growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2026, up a midpoint of our original 2021 guidance range. Turning to Slide 5, I'd like to offer context on our announcement this morning to perform a strategic review of our Commercial Renewables business, which has been an integral part of Duke Energy's renewable energy platform over the past 15 years. Since 2007, we've built a portfolio of approximately 5,000 megawatts of Commercial wind, solar and battery projects across the US and established a robust development pipeline. While it represents less than 5% of Duke Energy's earnings, we're proud of the fact, it's among the top 10 largest US renewable companies. But as we look forward to the remainder of this decade and beyond, we have line of sight to significant renewable, grid and other investment opportunities within our faster growing regulated operations as we execute the industry's largest clean energy transition. We believe this is the appropriate time to review the ongoing strategic fit of commercial operations as we prepare for an acceleration in capital spending within our regulated businesses. Our strategic review will be thorough yet timely. We expect to conclude the review later this year or early next and we'll update you along the way. Today, our regulated utility operations represent over 95% of Duke Energy's earnings profile, and have long been the growth engine of our company. We operate premier regulated franchises in growing service territories with constructive regulatory jurisdictions and robust customer focused investment opportunities. Our regulated businesses are strongly positioned to grow within our earnings guidance range of 5% to 7%, providing consistent earnings and cash flow and supporting our attractive dividend. Turning to Slide 6, let me share an overview of the proposed carbon plan we filed with the North Carolina Utilities Commission on May 16th. We've already made significant progress in the Carolinas and this plan continues our transition to lower carbon resources while maintaining affordability and reliability. Our plan contains four portfolios that achieve the interim 70% carbon reduction target and carbon neutrality by 2050. Each portfolio presents a road map to lower emissions through an orderly retirement of coal, replacing it with a diverse set of carbon free and dispatchable resources. The primary difference among the portfolios relates to the pace of deployment and availability of replacement resources. As part of the filing, we've requested the approval of a defined set of near term activities to replacement resources needed regardless of the path selected. This includes new solar, battery storage, onshore wind and hydrogen capable natural gas. We also requested to begin early development of long lead time zero carbon resources, which are needed in the early 2030s, including offshore wind, small modular nuclear and pumped storage. These activities help us preserve option value for a broader set of resources. The results of these development activities will be filed in 2024 with an updated carbon plan, providing the commission with more information as they consider resource selections required to meet carbon reduction targets. We look forward to continued engagement with stakeholders as the NCUC finalizes the carbon plan by year end. Our proposed plan has also been shared with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, and the final plan will be foundational to the next comprehensive South Carolina IRP in 2023. Moving to Slide 7. We have a robust regulatory and legislative plan that is underway in the vibrant economies we serve. Our thriving jurisdictions were highlighted recently in CNBC's Annual List of America's top states for business, which ranked five of the states we serve in the top 15, including North Carolina, which ranked number one for the first time. I'd like to touch on the progress we're making in each of our jurisdictions to continue providing affordable and reliable energy for our customers. In North Carolina, we expect to file a DEP rate case in the fourth quarter, and likely a DEC rate case early next year. Both cases will introduce the modernized rate making tools approved in HB 951, including multiyear rate plans, performance incentive measures and residential decoupling. The NCUC hosted a T&D Technical Conference in late July. DEP presented to the commission and stakeholders and discussed key transmission and distribution investments that enhanced grid resiliency and flexibility, and expand the use of renewables and distributed energy resources on our system. In South Carolina, Storm Securitization legislation was signed into law in June. This creates a valuable tool to recover prior and future storm restoration costs, while saving customers millions of dollars compared to traditional recovery mechanisms. We expect to file an initial application with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina in August, and expect to issue Store Bonds in late 2023 or early 2024. Earlier this week, we gave notice of an upcoming DEP South Carolina rate case. Our first case to be filed in South Carolina since 2018. We expect to file the case in September and anticipate rates to go into effect in the first half of 2023. In Florida, we have placed three out of four solar projects planned for 2022 online, and we remain on track to install a total of 300 megawatts of solar by the end of this year. Shifting to Indiana. The commission approved our $2 billion TDSIC plan, which includes grid modernization investments and improved reliability and resiliency. We will begin executing in 2023 following the completion of our initial TDSIC plan this year. In May, we received a robust response to our request for proposals for generation resources in Indiana. We're evaluating the proposals now and we'll incorporate the results into our CPCN filings later this year. And turning to Ohio. Our electric distribution rate case continues to move forward and the hearing is scheduled to begin in mid-September. In June, we filed an Ohio gas rate case, which is our first detailed review of gas base rates since 2012. Moving to Slide 8, I'd like to touch on the Inflation Reduction Act that was announced this week. Duke Energy has always advocated for policies aligned with our mission to deliver affordable, reliable and increasingly clean energy to our customers. And the clean energy tax provisions of this draft legislation do just that. If passed, the clean energy tax credits will lower our cost of service, which in turn reduces the cost to customers of our energy transition. Furthermore, the transferability provisions can help direct the intended value of these credits to our customers more efficiently. The bill also recognizes the important role that existing nuclear plays with nuclear PTCs awarded to operators of highly efficient nuclear stations. Duke Energy operates the largest regulated nuclear fleet in the US with some of the highest efficiency measures. As such, we would likely qualify for significant nuclear production tax credits, also to the benefit of our customers in the Carolinas. We're pleased to see the strong support of the clean energy provisions in this draft legislation and we look forward to tracking the bill's progress, and we'll keep you informed along the way. In closing, we have a clear path ahead of us as we execute our energy transition and I'm confident in our ability to continue to deliver value to customers and shareholders. Before I hand the call over to Steve, I'd like to comment on some important organizational changes we announced earlier this week. Effective September 1st, Brian Savoy, currently Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy and Commercial Officer, will become Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, succeeding Steve. Brian's deep financial acumen and broad business experience have prepared him well for this role, allowing for a seamless transition. Steve will become Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. One of Steve's main priorities will be to oversee the strategic review of our commercial renewables portfolio that we announced this morning. Steve is an exceptional leader and during his 40-year career, has played an instrumental role in transforming Duke Energy into the strong company it is today. He has been an extraordinary partner of mine and a trusted counselor and his commitment to our company, customers, communities and employees is deeply appreciated and recognized by all of our stakeholders. Brian also shares this commitment and will play a critical role in advancing our strategy while delivering sustainable value to our customers and shareholders. The depth of leadership at this company is impressive, I would say it's second to none. And these changes will further position us for success as we execute the industry's largest clean energy transition. And so with that, thanks to Steve, and let me turn the call over to him. Steve Young : Thanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a brief discussion on our quarterly results, highlighting a few of the key variances to the prior year. As shown on Slide 9, we had reported an adjusted earnings per share of $1.14. This was compared to reported and adjusted earnings per share of $0.96 and $1.15 last year. Please see our non-GAAP reconciliation included in the earnings release materials for more details. Within the segments, Electric Utilities & Infrastructure was up $0.03 compared to the prior year. Results were driven by favorable weather, higher retail volumes and rate increases. Partially offsetting these items were higher O&M, including timing of outages as compared to last year and higher depreciation costs on our growing investment base. Shifting to Gas Utilities and Infrastructure. Results were $0.02 lower due to timing of O&M. In our Commercial business, we were flat with higher wind resources offset by fewer projects placed in service. And in the Other segment, we were $0.02 lower, primarily due to lower market returns on benefit trusts. Turning to Slide 10. I'll touch on electric volumes and economic trends. We continue to see strong volume growth, and our results for the second quarter were approximately 1.5% -- were up approximately 1.5% year-over-year. On a rolling 12 month basis, volumes are up 2.6% and are slightly higher than volumes for 2019, the last full year prior to COVID. We continue to expect our rolling 12 month volume growth rate to moderate throughout the year, but now forecast 2022 load growth between 1.5% to 2%, above our original guidance of 1.5%. Looking at the customer classes. Residential volumes were up 1.2%, bolstered by year-over-year customer growth of 1.8% and the continuation of remote and hybrid work for many office workers. Our Commercial and Industrial classes both increased 1.7%. Within Commercial, we saw the benefit of return to normal business hours. And in Industrial, our load growth was driven by a continued rebound for existing customers, coupled with new load for companies attracted to our service territories. We remain encouraged by our volume recovery, which is supported by the vibrant economies we serve. Moving to Slide 11. I'd like to go over timing considerations for the second half of the year. We expect third quarter adjusted earnings per share will be slightly lower than 2021, mainly due to favorable weather in the prior year, higher interest expense, tax timing and lower contributions from Commercial Renewables. This will be partially offset by higher revenues from rate cases, riders and wholesale. In the fourth quarter, we expect to see favorability from several drivers, including normal weather, higher loan, lower O&M and higher revenue from rate cases and riders. As we discussed on our first quarter call, we expect to hold O&M flat for the year, absent our first quarter storm cost. I'd like to take a moment to discuss several initiatives we're working on to respond to rising interest rates and inflation. To address these macroeconomic headwinds, we're targeting cost mitigation of $200 million across the enterprise beginning in 2023. The key areas we're focusing on are employee driven productivity and cost savings initiatives, digital automation, leveraging our size and scale to reduce cost to our supply chain, tax optimization and reducing regulatory lag through CapEx timing. We believe much of this will be sustainable, similar to what we achieved in 2020 in response to COVID. Over the long term, this effort will benefit our customers and help enable our energy transition, as lower O&M will moderate future rate impacts. For every dollar of O&M we eliminate, we can invest about $7 of capital without increasing cost to customers. Work is underway for each of these initiatives, and we'll provide additional details as we move through the process. Before we open it up for questions, let me close with Slide 12. We're off to a strong start in the first half of the year and are well positioned to achieve our 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $5.30 to $5.60 with the midpoint of $5.45. And this marks the 96th consecutive year of paying a quarterly cash dividend and the 16th consecutive annual increase. As Lynn discussed earlier, we are undertaking a strategic review of our Commercial Renewables business. We will keep you updated on any decisions from the evaluation and any impacts it may have on our future financial guidance. With that, we'll open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shar Pourreza : So Lynn, starting on sort of the Commercial news, there's a lot of renewable assets out there for sale right now. I guess, what prompted the process, why now, did you get unsolicited offers? And maybe just fine tune any sense on timing as we're thinking about presentation packages being sent out and data rooms being set up? Lynn Good : And you know Shar, what I would say on timing is we have been looking at this for some time. I think you have known us to review our portfolio and make strategic decisions about the future a number of times in our history, and this is no exception to that. As we look at the pipeline of regulated investment that is in front of us, over the next many years, we believe this is the right time to step back and really look at the strategic fit of the Commercial business, because there's going to be competition for capital at Duke. And we think we operate a very strong Commercial business that can grow and grow well in the future, and we want to take the opportunity to evaluate as they're a better strategic owner at this moment. And as I think about other portfolios in the market, I believe there will be a robust market for these assets, given that it's not only operating assets, but also a development pipeline, a platform, a team of very capable developers and operators that I think have the potential to add a great deal of value. And if I focus just a moment on the pipeline, we have 1 gig to 1.5 gigs of near term projects that could be quite valuable in 2024, 2025, in addition to what we had planned for 2023. So when we think about our timing for execution, we commented that we'll be completing the strategic review by the end of '22 into early '23. We will move quickly to get information into the market. There is an interest in these types of assets from a broad range of buyers and would hope, Shar, to have more to share as we think about third quarter EEI and then moving into February of next year. Shar Pourreza : And just Lynn, from a numbers perspective, I know you've highlighted that there could be a time in the future where you could need some equity to fund the incremental regulated capital growth opportunities that are out there for you. Could this potential sale, I guess, provide enough balance sheet capacity and threshold improvements where future equity needs are off the table even as capital growth opportunities accelerate? And just remind us what the basis and tax leakage is on the assets. Lynn Good : And as we look at our potential to accelerate and what we believe the potential from this transaction represents, we do think it would postpone equity into the future. But I think we're getting a little bit ahead, because I don't want to comment on value. We have given you an indication that we think the right bias right now is to use the proceeds to avoid debt. It's a high interest rate environment, inflation, a variety of other uncertainties around the economy. But I do think it strengthens the balance sheet in a moment when we see accelerated capital, and that would lead to a period in which we can delay any further equity issuances. On tax leakage, let me turn to Steve just to make a comment on that. Steve Young : A couple of comments here. The book value of this body of assets is approximately $4 billion, and that would include about $1 billion of tax attributes. And we don't see any significant tax leakage if a transaction were to occur. Shar Pourreza : And then just one last one for me, and I'll jump back in the queue. Steve, there's a viewpoint that you may need to rebase. I mean is that a scenario or do you feel that just given the robust nature of the process and the demand for renewables that you could more than sort of offset sort of that lost earnings and maintain the current trajectory? Lynn Good : Shar, I don't want to comment on 2023 guidance at this point. I feel like the process is early. We're going to be testing the market on value. We have given you a sense of how we're thinking about use of proceeds at this point. But what I would point you to is if we are successful in executing a robust transaction, which we have every confidence we will, then Duke Energy lessens volatility, we increase transparency. We draw focus and attention to this regulated business, which I would say it's one of the strongest franchises in the US with 5% to 7% growth and an ability to earn at the top half of that range as we deploy capital and move through the regulatory modernization that sits in front of us. And so I think that's the real takeaway. We'll keep you informed on this process every step of the way and bring guidance at the right time. But I think there's just a strong pipeline of investment and strong confidence in our ability to grow 5% to 7% on the regulated business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Just to keep going on this thought process. I mean, obviously, this has seemingly been in some thought for a little time. How do you think about the accretion dilution and the commitment of pursuing this through? And then related to that, just again, given some of the use of proceeds, considerations, is there a potential that this ends up taking some time all out to align with some of your CapEx needs through the course of the [decade]? Just think about some of the parameters here. Lynn Good : And Julien, I'm not going to comment on value. I think we're too early in the process. We're testing the market. But we do believe we have a very strong set of operating assets, development pipeline, et cetera. We've given you an indication of use of proceeds, so I'd like to leave the comments there. And as the process progresses, we'll move forward and give you more information. The second part of your question, I lost the train\u2026 Julien Dumoulin-Smith: No, I was just thinking about use of proceeds and then perhaps elongating it to align with your CapEx, again, more of a pushing you on the parameters that you alluded to a moment ago. Lynn Good : So use of proceeds, as I said in my comments to Shar, our bias right now would be to use the proceeds to avoid debt. But Julien, as the review progresses, we get a better sense of the market, we're sometime in '23 likely, we will finalize that decision and keep you informed every step of the way. And as I think about the way this will work, when we reach a decision, we will likely move the business to discontinued operations. So the Commercial business would come out. We would give you very clear guidance on the regulated business, and we'll give you a sense of use of proceeds, so we can put all of those various pieces together. And we will do that when we have progressed far enough in the strategic process to have a sense of how to guide you into 2023. But I would point again too, this gives us an opportunity to really draw a great focus and attention on the Regulated business, which is poised to continue to grow at a very healthy pace. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: And to keep going on some of the core operations here. Just with respect to some of the other moving parameters at present, any initial thoughts on the AMC impacts from IRA, again, I guess that's a moving target itself. And then related, obviously, continued success on cost mitigation, and kudos Steve. Just with respect to that, again, we feel fairly good about the outlook '23 onwards and some of the earlier comments that you've made. Again, I get that the gross level of inflation has potentially accelerated against what you guys had previously thought in establishing your EPS CAGR? Lynn Good : Julien, we feel very confident in our ability to execute on cost mitigation. And I think if you track back, COVID and even prior to that, dating back to '15 and '16, we have consistently managed our O&M trajectory in a way that's not only been helpful to investors, but helpful to our customers. It's been part of keeping our prices low in all of our jurisdictions. We are looking at the Inflation Reduction Act, and we see meaningful benefits to customers from the renewable tax credits, the recognition of nuclear, the incentives around critical infrastructure. We will be impacted by the corporate minimum tax but we will also benefit from the credits, which we will pass through our customers. So we're in the early analysis of this, as I know so many others, and we'll be tracking it closely as you would expect us to. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: But not ready to quantify given the moving pieces et cetera, on [Multiple Speakers] debt and cash flow. Okay. Excellent. All the best. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nicholas Campanella with Credit Suisse. Nicholas Campanella : Congrats to Steve and Brian on the new roles. I just wanted to ask, just go back to CEB quick, and I'm just thinking to -- think about contribution in total. Like what is EBITDA for that business? And then also, last quarter, I think you commented that CEB in '23 would be somewhat flattish to '22. So we've had some relief via AVCBD there. So I'm just trying to think of what is like ultimate loss earnings for those assets in '23, how we should we be thinking about that? Lynn Good : Our target for 2022 is around $150 million of net income, which we kind of stepped down the contribution at the end of last year as we saw some of the challenges in supply chain and panel availability, et cetera. We also, in the last call, said we see a trending more in line with that for '23, because despite the favorable executive action, the delay and uncertainty that was created during that period of time really pushed execution of projects from '23 into '24. And so I'll leave it there. I don't know, Steve, if you would add anything to that. Steve Young : No, I think that's correct. We had stepped down the contribution for those years in light of the supply chain issues. And we had kind of capped the earnings throughout our plan prior to that in the $200 million type range per year and stepped it down for the recent supply chain issues. So that's, I think about it in that fashion. Nicholas Campanella : So just run with the $150 million. And then do you have EBITDA for that business that you're willing to disclose or\u2026 Lynn Good : I'll leave it at that, the $150 million. And Nick, Jack and the IR team are available for any further follow-up on specifics. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan Chase. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to look forward to the ESG Day on October 4th. Are there any kind of updated metrics or any other kind of messages we should be looking for at that point in time? Lynn Good : Jeremy, we're really looking forward to ESG Day, because we've had, over the course of this year, a chance to give you some visibility into new targets. So we added Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions. So you can expect to hear more from that. We've also filed our carbon plan. We've also continued to progress our integrated resource plan in Indiana and have continued to build solar in Florida. So we will give you an update on what all of that could mean. You can expect ranges of capital to be discussed as we kind of take all of these plans into a more financial perspective at ESG Day. And then, of course, we'll comment on some of the social issues around environmental [justice, adjust] transition, affordability which is increasingly important, and then, of course, governance. You can expect to have a member of our Board join the conversation. So I think it will be a great day to really hone in on the clean energy transition story that we have here at Duke. We're not only making good progress but we have good plans and targets in place in all of our jurisdictions to continue that work. Jeremy Tonet : And I just want to pick up with the carbon plan a little bit more, if I could. If you could just give us a little bit more flavor on stakeholder conversations. We hear some stakeholders might have different kind of concerns about the proposal. Just wondering if there's any sticking points or alternative pathways around that to get a sense on how that's all going? Lynn Good : Jeremy, it's been a robust stakeholder process. And I would say to you, as we have been engaged in so many meetings and discussions, there are a wide range of topics being discussed but it's nothing that we would say is surprising. And one of the reasons that we put together multiple pathways is really to get all of the topics on the table, so that we could have the kind of discussion, the commission can have the kind of information they need to make decisions. So if I were to just comment briefly on the types of things that are under discussion, there's a lot of agreement on retirement of coal, there's a lot of agreement on near-term actions, particularly solar, storage, wind, a lot of agreement on energy efficiency, demand response being a part of the conversation, a lot of agreement on the need to accelerate integration of renewables, because it's not just a matter of naming megawatts, it's a matter of getting them interconnected. And then I think if I were to talk a little bit about areas of differing points of view, some are more aggressive on how quickly solar comes in. Some are more optimistic on the pricing of storage and pricing of offshore wind. Some believe we could do more onshore wind than what we consider. And then, of course, a lot of discussion on the attributes of natural gas, the assumptions on price and the role that natural gas should play. So in price, I put price as a top of mind consideration on the minds of our industrials as well as customers in general. So I think this just provides a fruitful menu of items and discussions that will result in a thoughtful plan. I think as you know, we have asked for authority to move on the no-regrets elements of the plan. Not to lock into any specific one, allow things to continue to mature, prices on certain technologies to continue to decline. And I think there will be just a really good discussion. Hearings are scheduled for mid-September. We will be filing testimony in late August. So there will be more data points along the way that we can share with you as this process continues. Jeremy Tonet : Just the last one, if I could. Just want to touch on nuclear a bit here, and your understanding of the nuclear PPCs and as supply to regulated nuclear and level of benefits you see there. And just also if you could update us on Duke's involvement in SMRs and any thoughts on that technology going forward. Lynn Good : You know Jeremy, we're digesting what we know about the Inflation Reduction Act at this point. We believe regulated plans are included in that consideration. And frankly, we're really pleased to see nuclear being recognized as a critical part of the clean energy transition. We're a believer of that at Duke. And as we look at the credits, we believe there's value for those, who are low cost producers, and Duke certainly is. So we'll learn more as this law progresses and have an opportunity to share more with you as we know more. And of course, the bill has to pass before we can give you any true specifics. On the SMRs and advanced nuclear, we are working on both technologies, I would say, an advisory capacity and a capacity to understand more to lend our operating expertise. We do not have an intention of being version one of anything, first of a kind. We would like to see a broader adoption of the technologies, a broader understanding of not only operating characteristics, but the commercial attributes of price, ability to construct them within a time frame that we're comfortable with. And so we see this decade of the 2020s as an important one to continue that work. And if it progresses as we all hope it does, we would be in a position to potentially invest in one to come into service in the early 2030s. So more to come on that. This will be a fruitful area of discussion in front of the commission. I think you know that we operate in the Carolinas for 50% of the power today comes from nuclear, so it's an important part of the equation in the Carolinas. And if there's a way to add to it in an economic way that's affordable to our customers and fits with the expectations of our regulators, we would welcome the opportunity to do that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Durgesh Chopra : Steve, congrats and thank you for your very patient CFO. Thank you for answering all of our very detailed annoying questions over the years. I appreciate it. Maybe just really quickly, is there any debt on the renewable assets that we are pursuing a strategic review on? Steve Young : Yes, there is. There's about $1.6 billion of project debt on the Commercial Renewables assets. Durgesh Chopra : And that's included in the $4 billion number that you gave us, the value I wasn't sure that was the equity value or the enterprise value. Steve Young : Yes, that's correct. Durgesh Chopra : And then Lynn, just wanted to get your thoughts on the -- conceptually on this transferability topic. Obviously, this version of the plan doesn't have direct pay, but it has transferability. How would you compare and contrast this versus tax equity? And as a concept what's the market for these credits? Just any color you could share there would be appreciated. Lynn Good : Durgesh, we have been spending some time thinking about this. What we like about transferability is we do believe there could be some efficiency in the market to move cash, which would be valuable to our customers. It has been a concept that has been used for certain state tax attributes. But the market, I think, will be quite different if we introduce credits of this level. And so I think trying to forecast how the tax equity market would react to the introduction of this market and who shows up to be a counterparty for transferability is something we're spending some time on. I don't have all the answers. But we do like the introduction of another technique that more efficiently moves cash with a hope and expectation that a liquid market develops at a level that would monetize these credits for our customers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Steve, congrats on the new role and same for your successor as well. Regulated capital spend that you laid out in your fourth quarter deck, relative to what we know today, just on the regulated side. Can you talk to us about the puts and takes about what maybe has moved around, maybe has some upside to it, maybe have some downside to it, when we think about that capital spend directional guidance? Lynn Good : Michael, what I would say to you on regulated spend, I'm going to focus on the Carolinas just for a moment. We used one of the 2020 IRP scenarios to develop that capital plan, recognizing that we were going to put a carbon plan in front of the Commission, it needed to be reviewed. And so there will be a fine tuning of Carolina capital coming out of carbon plan. We also were on the technical conference on the multiyear rate plan and put forward recommended range of transmission and distribution that will be filed in connection with the cases that are upcoming. So there could be some fine tuning there. And then I think about just around the corner, we'll be opening up 27, when we come to the Street in February. And I think we've talked to you about the fact that we see an acceleration of capital in the back half of the year as we get deeper into the multiyear rate plan, deeper into coal retirements, deeper into replacement generation. So we do see that capital trending up and we'll have an opportunity to give you some perspective on that at ESG Day. Michael Lapides : And that capital trending up, is that more of a post 2025 and maybe the '23 to '25 doesn't move a lot? Lynn Good : Yes, I would think about it as post 2025, because honestly, Michael, 2025 is tomorrow for us, when you think about large infrastructure build. The other thing I would point to is there will be some fine tuning of capital in Indiana as a result of the Integrated Resource Plan, the CPCN process that we plan to file later this year. So that's another update that you can expect from us. Again, it will be more in the back half of the decade as we move more deeply into our clean energy transition in Indiana. Michael Lapides : And then one final one, Lynn. Just curious on coal generation retirements, both in the Carolinas and in Indiana. Given supply chain issues for battery and a little bit for solar panels, as well as just given high commodity prices, does that have you rethinking the time line for coal power plant retirements? Lynn Good : Michael, it's a good question, because there are puts and takes on that question from every direction. And what I mean by that, you've highlighted supply chain issues on the replacement side, you also highlighted fuel prices for natural gas generation. But frankly, coal, the supply of coal, the logistics of getting coal from point A to point B are also a challenge. And so we cannot assume that there is some steady-state perfect situation here. We have to manage all of this. And so trying to find the right balance between timing of coal retirement and replacement generation is something that we're spending a lot of time and attention to and also trying to ensure for the period of time that the coal assets are with us that we have a reliable supply. There have been labor shortages in the railroads, labor shortages in the mining community, the global market has impacted coal and pricing. So I would just raise that as another dimension to your question that we're also working on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Anthony Crowdell : Congrats on the new position, Brian and Steve, wish you best of luck. Just two quick questions. Lynn, one, I understand the size of the Renewal business relative to Duke. But do you think the sale of the Renewable business will have any impact to like ESG ratings that Duke Energy has such as, hey, maybe they're not as focused on ESG as previously? Lynn Good : Anthony, I appreciate you asking that question, because I want to unequivocally say, no. Because when we talk about our carbon reduction targets, and what we're trying to accomplish by 2030 and 2050, it's all within our regulated business. So we have not taken credit for any Commercial Renewables in our clean energy targets that we have shared with you. It will mean that we'll have a fewer number of megawatts of renewables until that regulated renewable growth accelerates in the back part of the decade, because we'll sell some of them. But our commitment around carbon reduction, the clean energy transition is unchanged. All of our targets are on track and this will give us an opportunity at ESG Day to really zero in on that even more and make it very clear. But I appreciate the question because it's an important one. Anthony Crowdell : And just lastly, on load trends, it looks like you're coming in maybe above your original 2022 guidance of 1.5%. I'm curious, what do you see long term? It seems that maybe the electrification of the economy is accelerating than maybe we previously thought. Maybe a couple of years ago, we were talking about flat as the new up. Do you think going forward, 1% or 2% may be the new norm as we -- hybrid work and all these other things come to benefit the electric utility? Steve Young : Anthony, we look at that very closely. And back in February, we had projected that after '22, it was pretty flat. Our growth through the rest of our five year plan, electricity sales, weather normal was pretty flat. And we're keeping an eye on energy efficiency products that are getting rolled out in addition to electrification. And these are variables that we do look at as we project our load. We'll be updating that as we move forward. But right now, we're going to stick with pretty flat load growth throughout our planning horizon and hope for that upside on that. Lynn Good : And Anthony, what I would add to that is we believe that discipline around cost management is really grounded in the fact we're not putting in overly optimistic assumptions on loads. So we manage our cost structure consistent with sort of a flat expectation on load growth. But when I look at some of the trends around in migration in the Southeast, I look at these economic development numbers and the business ratings of our states, we do have some tailwinds on growth, that I think we will enjoy for a period of time. But we continue to believe this flat to 0.5% is the best way to manage the business and always hope to be surprised to the upside. Anthony Crowdell : My last question will be, Steve, you brought up about energy efficiency as maybe a headwind to demand growth. Do you think as we -- we had big energy efficiency gains in appliances, home construction over the years and we've just reached maybe the peak of the energy efficiency gains. And right now, we're just all really small gains that you're going to get with upgrading a refrigerator, a new appliance and that will be the pivot in demand? Steve Young : Well, we'll continue to monitor that. We do see a desire to increase energy efficiency as part of carbon reduction plans. You'll see that as an increasing area, for example, in our North Carolina plan. And one of the things that's helpful to us as we move forward is we're also going to have residential unbundling as part of our multiyear rate plan. And that takes away that volatility for that large customer class on usage, whether it's weather or just growth as well. So I think we've got protection there if we saw economic issues or energy efficiency coming along to affect the top line demand. Lynn Good : And Anthony, the only other thing I would point to is energy efficiency hasn't been uniformly adopted across all of our customer classes. So we do have an opportunity, particularly with low income and vulnerable customers, to continue to drive energy efficiency. And I also believe that home energy management technology, time-of-use rates, other things that give us an ability to help a customer move their usage around and minimize is an opportunity that will lower price to customers over time, giving us headroom for these clean energy investments. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. We'll now turn it over to Lynn Good to conclude the call. Lynn Good : Great. Thank you, and thanks to everyone who has joined us today. A strong quarter, a lot of promise ahead. We're available this afternoon for questions as we always are. And again, congratulations to Steve and Brian on their new roles. So thanks again for your investment in Duke Energy. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, all and welcome. My name is Brica and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Duke Energy Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Jack Sullivan, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Jack Sullivan : Thank you, Brica and good morning everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy\u2019s third quarter 2022 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair, President and CEO, along with Brian Savoy, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today\u2019s discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information within the meaning of securities laws. Actual results maybe different than forward-looking statements and those factors are outlined herein and disclosed in Duke Energy\u2019s SEC filings. The appendix of today\u2019s presentation includes supplemental information and disclosures and along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. So with that, let\u2019s turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Jack, thank you and good morning everyone. Before I begin, I\u2019d like to take a moment and recognize the work of our team in responding to Hurricane Ian, one of the most powerful and destructive storms in U.S. history. Duke Energy mobilized 20,000 people working day and night to restore power to over 2 million customers across Florida and the Carolinas. And what\u2019s more impressive is the speed in which we did it, with 99% of our customers restored within 72 hours. This is an amazing accomplishment and a testament to our strong corporation, the tireless effort of our restoration teams and the value of our grid-hardening investments. Moving to our financial results today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.78 for the third quarter. We continue to see strong volumes from the electric utilities offset by lower contributions from commercial renewables due to fewer projects placed in service compared to 2021. Turning to the commercial renewables business, we have completed the strategic review and our Board has authorized the sale of this business. I will provide more context about this decision in a moment, but first, I\u2019d like to address what this means for our 2022 earnings guidance. Beginning in the fourth quarter, we will move commercial renewables to discontinued operations and remove it from guidance going forward. Bringing focus to our core regulated businesses, we are updating full year 2022 adjusted earnings guidance to a range of $5.20 to $5.30. The $5.25 midpoint of this updated range represents our original guidance midpoint of $5.45, less the $0.20 contribution we originally forecasted for commercial renewables. The regulated utilities remain on track for 2022 with strong operating results offsetting rising financing costs giving us confidence in achieving earnings within this tighter range. Turning to Slide 5, in August, we announced a strategic review of the commercial renewables business, which includes our utility scale renewables platform in a smaller distributed generation business. As part of this review, we have worked with advisers to evaluate the strategic fit of these businesses and to test the market on valuation. We have received indications of interest for the utility scale business at attractive valuations and this process will continue through year end. We expect to announce a definitive transaction in Q1 2023 and close as early as midyear. We are preparing the sale process for the distributed generation business, which includes REC Solar and expect this transaction will follow a similar timeline to closing. The majority of proceeds from both transactions will be used to reduce holding company debt. This will strengthen the balance sheet and allow us to fund our clean energy transition with our common equity issuances through at least 2027. I am very proud of our commercial team who has remained focused on maximizing the value of the portfolio, continuing to expand our robust development pipeline and operating a renewables fleet with excellence. With this pending change in our business mix, I\u2019d like to walk you through our earnings trajectory over the next 2 years. For 2023, we are introducing a guidance range of $5.55 to $5.75, with a midpoint of $5.65. This reflects 5% to 7% growth of the updated 2022 EPS midpoint of 5.25%. It also includes a partial year benefit from lower interest expense after reducing holdco debt with sales proceeds. Turning to 2024 and beyond, we expect to grow 5% to 7% off the $5.65 midpoint of our 2023 guidance range through 2027. The 2023 guidance range reflects what we know today, including the present interest rate environment, inflation, supply chain constraints and an economic forecast that continues to support positive GDP growth in 2023. But the economic outlook remains uncertain and we will continue to closely monitor trends. Consistent with past practices, we will do all we can to control costs to match challenges in our business while maintaining excellent service to our customers. As a result, we have increased our 2023 cost mitigation target from $200 million to $300 million. We expect about 75% of these savings to be sustainable over the long-term. We will keep you apprised along the way and look forward to sharing our traditional guidance package on the year end earnings call in February. Brian will provide more on our 2023 earnings drivers, but I want to underscore the strength of our underlying core utility business. We operate premier regulated franchises in growing service territories with constructive regulatory jurisdictions and robust customer-focused investment opportunities. They have always been the lifeblood of our company. And this portfolio transition will fully highlight the strong, predictable, transparent earnings and cash flows from our premier regulated utilities and strengthen our overall investor value proposition. Next, I\u2019d like to take a few minutes to highlight some of the important strategic work underway throughout our jurisdictions. Moving to Slide 6, in October, we filed our first performance-based regulation application under HB 951. We filed with the North Carolina Utilities Commission requesting a review of the significant investments we are making for our 1.5 million Duke Energy Progress customers served in North Carolina. The rate increase would cover upgrades we have made to improve grid reliability and resiliency and to facilitate a clean secure energy future. Our application contains a traditional base rate case based on historical investments and known in measurable changes projected through April of 2023. Our request is mitigated by a reduction in annual operating costs of over $100 million since our last rate case. In addition to historic investments, our application includes gradual customer rate step-ups over the next 3 years to recover future investments we will make through the multiyear rate plan. This consists of roughly $3.8 billion of capital projects that are projected to go into service by 2025. Approximately 75% of which is related to transmission and distribution investments. Evidentiary hearings are expected to begin in the May 2023 timeframe. Consistent with past practice, we intend to implement temporary rates in June for the historic base case subject to refund. If approved, we expect year one revised rates to be effective by October 1, 2023. Turning to Slide 7, our focus on providing customers with affordable, reliable and cleaner energy continues to advance across each of our jurisdictions. In North Carolina, carbon plan hearings concluded in late September after almost 3 weeks and we submitted our proposed order at the end of October. During the hearing, we presented strong testament that confirms the need for our near-term development activities. The MCU team will make a final decision on the carbon plan by the end of this year. We expect to file a Duke Energy Carolinas rate case with the NCUC in early 2023. In South Carolina, we filed a rate case for Duke Energy Progress in September, as we continue to work on increasing system reliability and resiliency and enhancing the customer experience. To ease the impact of these investments on customers, proposed rates would go into effect over 2 years beginning in the first half of 2023. In Florida, the Public Service Commission approved our storm protection plan update in October. Over the next 10 years, we expect to deploy $7 billion in capital investments through this rider. Shifting to the Midwest and Indiana, we are updating our integrated resource plan. We have held the first of three public information sessions with stakeholders to share information about plans under consideration and we anticipate filing CPCNs for new generation resource needs with the Commission beginning in early 2023. And in Ohio, we completed a hearing in October for our electric distribution rate case. We expect to receive a final order by the end of 2022 or early 2023. Moving to Slide 8, I\u2019d like to update you on our ongoing review of the clean energy provisions under the IRA legislation. High energy costs are top of mind for our customers and the IRA\u2019s clean energy tax credits present an opportunity to help address those issues. We expect to qualify for a variety of PTCs and ITCs that will generate billions of dollars in tax credits over the next decade. These tax credits will be returned to our customers, lowering our overall cost of service and providing for a more affordable energy transition. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the corporate minimum tax as new information and guidance from treasury becomes available. Because of the credits generated by our substantial clean energy infrastructure investments, we do not expect this to have a material impact on our cash flows. In closing, we are advancing our strategy across our jurisdictions, balancing the progress of our clean energy transition while preserving affordability and reliability for our customers and communities. I am confident in our long-term earnings growth and ability to execute our strategy moving forward. As I look ahead, we are well positioned to deliver exceptional value to our customers, stakeholders and investors. And with that, let me turn the call over to Brian. Jack Sullivan : Thanks, Lynn and good morning, everyone. I will start with a brief discussion on our quarterly results, highlighting a few of the key variances to the prior year. As shown on Slide 9, we had reported earnings per share of $1.81 compared to $1.79 last year. As Lynn shared, we are moving forward with the sale of our commercial renewables business and we will move those results to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter. For presentation purposes, going forward, our focus will be on the strong earnings profile of our core regulated operations, which delivered $1.78 in adjusted EPS in the third quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, our core operations generated earnings of $4.15 compared to $4.10 for 2021. Please see our non-GAAP reconciliation included in the earnings release for more details. Within our core business segments, Electric Utilities & Infrastructure was up $0.06 compared to the prior year, driven by higher retail volumes and lower O&M. Partially offsetting these items were higher depreciation costs on our growing investment base. We continue to be encouraged by the sustained retail load growth in the post-COVID environment and I will provide more on the volume trends in a moment. Shifting to Gas Utilities & Infrastructure, results were $0.01 higher than last year due to increases in riders in the North Carolina Piedmont rate case. And in the other segment, we were $0.07 lower primarily due to higher financing costs, timing of tax expense and lower returns on investments. Turning to Slide 10, I will touch on electric volumes and economic trends. On a 12-month rolling average basis, total retail volumes are up 1.7%, in line with our 2022 load growth forecast of 1.5% to 2%. In the third quarter, higher year-over-year volumes were driven by residential customer growth of 1.7%. We continue to see strong and steady migration to our service territories and continuing expansion in the commercial class, including higher data center usage. This was partially offset by lower industrial volumes, isolated to a few automotive customers experiencing supply chain constraints. We are closely monitoring how these factors and other potential economic dynamics are impacting our customers\u2019 usage, but we continue to expect 2022 volume growth to land within our 1.5% to 2% range. Our economic development achievements to attract jobs and capital investment to our service territories were recently recognized by Site Selection magazine, which named Duke Energy, a top utility for economic development for the 17th consecutive year. We have continued to accelerate this work into 2022. We partnered with our states to win record-setting projects in North Carolina with semiconductor manufacturer Wolfspeak in South Carolina with BMW\u2019s entry into the EVs market and in Indiana with the Stellantis Samsung EV battery plant. These projects and others announced throughout 2022 involve capital investments exceeding $20 billion and we will bring more than 24,000 jobs to our growing service territories. We will begin to see top line growth from these business expansions as we progress through the 5-year plan. We will breakdown the outlook for the fourth quarter on Slide 11. We are well positioned to achieve our updated $5.25 adjusted EPS midpoint for 2022. Year-to-date, our core regulated business has generated earnings, adjusted earnings of $4.15. We expect a solid finish to the year with continued strong performance in our regulated utilities. We have good line in sight to the remaining $1.10 in the fourth quarter. Let me take a moment to highlight some of the key drivers. Beginning with the Electric segment, we expect year-over-year revenue favorability from higher volumes, which were impacted by the Omicron variant in 2021, a return to normal weather and the Florida multiyear rate plan and other riders. Turning to gas, we e will benefit from rate cases and our integrity management riders. We will see lower O&M across our electric and gas operations. The timing of plant outages and shaping of O&M led to higher O&M in the first half of 2022 as compared to 2021. We saw this trend begin to reverse in Q3 and expect it to accelerate in Q4. Finally, we expect the other segment to be unfavorable to the prior year, primarily due to higher interest expense. Moving to Slide 12, I will highlight the key growth drivers for 2023 that support our $5.55 to $5.75 EPS range for the year. 2023 reflects the acceleration of investments in our clean energy transition across our service territories and the implementation of key provisions from House Bill 951. Beginning with the Electric segment, we will enter 2023 with load that is 2% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Going forward, we expect load growth to be back in line with our pre-pandemic consumption of flat to 0.5% growth per year. This will be offset by weather, which has been favorable year-to-date in 2022. Shifting to rate cases and riders, we have an active regulatory calendar across our jurisdictions. This includes three rate cases in the Carolinas and two rate cases in Ohio. In Florida, we will move to the second year of our multiyear rate plan with an updated 10.1% ROE. Finally, we see growth through continued investment in our electric and gas riders. Macroeconomic conditions remain dynamic. And as Lynn mentioned earlier, we\u2019re exercising our business agility by increasing our 2023 cost mitigation target from $200 million to $300 million. We have a strong track record of pulling both structural and tactical levers to flex our costs to meet business challenges head on and are confident we can achieve these savings. Lastly, we will enjoy a partial year benefit of interest expense savings from reduced holdco debt with proceeds from the commercial renewables sale. Before we open it up for questions, let me close with Slide 13. With the pending sale of our commercial business, we will transition to a fully regulated business with robust investment opportunities, roughly $145 billion over the next decade. This also positions the company with a derisked earnings profile, giving us confidence in achieving our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.55 to $5.75 and 5% to 7% growth rate. With that, we will open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have the first question on the phone lines from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. Shar Pourreza : Hey, good morning, guys. Lynn Good : Hi, Shar. Brian Savoy : Good morning. Shar Pourreza : Good morning. So when you guys put out a \u201823 guidance figure out there without a commercial deal actually being announced. I know obviously, you see robust interest but the ultimate transaction multiple here matters a lot. And can you maybe touch a little bit on your sort of level of confidence here ahead of selecting a better \u2013 do you have some firm offers that\u2019s giving you this kind of visibility into \u201823 and to have this type of an EPS range or recent deals in New York, a good proxy? Have you narrowed down the bidders? I guess, \u2013 just some more visibility on this pending deal that\u2019s kind of embedded in your \u201823 guide would be really helpful and if there is any conservative bend here? Thanks. Lynn Good : Thanks, Shar. Sure. I would start by saying sure we have a lot of experience in dealing with portfolio transactions if you think about the history of Duke. And as we began the strategic review process, a lot of work has been done, not only to challenge our strategic assumptions, but also to do work in the market, hiring advisers, understanding the range of potential valuations, including soliciting feedback from the market and feedback from credible counterparties. So we do have indications of interest, robust indications of interest from credible counterparties and have a high degree of confidence that we will transact on this business. All of that went into our decision to announce the sale. So that\u2019s kind of consistent with the way we would approach anything of this magnitude and this type of decision to do our homework before we announce. So when we look at the guidance range for 2023. We not only have commercial renewables contemplated, but the high degree of confidence will execute, but we have strong regulated growth. And we also have strong cost mitigation already in place and ready to go in light of some of the headwinds that we\u2019re all experiencing in the economy. So I feel like we\u2019ve put together a very credible guidance range for a company that represents 1 of the strongest regulated utilities in the industry, we feel like 2023 is off to a strong start. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then just tax leakage, I guess you guys have enough in plan to offset any kind of leakage there from the sale? Lynn Good : We believe we can manage within this range, Shar. We wouldn\u2019t have put it out there if we didn\u2019t think we could do that, so high degree of confidence in executing and a high degree of confidence in the range. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. And then lastly, when turning to the carbon plan. Obviously, the commission has been very clear at hearings and then filings that intends to meet that December 31 deadline to have a fine to order and an initial plan in place? I mean, obviously, you guys highlighted last week, you filed the proposed order in the docket supporting a real wide range of different technologies. But everyone seems to be kind of in different directions. It doesn\u2019t appear we have a lot of consensus, more over a dozen parties that are involved. So it\u2019s a little bit more contentious than we would have thought. I guess how does the commission bridge these gaps, it seems to be a little bit of a tight time frame by year end? Thanks. Lynn Good : Sure. Shar, what I would say to you is the feedback in this process is something that looks reasonable and somewhat predictable to us. So the solar industry is interested in more solar. The industrials are interested in low prices. Low income we\u2019re interested in the impact to low income. Attorney general and the environmental community want us to go as fast as we can to reduce carbon. So as we look at how the hearing rolled out the testimony that we presented the case that we put forward, we felt like all of those positions were well understood, we\u2019re well discussed in the hearing and didn\u2019t find them surprising in any way, frankly. But that\u2019s what creates kind of the fertile ground for the commission to make decisions. And the good news is, in the near-term, it\u2019s all about solar and battery. And we have time on the long-term to make decisions about some of the more difficult pump storage, SMR offshore wind. And so we think there is a strength to our recommendation to use the next couple of years to look at development on those key technologies so that we\u2019re prepared by the middle of the decade to make the decisions about where to go. So I would say a very good process, a very transparent process, not surprising in any way on where the parties put forward their positions. And I think the commission has a lot of good information on which to make their decision, and we expect them to do so by the end of the year. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Terrific, guys. Thanks so much and we will see about a week. Appreciate it. Lynn Good : Yes. Thanks, Shar. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead, Julien Dumoulin. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, Lynn and team. Thanks, guys very much. Lynn Good : Hi, Julien. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning. Just following up on Shar\u2019s question, maybe a couple of details tied to it. Again, I see the discount off. So can you talk a little bit about the partial year assumption of lower interest expense? Just what\u2019s the timing assumed there? I know people are looking very carefully at these \u201823 numbers. So just if you can elaborate there. And then related, actually, I\u2019ll just ask you the follow-up would be, can you elaborate a little bit on effectively the $0.30 of cost reductions of the $300 million how does that square with the earlier sensitivity you provided against interest rates at this point, effectively, where are you on \u201823 and beyond assumptions on sort of effectively fully offsetting that impact? Lynn Good : Sure. And Julien, I think for planning purposes, we are thinking about the commercial renewables transaction is being mid-year. And we will know more as we get into the final round, bidding, etcetera, and hope to be able to give you more feedback in the February call. But I think midyear is the partial year would be the right planning assumption. And on the cost reduction, I think you\u2019ll recall that back in the second quarter, we had undertaken something that we call the work reduction initiative, really focused on ways we can simplify work, use digital technologies in order to streamline our governance processes, our reporting processes, etcetera, and we were targeting $200 million. We were also, at the same time, looking at supply chain and looking at other things that we could do to potentially more tactically move O&M out of \u201823. And we were able to increase that $200 million target to $300 million. We have sized that, Julien, to give us confidence around the macroeconomic trends. So when I look at interest rates, for example, we are in a position with the work that we\u2019ve done to be able to hit this guidance range despite the headwind of interest rates. And as we look ahead beyond 2023, we have modest amounts of maturities in \u201824. And we also see the benefit of the IRA showing up more materially in 2024. I think we\u2019ve talked about the nuclear PTCs being consequential for us. We see IRA is not only benefiting customers but being credit positive, cash flow positive to the utility. So we feel like we\u2019ve got good plans in place here and are really pleased that we got after cost reduction. As you know, we always do early enough in 2022 that we have a high degree of confidence for 2023 and beyond. We think that the $300 million, 75% of it is sustainable. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And if I may, just to continue with that thought, the unsustainable piece, that remaining 25%. Is that order of magnitude pretty comparable to the interest savings that you get from the tailwind in the 24 from the first half of the year would be commercial renewables having a run rate impact on the sale? Lynn Good : Julien, I haven\u2019t thought about it that specifically because the way I approach every year is looking for a way to save money. So we may come up with some new ideas in 2023 for 2024. The continuous improvement mindset at Duke runs pretty deep, and we\u2019re always trying to some ways to reduce costs. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And so the cash flow uplift on the nuclear side to your credit metrics, just to elaborate on that, if you can. I know things are still in flux a bit, but if you can quantify that? Lynn Good : Julien, it\u2019s several hundred million dollars, we believe. We believe our regulated fleet qualifies and we operate very low cost, very low cost nuclear units. And so we will be working with our regulators on the appropriate way to recognize those benefits. And those scenarios could have a range of passing it back over 2 years, 3 years, 5 years. And in the meantime, we have the opportunity to strengthen the balance sheet or the cash flows, if you will, from those credits. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you again. Good luck. I will see you soon. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We now have the next question from the line of Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead when you ready. Steve Fleishman : Hi, good morning. Lynn Good : Hi, Steven. Steve Fleishman : Hi, Lynn. So just I think you just answered this on Julien\u2019s question, but just to maybe ask again a little differently. So obviously, the cost cutting offsets a lot of pressures in \u201823 in \u201824 and beyond. As you mentioned, the cost cutting moderates, and it goes through regulated rates also and \u2013 but the holdco debt refinancing and stuff continues, assuming rates stay high. But it sounds like what you\u2019re thinking is that the improved cash flow and performance at the utilities kind of could sustain the offset? Is that how to think about beyond \u201823? Lynn Good : Steve, I would maybe expand the thinking to be a little broader on that. So we also use tools like interest rate hedging, which you would expect us to. We have $1 billion of proceeds from GIC coming in. we have the commercial renewable transaction. We have cost mitigation. We\u2019ve sized it at $200 to $300 million in this year. That will carry forward, and we will continue to look for ways to drive costs out of the business. We also have the IRA coming. So I feel like we\u2019ve got a variety of tools. And as we look at sort of the profile into \u201824, even in this present environment, we don\u2019t have a lot of additional headwinds because of a relatively light maturity period. So I would think about all of those factors together and recognize that we are working very strategically to minimize these costs and to manage the business effectively. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Great. And then just in terms of thinking about kind of dividend growth, should we \u2013 given that there is some kind of reset a little bit on the earnings, just should we assume you continue at kind of a rate below the earnings growth for another couple of years before you move it up into the earnings growth range? Lynn Good : Steve, it\u2019s a really good question. And one we\u2019re looking at closely, we had set a target of being in the 65% to 70% payout range. And in this 5-year period, we will be well positioned in that range. So our expectation would be to recommend a dividend increase at the right time in the 5-year period to match something closer to the growth in the business. But I think 2% is a good planning assumption for \u201823. We will look at it again in \u201824 and beyond. But this is something that\u2019s getting a lot of attention in light of the derisking of the business in the light of the strength of the capital, the cash flow we\u2019re anticipating and the work that we\u2019ve done to moderate the payout ratio. Steve Fleishman : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, Steve. We now have David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro : Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Lynn Good : Good morning. David Arcaro : I was wondering if you could just maybe elaborate a little bit more around the load growth backdrop that you\u2019re seeing. And for the \u2013 it sounded like flat to 0.5% growth assumed into 2023. What are the puts and takes there? Is that conservative based on what you\u2019ve seen so far this year? And then would be just curious on that industrial slowdown that you\u2019ve seen, do you expect that to continue into 2023 as well? Is that factored in? Lynn Good : And David, I\u2019ll make a couple of comments and then turn it over to Brian. We use a conservative load growth assumption in our planning. We size our cost structure to be consistent with that. We \u2013 but when I look at the strength of the economy that we are enjoying right now and the volumes that are coming through, we have \u2013 we\u2019re very well positioned. And Brian made a comment in his remarks that we\u2019re already 2% above pre-pandemic levels, which I think is quite an extraordinary rebound. But Brian, how would you add to that and maybe talk a little bit about the industrial. Brian Savoy : Sure. Yes. So first, on the general economy, David, we continue to see migration into our territories. And it\u2019s driving both the residential and the commercial class. So those growth profiles are strong. And as Lynn said, we use conservative assumptions as we look out in future years to really size our business. On the industrial side, we\u2019ve seen some companies with planned shutdowns this quarter. So we don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a trend that\u2019s going to linger. It was planned as well as some of the supply chain bottlenecks that continue to show up in different pockets industry. The automotive sector was on this quarter that surfaced. But again, those things are worked out over time and nothing systemic. So we are still bullish on all three sectors. Lynn Good : No, David, some of the statistics we shared with you on economic development are also noteworthy. And that\u2019s not even a complete list of what\u2019s happened in 2022. North Carolina was rated number one for business for a reason, which low tax environment and a good workforce, great university system, and we have had an extraordinary year from an economic development standpoint. And we expect that to show up over the 5-year period. David Arcaro : Got it. Thanks so much. That\u2019s helpful. And then was interested in just expanding a bit more on the cost reduction outlook into 2023. What are you seeing for inflationary pressures right now in the O&M budgets? Obviously, the backdrop has been tough in terms of inflation pressures, but you are expanding the cost reduction aspirations into next year. Wondering just how achievable that looks and what pressures you are seeing in the current environment? Lynn Good : We do see some inflationary pressures. I would point to materials. I would point to labor, but all of that, David was a part of the analysis that went into our cost reduction efforts. So, I don\u2019t see anything happening in the inflation environment that\u2019s impacting our commitment to drive these costs out of the business. And the other thing I would point to, a lot of the material inflation is showing up in our capital plan. And so we are monitoring that as well to make sure that we are spending capital in a prudent way to benefit customers. David Arcaro : Okay. Understood. I appreciate it. Thanks so much. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : We now have Nick Campanella of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Lynn Good : Hi Nick. Nick Campanella : Hey. Good morning everyone. Thanks. Hi. So, I guess just \u2013 thanks for the updates on the CAGR. It sounds like you are now kind of including the inflation outlook going forward. So, that\u2019s great. And I recall on just previous calls and talking about the CAGR, you kind of talked about getting to the higher end of the range as the multiyear rate plans kind of come into effect and you kind of execute on this carbon plan. So, I am just curious if you could just update the investment community on if that dynamic still exists as we get to the out years here in the new CAGR? Thank you. Lynn Good : Yes. Nick, thanks for that question. Let me start by saying we believe our regulated business with this clean energy transition, $125 billion of capital over the 10 years has the potential to achieve at the high end of the range. But given the dynamic economic environment that we are in right now, we believe 5% to 7% is the right range to use for the planning assumption and know that we will work every year to be as well positioned within that range as we possibly can. And we have talked about many of those puts and takes, IRA benefits, reducing O&M, all of these things represent opportunities as the plan unfolds and then further this very meaningful regulatory activity that\u2019s underway is another key ingredient. The first all-year rate plan filing for DEP occurred this year. We are expecting another one \u2013 another filing for DEC in the coming year. So, we are putting pieces in place and trying to address the macroeconomic environment at the same time. And we believe all of this given the premier regulating utilities that we offer is a very strong value proposition for investors. Nick Campanella : Thanks for that. And then I just wanted to pivot to renewables quick, acknowledging that you are moving away from the Commercial segment. But as you mentioned, you are doing a ton in the regulated arena. So, just \u2013 maybe just a general state of the state on what you are seeing in the renewable supply chain at this point. I see that you are still kind of executing in Florida with the 300 megawatts that went into service in 2022 as planned, but just general kind of comments on supply chain and ability to kind of get things done in the 5-year window? Thanks. Lynn Good : Nick, thank you for that. And I think as we have talked over the last year with some of the challenges in the supply chain. We have always leaned to our regulatory \u2013 regulated business and make sure we have adequate supply. And we have extended our purchasing relationship with our suppliers to extend on a multiyear period so that we have confidence around supply into \u201826 and beyond with options to continue. We are putting similar arrangements in place for battery storage. So, we are confident in our ability to execute the regulated plan and have just so many opportunities as we pursue this clean energy transition. We are working to make sure we have got the supply chain, the labor, etcetera, and have been successful so far and see that continuing. Nick Campanella : Excellent. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead when you are ready. Lynn Good : Good morning. Durgesh Chopra : Hey. Good morning Lynn. I just had a quick follow-up, hopefully, quick, on the interest expense into 2023. Any color, Brian, that you can share as to what level of rates \u2013 interest rates are you using as we look out to 2023, particularly related to your variable there, so we can kind of do the sensitivity as we look out to the interest rate outlook here? Lynn Good : Durgesh, the sensitivity of 100 basis points, representing about $0.12 is probably the best and cleanest without getting into specific detail on commercial paper and long-term debt, recognizing the tenor can fluctuate. I think that\u2019s a really good proxy for you, and I would point you there. Durgesh Chopra : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. I appreciate it. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We now have Sophie Karp of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Sophie Karp : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So, a couple of questions here, if I may. First, with the sale of renewable business, does that present an opportunity for you to have conversations with rating agencies about reviewing and maybe improving your corporate trading? And what impact could it have on your borrowing costs? Lynn Good : Yes. So, we keep a close relationship with the agencies. And by that, I mean sharing with them all of our plans, what we expect in terms of this transaction, the de-risking of the business. I wouldn\u2019t expect though, given the magnitude of this recently 5% of the business that it would have an impact on downgrade threshold or anything of that sort. But it gives us an opportunity to de-risk. It gives us an opportunity to bring in some cash and all of that is important to the agencies, and we will keep them apprised every step of the way. Sophie Karp : Got it. Thank you. And then on the cost-cutting initiatives you are talking about the total project that you are talking about the relieving [ph] process, especially given the inflationary environment that we are in and how some of your peers are struggling to control costs right now. So, could you just maybe share some, for example, I don\u2019t know about what you are planning to do there. So, we can get a better sense of what the initiatives are with the cost controls, some of those\u2026 Lynn Good : Sure. Yes. And Sophie, I appreciate that. And the one comment I would make is this is where size and scale matters because we have had an opportunity to drive costs through the supply chain as a result of that size and scale that has been helpful. But also a variety of other projects, we have been working on this over the course of the summer looking at work reduction efforts. And Brian, you might have some perspective that you would share on specific examples, maybe some of the reporting, the governance, the digital. Brian Savoy : Yes. Certainly, Sophie and good morning. So, we really took a fresh look at the entire corporation and said, how are we going to get the work done, we need to get done. We prioritized certain roles over others. So, we said some roles had more purpose 5 years ago, and now they need to be repositioned. We looked at our real estate footprint and said, how can we optimize the real estate in this post-COVID world. So, there was an opportunity there to really reduce the amount of corporate real estate we operate. And we just looked at governance across the company and making sure that we maintain our controls, but will run a leaner organization. And it was really a grassroots effort where we got input from all of our teammates to try to figure out what are the best areas to execute on. We have over 200 initiatives. So, it isn\u2019t a one-shot thing. It\u2019s many, many small singles and bunt singles that are going to add up to this $200 million and that we have upsized to $300 million as we have looked at the opportunity set. Lynn Good : Sophie, one example in Brian\u2019s area that I would share, if you look at the amount of reporting that comes out of finance at Duke Energy, there is a lot of it. Not all of it results in decision-making. So, we view this as an opportunity to sweep through what kind of information do we give our operating leaders in order to manage their business. Similarly in IT, lots and lots of applications, right. Do we need all of them. Do we have applications that are only used for a handful of people and can we transfer them. With that, you have got license fees, you have got cybersecurity expense. You have people who maintain those systems. So, it\u2019s things like that where you are just standing back and looking at all those corporate functions, the service levels we are offering and determine is there a way to do it leaner and more efficiently using technology. And as you would expect, when you look every few years, if those things opportunities arise. Sophie Karp : Thank you so much for the color there. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have our next question from the line of Mike Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead when you are ready. Lynn Good : Hi Michael. Mike Lapides : Hey Lynn. Thank you for taking my questions and Brian. I think this is your first earnings call, leading as CFO. Congrats. I may be wrong. I may be getting so on\u2026 Brian Savoy : It is, Michael. Thank you. Lynn Good : Well, everybody remembers their first call, Michael. It\u2019s true. Mike Lapides : I could imagine. They should give out trophies or something like that. Hey, a couple of questions. One, can you remind me \u2013 one is short-term a little bit, Lynn, one is long-term. Can you remind me the cadence and schedule for filing both the North and South Carolina at Duke Energy Carolinas? That\u2019s question one. Question two is kind of think of much longer term, which is many of the stakeholders in North Carolina in the carbon plan have expressed support for offshore wind? And yet if you look at the company\u2019s developing offshore wind in the U.S. You have got one company on the East Coast that\u2019s trying to back out of its PPAs, the signed contracts that they signed less than 1.5 years ago. You have got a large European operator and developer of U.S.-based offshore winds in its earnings call this week that returns and the progress of developing and installing offshore wind is facing headwinds. Can you just kind of talk about your views of some of the \u2013 I don\u2019t know, I will call it offshore wind still a bit of an emerging technology, but just kind of how you are thinking about the risk reward for Duke relative to doing something as significant as that? Lynn Good : Yes. Michael, thank you. And let me \u2013 I will do first rate cases. So, Duke Energy Carolinas, North Carolina will be filed in early 2023. You may recall that the sequence of these things, you host a technical conference to talk about the capital in the multiyear rate plan that occurred this week or last week recently. And then the rate case will follow. We have not yet announced timing or plans for a DEC case in South Carolina. So, more to come on that, and we will keep you updated along the way. Offshore wind is something that we believe is an option over this 2030, 2040, 2050 periods here in the Carolinas. It represents diversity of supply. It is a renewable resource system. But as I say all of that, we also recognize it\u2019s expensive. It has transmission requirements, particularly here in the Carolinas, where you have got to get the power to the load centers that are further west than the coast. And so the approach that we are taking is one of studying and learning more and also allowing the commission and stakeholders and the communities that could be impacted by both the offshore and the onshore transmission to be involved as well. We will not move first and we will not move outside of the regulated business. So, the risk reward for investors and customers has to be appropriate in order for us to move forward. And so I would say we are in evaluation mode. We think it\u2019s an important resource. We think it is important over this clean energy transition, but we are being deliberate and thoughtful and cautious as we move into it. Mike Lapides : Got it. And then last question, just on energy reliability. Just curious how you are thinking about the near-term, meaning next 3 years to 5 years for your coal generation fleet, given the uptick in demand that you and some of your peers in the Southeastern states as well as in the Midwest. And just some of the details like in the Midwest so and elsewhere, that the grid operators and others have put out concerned about near-term reliability constraints. Lynn Good : Michael, it\u2019s a really good question. And what I would say to you is as we contemplated the various scenarios we presented in the carbon plan, as we contemplated the integrated resource plan in Indiana. And in fact, we are updating that integrated resource plan in India to include the new planning assumptions that MISO requires consistent with those reliability concerns. We will not present a plan that does not maintain reliability. And we will not retire assets that are needed to maintain reliability. And so that\u2019s something that is being closely monitored. Our regulators completely understand and support that. And so I think we just have to work our way through it, making sure that we have replacement generation, transmission ready to go. The combination of resources ready to go so that when we retire, our customers can expect reliability. That is our commitment, and that\u2019s the way we are planning and executing these transition plans. Mike Lapides : Got it. Thank you and much appreciate it. Lynn Good : Alright. Thank you, Michael. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to hand it back to Lynn for some final remarks. End of Q&A: Lynn Good : Brica, thank you and thanks to everyone who joined. We will see you in a week. We are pretty confident we will get to do this again, a small room for EEI. So, we look forward to seeing you then. Thanks again for your interest, your questions, and look forward to seeing you soon. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all again for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. Thank you for attending today's Duke Energy Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2022 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Abby Motsinger, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may proceed. Abby Motsinger : Thank you, Joel, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Review and Business Update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair, President and CEO, along with Brian Savoy, Executive Vice President and CFO.  Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information within the meaning of securities laws. Actual results may be different than forward-looking statements, and those factors are outlined herein and disclosed in Duke Energy's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information and disclosures, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.  So with that, I'll turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Abby. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $5.27, closing out a successful 2022. We achieved results solidly within our updated guidance range while making significant progress on our strategic goals, responding to external pressures and delivering constructive outcomes across our jurisdictions. As a result, today, we're reaffirming our 2023 guidance range of $5.55 to $5.75 with a midpoint of $5.65. We're also reaffirming our 5% to 7% growth rate through 2027 off the midpoint of our 2023 range. This reflects the strength of our regulated businesses, our disciplined approach to cost management and a robust $65 billion capital plan that supports our thriving jurisdictions. Before I turn to our regulated utilities, let me provide a brief update on the sale of our Commercial Renewables business. The sales process continues to progress. But as with the sale of any large-scale business, the timing tends to evolve. We remain on track to exit both the utility scale and the distributed energy businesses and now anticipate proceeds in the second half of the year. We will continue to keep you updated along the way. Turning to Slide 5. We've reached a significant milestone in our clean energy transition. On December 30, the North Carolina Utilities Commission issued an order adopting an initial carbon plan. This constructive order is the culmination of years of work with policymakers and stakeholders to chart a responsible path for the energy transition. The order recognizes the value of an all-of-the-above approach to achieving carbon reduction targets in a manner that balances affordability and reliability for customers. The near-term action plan provides approval of 3,100 megawatts of solar and 1,600 megawatts of storage as well as transmission upgrades to support the integration of these renewable resources. The commission also approved limited development activities associated with longer lead time investments, including small modular nuclear reactors, pumped hydro and transmission related to offshore wind. And as part of an orderly transition out of coal by 2035, the commission supported planning for approximately 2,000 megawatts of new natural gas generation to maintain reliability. Through its order, the commission reinforced the importance of maintaining a diverse generation mix while conducting an orderly clean energy transition and was clear that ensuring replacement generation is available and online prior to the retirement of existing coal units is a shared priority.  The carbon plant provides a constructive road map that delivers on our strategic priorities and supports the needs of our customers and communities today and into the future. It supports our capital plan and provides the clarity we need to advance critical near-term investments. We look forward to continuing our progress through our updated carbon plant filing in North Carolina later this year.  Moving to Slide 6. We're making meaningful progress on our strategic initiatives in each of our jurisdictions. In North Carolina, we filed our first performance-based rate application for our Duke Energy Carolinas utility on January 19, which followed a similar filing for our DEP utility last fall. The request includes a multiyear rate plan to fund system improvements to meet the growing needs of our customer base, including $4.7 billion of capital projects that are expected to go into service over the 3-year period. These investments are primarily T&D-related projects that support the security and reliability of the grid as well as approximately $300 million of solar and storage investments consistent with the carbon plan order.  Our request is mitigated by a reduction in operating costs since our last rate case, evidence of our continued ability to manage costs to keep customer rate increases down. Evidentiary hearings are expected to begin in the third quarter and consistent with past practice, we intend to implement temporary rates in September, subject to refund. If approved, we expect year 1 revised rates to be effective by early 2024. In South Carolina, we were very pleased to reach a comprehensive settlement in January with all parties in our Duke Energy Progress rate case. The settlement, which is subject to commission review and approval includes a 9.6% ROE, the continuation of deferrals for grid and coal ash spend and supports accelerated retirement dates for certain coal units. In fact, the settlement is on the commission's agenda for this afternoon. And if approved, new rates are expected to be implemented in April. We also plan to file an updated IRP in South Carolina later this year, which will take into account the carbon plan and the Inflation Reduction Act. Turning to Florida. On January 23, we filed a petition to adjust customer rates for deferred 2022 fuel costs, less the impact of lower forecasted fuel prices in 2023. We are also flowing back IRA tax savings to our Florida customers as of January 1.  In Indiana, we're updating our IRP to reflect results of the 2022 RFP process, regional transmission operator requirements and the Inflation Reduction Act. We expect to begin filing for certificates of need for new power generation in the second quarter. In Ohio, the commission approved in full our electric rate case settlement in December, which supports the recovery of grid investments to improve reliability and service for our customers.  In December, we also filed an electric rate case in Kentucky. The request reflects more than $300 million in investments we've made to strengthen the generation and delivery systems as well as updated retirement dates for our Kentucky fleet. As we advance our regulatory strategy, affordability remains top of mind. Brian will go into more detail on steps we're taking across our jurisdictions to lower costs for customers. Finally, I want to highlight a well-deserved recognition for our Piedmont Natural Gas team. In December, J.D. Power ranked Piedmont #1 in residential customer satisfaction for natural gas service in the Southeast. This is the first time Piedmont has received the #1 ranking and is a testament to the commitment to our customers.  In summary, 2022 was an extraordinary year for Duke Energy as we made strong progress executing our strategy, responding to difficult external pressures and advancing our clean energy transformation. Our path forward remains clear. As we continue to navigate our energy transition, we will do so responsibly, preserving affordability and reliability for our customers and remaining good students -- stewards of communities. I'm confident that our strategy will continue to deliver consistent and lasting benefits to our customers, communities and investors.  With that, let me turn the call over to Brian. Brian Savoy : Thanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. 2022 marked a year of solid growth for our utilities. We achieved full year adjusted earnings per share of $5.27, above the midpoint of our updated guidance range. These adjusted results exclude our Commercial Renewables business, which was moved to discontinued operations in the fourth quarter. The classification of these assets as held for sale triggered a valuation adjustment of $1.3 billion, which is reflected in discontinued operations and GAAP reported results. This adjustment relates to the combined utility scale and distributed generation businesses and was within our planning range for the sales processes.  Moving to our adjusted results for the year. In the Electric segment, earnings per share increased by $0.36 in 2022, primarily due to higher volumes, favorable weather and rate increases in North Carolina and Florida. Partially offsetting these or higher interest expense and storm costs. Absent storms, O&M was flat to prior year, which was in line with our guidance. In the Gas segment, earnings per share increased $0.07 and was primarily due to the Piedmont, North Carolina rate case and riders.  In the Other segment, unfavorable returns on investments and higher interest expense drove results lower by $0.15.  Turning to Slide 8. We are reaffirming our $5.55 to $5.75 guidance range for 2023 with the midpoint of $5.65. Within Electric, we expect retail volume growth in 2023 of roughly 0.5%. We also entered the year with updated rates for Ohio and Florida already in effect and we'll see growth from 3 Carolinas rate cases as we move through the year.  Additionally, we will continue to see growth from the grid investment riders in the Midwest and Florida, namely the Indiana TDISC and Florida SPP plans approved in 2022.  Moving to cost mitigation. We've identified $300 million of savings in 2023, which is primarily related to rationalizing our corporate and business support cost structures. Examples include streamlining IT support and reducing our real estate footprint. These cost reductions will be realized ratably over 2023 with approximately 75% of the savings being sustainable into future years. Partially offsetting these favorable drivers are higher financing cost as well as depreciation and property taxes on a growing asset base.  Within our Gas segment, growth drivers include the Ohio rate case currently underway, cost mitigation efforts and customer growth, partially offset by higher interest expense.  Finally, we expect the Other segment to be unfavorable due to higher interest expense.  Turning to retail electric volumes on Slide 9. In 2022, we saw load growth of 2.5%. These strong results were driven by residential customer growth of 1.8%, higher usage per customer from hybrid and remote work and a continuation of the post-COVID rebound in the commercial class. Our total retail load in 2022 was about 2% higher than 2019 pre-pandemic levels. This is equivalent to an average annual growth rate of around 0.5% when smoothing out the year-to-year fluctuations. In 2023, total retail load growth is projected to be roughly 0.5%. Based on 2022 U.S. Census Bureau data, 3 states within our regulated footprint were in the top 6 for net population migration. This illustrates the robust customer growth experienced in our territories, which we expect to continue in 2023. We expect load growth in the commercial class to moderate this year following 2 years of significant growth. But the upside in industrial as easing supply chain constraints fuel a continued rebound for certain large manufacturers. Longer term, we expect annual load growth to be about 0.5% through 2027.  Turning to Slide 10. I'd like to provide an overview of our 5-year capital plan, which has increased to $65 billion. When compared to prior periods, the capital plan has steadily increased as we move further into the clean energy transition. This increase is net of removing almost $3 billion of commercial renewables capital, including the previous 5-year plan. This means that we've increased the regulated plan by approximately $5 billion, resulting in a 7.1% earnings-based CAGR through 2027.  While the investment needs of our utilities continue to accelerate, customer affordability remains front and center. Affordability has consistently been a pillar that governs our planning, and we have several tools to help keep rates low and assist customers who are struggling to pay their bill. First, the benefits of our cost mitigation efforts go back to customers over time, easing bill impacts as we recover capital investments. As I mentioned, we expect 75% of our 2023 cost mitigation efforts to be sustainable. Additionally, we are targeting flat O&M from 2024 through 2027. Our long-term O&M trajectory is supported by smart capital investments within our plan, including modernized equipment and technology investments that will help reduce fuel and operating costs.  Next, the Inflation Reduction Act provides substantial benefits for carbon-free resources, including nuclear and solar PTCs and other renewable tax credits. We are beginning to incorporate these benefits and updated resources plans and rate adjustments. Over the next decade, we will fully leverage IRA benefits across all of our jurisdictions in order to maintain low cost for customers as we execute our clean energy transition. Finally, assisting vulnerable customers has always been an area of focus. But since the pandemic, we worked even more closely with our communities and customers in need. For example, in 2021, we created a specialized team that partnered with agencies across our service territories and help connect customers to nearly $300 million in energy assistance funding over the 2 years.  Moving to Slide 11. Our ability to execute our robust capital program is underpinned by a healthy balance sheet, and we remain committed to our current credit ratings. In December 2022, we received $1 billion in cash proceeds upon the closing of the second tranche of the Indiana minority stake sale. We expect to receive proceeds from the Commercial Renewables transactions later this year, which will be used for debt avoidance at the holding company.  Turning to FFO to debt. We ended 2022 below our 14% target, largely due to deferred fuel balances. We have started recovering these amounts through established recovery mechanisms and we'll continue to file using mechanisms in place for the remaining balances. As we recover deferred fuel costs over the next 1 to 2 years, we expect FFO to debt to steadily improve and return to our long-term 14% target, demonstrating our commitment to our current credit ratings.  As we look ahead, about 90% of the electric investments in our capital plan are eligible for modern recovery mechanisms, which is critical to maintaining a strong balance sheet, mitigating regulatory lag and smoothing rate impacts. With the steps we've taken to reposition our business and improve our cash flow profile in the years ahead, we are not planning to issue equity through 2027.  Moving to Slide 12. Our robust capital plan, strong customer growth and constructive jurisdictions provide a compelling growth story. And our commitment to the dividend remains unchanged. We understand its importance to our shareholders and 2023 marks the 97th consecutive year of paying a quarterly cash dividend. We intend to keep growing the dividend balancing our targeted 65% to 75% payout ratio with the need to fund our capital. As we begin 2023, we are well positioned to tackle the challenges ahead and look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.  With that, we'll open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : So Lynn, just starting on the Commercial Renewables, it's good to see, obviously, you guys reiterated '23. Obviously, the range assumed midyear cash in the door. Just remind us on the EPS sensitivity per quarter from the delay. And I guess, where does this put you within the '23 range? Lynn Good : Sure, we're continuing to target $5.65 and feel very confident with that. As you can expect, as we entered the year, we had a range of expectations around both timing and proceeds from the sale. And what I see now as being kind of a modest delay from midyear to later in the year, I don't see an impact. I think it's important to recognize that the growth is primarily driven by our regulated outcomes and the cost mitigation that's offsetting some of the external headwinds and those are on track as we expected and shared with you third quarter. So confident in the $5.65. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. And then just a follow-up on -- I know, obviously, the $1.3 billion charge you took for commercial, you're obviously not the only utility that's done this. We had a peer took a charge yesterday. Is there anything to read on the ultimate sale price for the assets? I mean, obviously, we noticed word robust \"fell off \" the slides. I guess how do we take that charge relative to the ultimate sale price? Lynn Good : Shar, I appreciate the question. I also appreciate how closely you all read the slides. We weren't intending to signal anything with the word robust. We feel good about the process. There's strong interest in the portfolio and we're moving forward. I think the thing to recognize on an impairment charge, is this an accounting adjustment that's really driven by the earnings profile of renewables, where a lot of the profit that's in the early part of the life, you then depreciate it over a longer period of time. So when you make a decision to exit before the end of the useful life, you've kind of set yourself up for an impairment. So I would look at it that way.  The takeaway is the strategic decision around asset remains unchanged, and we're on track for proceeds later this year. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Perfect. And then just one quick one for Brian, if it's okay, on the credit side. Obviously, trying to -- the prior plan had a 14% FFO to debt over 5 years. And now you guys kind of stated over the \"long term.\" '23 target is 13% to 14% from obviously the deferred fuel balances and 13% is a downgrade threshold. I guess can you just talk on how the rating agencies are treating these deferred fuel balances? And how you're thinking about future balances? I mean, could another event trigger a downgrade as we're thinking about the balance sheet capacity? Brian Savoy : We'll definitely hit that, Shar, and thanks for the question. We're working through the deferred fuel balances, through the regulatory mechanisms in place. And that's what the agencies are looking for. Looking to see, are you filing in line with the regulatory recovery that is established. Or are you making exceptions spreading that recovery longer. We've had really good success so far in North Carolina and South Carolina, and we have a couple more filings in front of us, both in Florida and Duke Energy Carolinas, North Carolina.  But these are working. The regulators understand our need to recover this in a timely manner from a credit position and the rating agencies are liking what they're seeing in how we're executing these plans in accordance with the tools in place. Lynn Good : And Shar, the only thing I would add to that is we look at this and the agencies look at this as a temporary issue because you can associate it completely with the deferred fuel. And the fact that we have been able to work constructively through recovery mechanisms, and we can actually forecast how that balance is going to decline over '23 into '24, it gives us a lot of confidence on the metrics.  And of course, as you would expect, we're in conversations with the rating agencies every step of the way. This regulated portfolio that we have with the cash flows and constructive jurisdictions is really what underpins the credit ratings of the company, and nothing has changed around that risk profile. Operator : The next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you for the time and a pleasure chat. Just following -- so just with respect to the carbon plan here and obviously, the developments late in the year, you guys had -- you addressed it in part in the comments, but I'm just sort of curious, as you think about addressing some of the follow-up items here through the course of this year. Again, what is the flex in the capital plan? What exactly are you assuming today in some of the updates in the multiyear outlook? And specifically, as we've talked about before, how could the subsequent updates here impact probably more of the '24 outlook as you think about puts and takes in the CapEx budget? What could come out of this next [indiscernible] Lynn Good : Sure. And thanks, Julien, for that. I regard the carbon plan order is a very constructive one that has given us real clarity on the near-term investments. So when you think about 3,100 megawatts of solar, 1,600 megawatts of battery storage, that capital plan is pretty well locked in for the Carolinas. We may see some marginal changes, but I would think about those as later in the 5-year period and really in connection with the next update. So I feel really good about the Carolinas.  Florida is also on track with the 10-year site plan and SPP and grid modernization. I think where we have potential and even potential upside is in Indiana, where we are earlier in the clean energy transition, moving through that process. We have estimates in the capital plan, but we'll be filing for CPCN later this year, and have more advanced dialogue about timing and approach. So I'm very comfortable with the capital plan and if anything, see a bit of upside in Indiana as we continue our clean energy transition. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Actually, since you mentioned it, just to probe a little bit. You said a moment ago, you assume a certain baseline in Indiana already in the latest plan. But as I heard you say a second ago, you're saying that there's more likely than not upside bias within that, but you have assumed something in the Indiana [indiscernible] Lynn Good : Yes. We have an estimate. That's exactly right. We put an estimate in there, Julien, but we're filing an updated IRP later this month into March, then we're filing for CPCNs. So that will crystallize more specifically toward the end of this year into 2024, much in the way that the Carolinas has matured as we go through IRP filings. Now we have an order on the carbon plant. So that's the way I would characterize it. And if anything, I would say our estimate has been on the conservative side. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. Excellent. And then any developments or any thoughts around South Carolina here as you think about the opportunities that may exist there? I know, obviously, carbon plan principally think about North Carolina here. Any crystallization of a further alignment here in South Carolina, if I can call it that at all? Lynn Good : Well, it's a good question, Julien. And I guess I'd like to step back and just point for a moment to a very constructive and comprehensive settlement that we were able to reach on the South Carolina rate case. I think that's an indication of just the incredible work that we have been doing with the stake -- with the stakeholders to continue constructive dialogue about where the company is going and what we're trying to accomplish.  And I appreciate your sensitivity on the word alignment because what we are trying to accomplish is giving both states the flexibility to put their fingerprints on an energy plan going forward. And we believe we're making progress on this. We actually had testimony in the carbon plan that laid out a structure that would allow states to opt in or opt out depending on their energy policy, and that is beginning to take some discussion in South Carolina, but that will progress over time. We believe we operate in an incredibly valuable system, and we'll work with both states on how to add resources to meet their needs, customer and policy needs going forward. Operator : The next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Steven Fleishman : So just a follow-up question on the Commercial Renewables impairment. The -- I think you announced it was for sale in the Q3 call. So is there a reason the impairment was not taken then and is being taken now? Is that because you have more information? Is that something else? Lynn Good : So Steve, we actually made the decision -- final decision to sale in early November and announced it on the third quarter call. So that decision went through a governance process, Board approval, et cetera, in the fourth quarter. And as a result, the impairment goes in the fourth quarter. Steven Fleishman : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And -- but it does sound like the impairment -- the value that you have on now is consistent with the ranges that you've been expecting for the sale process. Lynn Good : That's exactly within our planning range, absolutely. Steven Fleishman : So nothing's really changed in your planning range. Okay. Lynn Good : That's exactly right. Steven Fleishman : My other question is on the rate cases in North Carolina under the new law, the new multiyear rate plan, how are you thinking about whether you'd be able to settle those cases or that they likely need to -- because they are kind of the first under the law and need to go through a full litigated process most likely? Lynn Good : Steve, I think it's too early to tell exactly. And you may -- if you think back on our history, we have, from time to time, entered into partial settlements where you feel like there are elements of this case that can be agreed and then there are others that the parties believe ought to be put in front of the commission. You should know we'll explore discussions with all intervening parties through this process. And as we get closer to dates when testimony gets -- is ready to be heard and testimonies been filed by all the parties, we'll begin those discussions. But it's too early to tell the shape that it will take. Steven Fleishman : I guess one last thing. The $300 million of O&M reductions, I know that's, I think, a number that you've had before, the 75% sustained. Can you just remind me, is that the same that you said before? Or does that number get [indiscernible] Lynn Good : It is, Steve. No, it's the same. It's the same as what we said before. So thank you. Operator : The next question is from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro : Just on that topic of cost management, could you give your latest level of confidence in hitting the $300 million this year, what you're seeing in the backdrop in terms of it becoming more challenging, easing up of any of those inflationary pressures this year so far? Brian Savoy : That's a good question, David. This is Brian. When we looked at the opportunities across the board last year to really position 2023 in a good spot, we identified areas in our corporate costs and business support that we felt like we could really align service levels with work prioritization. And we did this across the board, but a good example is in IT, right? We have about 1,300 IT systems. Well, not all are mission-critical don't need to be -- have the same level of support as others. So we really stratified our support levels. And we did that across IT, HR, legal, finance, we looked at across the corporate areas and found really structural opportunities that will remain for the long term. And that's why we feel like a lot of the 75% of the $300 million is sustainable.  And another area that was also very important to the cost reductions was our real estate footprint. In Uptown Charlotte, we're moving from 4 buildings into 1 new tower. That's reducing service costs on those assets as well as lease cost and depreciation. So inflationary pressures are not impacting our ability to hit that $300 million target. We've contemplated inflation in certain pockets in the portfolio as we look into the spin in 2023 in our planning horizon and feel good about the $5.65 target we have. David Arcaro : Okay. Understood. That's helpful. And then I was wondering if you could just talk to -- what gave you the confidence in knocking up the CapEx plan for the '23 to '27 period. But then also on the rate base outlook, it looked like the 2027 rate base forecast had ticked up a decent amount versus the prior expectations. So I'm wondering if there are any other drivers behind that, too. Lynn Good : David, as we come to capital planning every year, we take into account where we are with regulatory approval, where we are with integrated resource plans, et cetera. And so we have seen an increase in transmission and distribution investment. If you look at the carbon plant in particular, there's transmission that's been approved in order to open up more potential for renewables. And as we get out into '26, '27, those numbers also reflect what we expect to mature in subsequent IRP updates and subsequent regulatory approvals. So that's how I would answer. I don't know, Brian, would you add anything further? Brian Savoy : No, I think as we move deeper into the clean energy transition, we expect the capital plan to increase year after year as well. So this is in line with our expectations as we move through the '20s. Lynn Good : And I think that's an important point. As we were talking -- thinking back to the generation transition day kind of showing those charts about the 10 years. As we get deeper into the plan, more generation investment begins to show up earlier in the plan, more transmission and distribution. So you're beginning to see that and you'll see more of it in '28, '29, '30. Operator : The next question is from the line of Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse. Nicholas Campanella : A lot of good questions so far. So I guess conceptually, Brian, when you updated this plan in the third quarter, we were kind of at the height of inflation, interest costs, gas costs, et cetera. And now we've obviously seen some of those things roll over here since you've given the 5% to 7%. Does that put you in a better spot in the range now, given that dynamic? I'm just thinking long term through the plan here? Any comment that you could give on that? Brian Savoy : Nick, it is a good question around long-term growth rate. And we feel good about our 5% to 7% growth. And we have a lot of things to figure out. I mean interest rates have moderated to some degree, but they're still moving up, right? The Fed is still moving it. Fuel costs have been on the downward trend, and we -- that's really good for our customers. But they could move up just as fast as they did in 2022. So right now, we're sticking to the 5% to 7% growth range and not signaling inside it anymore. Lynn Good : I think the commodity price is coming down, Nick is a real positive for customers because you think about we still have deferred fuel to collect, but our estimates for cost of fuel in 2023 is coming off and that's a good thing. So we're pleased to see that. It's good for customers. It also takes a little pressure off of interest in financing. So we'll continue to take advantage of every bit of that. Nicholas Campanella : I appreciate that. And to your point on the deferred fuel, 80 bps hit to the FFO and the '23 time frame here, and I acknowledge you have a path to get back to the 14% long term. I guess my question is, do you see sufficient headroom in your metrics at this point for unforeseen events like storms? And just how should we kind of think about the ability for the current plan to just handle any more kind of transient credit hits here? Lynn Good : We feel very comfortable. The fact that we've absorbed $4 billion of deferred fuel and $0.5 billion of hurricane in 2022 alone, I think, is a strong testament to where we are, our scale, our ability to manage resources, et cetera. So we feel comfortable with it. We care deeply about maintaining these credit ratings. We think they're important and at the right level for the degree of risk in the business, but this is an opportunity that presents itself with the size and scale of our company where we can manage our way through blips of this type. More than a blip actually, $4 billion. Operator : The next question is from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : I just want to round out the Commercial Renewables conversation a little bit, if I could. If there's any additional color you could provide on the sale such as where book value stands right now, portfolio tax equity position, asset level debt. Just trying to fuse together more on our side. I appreciate that it's a sensitive time given that you're selling the assets, but wondering if you could share any more details, particularly as it relates to book value. Lynn Good : Yes. And Jeremy, let me comment on -- we feel good about the process, strong interest in the portfolio. We're not going to talk any more specifically around valuation. I hope you can appreciate that given where we are in the process. And I don't know, Brian, if you want to add anything to... Brian Savoy : Yes. Jeremy, we referenced a $3 billion book value excluding the tax attributes mid-year and we had some projects we continue to invest in for the balance of the year and then took the $1.3 million write-down at the end of the year. So you can kind of walk it down that way if you want to think about book value. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to kind of pivot a little bit, you involved with a number of emerging technology partnerships, including Honeywell battery, [indiscernible] and TerraPower hydrogen pilot. Just wondering which technology here you're most excited about? And if you were going to move forward 10, 20 years down the road, which one do you think plays a larger part in the Duke portfolio at that time? Lynn Good : Jeremy, it's a really good question. It's a really good question. And one of the reasons we are involved in so many different things is the obstacle for full-scale adoption has a lot to do with which technology can reach commercial scale with a supply chain that will support how much of it we need. I think about our path or climate report through 2050 has us a need of somewhere between 10,000 and 15,000 megawatts of what we call 0 emitting load following resources kind of in that late . So that could be hydrogen. It could be small modular reactors. It could be CCUS, it could be longer duration storage.  So the key being, again, though, we're not going to invest until they're affordable for our customers, and we can invest at the commercial scale necessary to make a difference. The small module reactor is something we're spending time on, and you would expect us to. We are the largest regulated nuclear operator in the U.S. sitting in a part of the world that embraces nuclear as part of the solution. But we also joined with a collection of Southeastern utilities to pursue a hydrogen hub. Because with all that carbon-free generation and all the solar we're going to have in this area, we think that's something worth investing in, really, as part of maintaining and preserving the natural gas infrastructure that has been so important to this region.  So I know it's a roundabout answer to the question, but we're not ready to put our finger on any specific technology as the solution, but we are advancing our work, piloting, advising, working as actively as we can to make sure these technologies are developing at pace so that when we do need them and are ready to invest, there will be something that makes sense for our customers. Operator : The next question is from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Durgesh Chopra : Just all my other questions have been answered. If I may, I just had a quick clarification on the tax leakage portion of the commercial renewables sale, Brian, does -- so the message on the Q3 call was tax leakage is manageable given your other tax losses. I'm thinking about with this write-down, does that impact your sort of tax basis? And are you still saying that -- is the message still that the tax leakage is manageable? Or does that -- does the impairment charge change that dynamic? Brian Savoy : Yes. There's no change to the tax position or a tax basis as a result of this impairment charge, so no change in message. We can manage it. Operator : Thank you. That's all the time we have for questions today. I would like to turn the call back over to Lynn Good for concluding remarks. Lynn Good : Well, thank you all for joining and for your investment in Duke Energy. We appreciate that. We feel like we've had a strong finish to the year and excited about 2023. And as always, we're available, Investor Relations and the senior management team for any further questions. So thanks for joining today. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. Please enjoy the rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello everyone. And welcome to the Duke Energy First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. My name is Nadia and I will co-ordinating the call today. [Operator Instructions]  I would now hand over to your host, Abby Motsinger, VP of Investor Relations to begin. Abby please go ahead. Abby Motsinger : Thank you, Naida. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy's first quarter 2023 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair, President and CEO, along with Brian Savoy, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information within the meaning of securities laws. Actual results may be different than forward-looking statements, and those factors are outlined herein and disclosed in Duke Energy's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information and disclosures, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Abby. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.20 for the first quarter. These results reflect a $0.22 headwind from weather with January and February ranking among the warmest winter months on record across our service territories. In fact, DEP had its warmest January and February in the last 32 years. In response, we've already taken action activating agility measures across the enterprise, which Brian will walk through with you in just a moment. With three quarters remaining, including our strongest quarters still ahead, we are reaffirming our 2023 guidance range of $5.55 to $5.75 with a midpoint of $5.65. We're also on track to deliver our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2027 off the midpoint of the 2023 range. Before I turn to our regulated utilities, I would like to provide an update on the sale of our commercial renewables business. As you know, we have separate sales processes underway for the utility scale business and the distributed energy business. We are in the late stage of the process for both transactions and we'll look to update you in the near future. We continue to anticipate proceeds in the second half of the year. Moving to Slide 5, we're making meaningful progress in our strategic initiatives in each of our jurisdictions. In North Carolina, we recently reached a partial settlement with public staff [indiscernible], who represents DEP's industrial customers and the Duke Energy Progress rate case. With agreement on approximately $3.5 billion of forward-looking capital investments in the multi-year rate plan, the settlement represents a significant milestone on our journey to modernize recovery mechanisms in North Carolina. It positions us well to continue delivering value to customers, while supporting the cash flows of the company. The settlement also provides clarity on retail rate base of approximately $12.2 billion for the historic base case and depreciation rates that largely align with DEP's proposal. Further, we reached agreement on performance incentive metrics and residential decoupling. We were pleased to be able to work with public staff in [indiscernible] to narrow the open items in the case. These settlements are subject to approval by the North Carolina Utilities Commission. Evidentiary hearings began May 4 and are expected to conclude later this month. Interim rates will be implemented in June subject to refund, and we expect permanent rates to be effective October 1. The Duke Energy Carolina's rate case is about three months behind the DEP case and hearings scheduled to begin on August 21. Moving to South Carolina, the commission approved a comprehensive settlement in our Duke Energy progress rate case in February. Revised rates went into effect in April. We also recently received commission approval to securitize approximately $170 million of past storm costs at Duke Energy Progress.  In Florida, the commission approved our fuel capacity and storm cost request in March. Rates were updated in April and reflect recovery of deferred fuel costs over 21 months with a debt return. We\u2019ll recover storm costs associated with hurricanes Ian and Nicole, as well as replenish the storm reserve over 12 months. We also continue to expand our renewable fleet in the study and responsible manner, adding four solar projects in March and April, totalling 300 megawatts. With these additions, we now operate 1200 megawatts of solar in Florida with plans to continuing adding approximately 300 megawatts a year going forward. In Indiana, we've had an active legislative session. The legislature passed several energy bills, including House Bill 1421, which was signed into law and allows quip and rate base for natural gas generation. These bills support our ability to execute our energy transition in Indiana while maintaining reliable and affordable power for customers. We are in the process of finalizing CPCNs, which we expect to begin filing with the Indiana Commission later this quarter. In Ohio, we reached a comprehensive settlement with the PUCO staff and multiple other parties in our natural gas rate case. The settlement, which is subject to commission approval, includes agreement on expanded revenue caps for the Capital Expenditure Program Rider. An evidentiary hearing is scheduled to begin on May 23. And in Kentucky, the commission is conducting an evidentiary hearing today on the electric rate case filed in December. If approved, new rates are anticipated to go into effect in July. We are making great progress on our strategy across our entire service territory, meeting our commitments, and advancing investments in a balanced way to better serve our customers. Our strong track record is reflected in our impact report, Duke Energy's 17th Annual Disclosure on Sustainability Topics. This comprehensive report was published in April and includes our goals and progress on a broad range of topics, including the energy transition. It also outlines our corporate citizenship and the value we're creating for employees, customers, and communities from economic development to environmental justice and to rescaling and redeploying workers. Before I turn the call over to Brian, let me take a moment to talk about our grid investment plan, which is $36 billion accounts for over half of our five-year capital plan. The grid is a critical part of our energy transition and with more than 320,000 line miles. We operate the largest transmission and distribution system in the nation. The foundation of our grid plan is focused on improving reliability and resiliency, preparing the grid for renewables, and enabling electrification. Our reliability and resiliency investments are centered on strengthening the grid against storms and security trusts and improving the ability to rapidly restore power when there's an outage. We're making targeted investments across a variety of programs, including self-optimize growth technologies targeted undergrounding, physical and cybersecurity upgrades, and upgrading lines and substations. Our investments are already making a difference as evidenced by our response to Hurricane Ian last fall, where we restored power in less than half the time of our Hurricane Irma restoration efforts in 2017. As highlighted on the slide, we've made great progress in establishing constructive recovery mechanisms across our jurisdictions. These mechanisms will also assist in recovering growth investments in a timely manner, mitigating lag and supporting balance sheet strength while delivering benefits to our customers. From grid improvements to installing renewables to advancing policy, we're taking collective action to transform and ready the system for the future. We have a clear path forward and are confident our investment plan will deliver sustainable value and 5% to 7% earnings growth. With that, let me turn the call over to Brian. Brian Savoy : Thanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with quarterly results and highlight key variances to the prior year. As shown on Slide 7, our first quarter reported earnings per share were $1.01 and adjusted earnings per share were $1.20. This compares to reported and adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 and $1.29 last year. Adjusted results exclude the impact of commercial renewables, which is reflected in discontinued operations. Within the segments, Electric Utilities & Infrastructure was down $0.14 compared to last year. As Lynn mentioned, these results reflect extremely mild weather in January and February, which drove a $0.22 headwind compared to normal. This is the most significant weather impact we've seen in recent memory. In addition to weather, lower volumes and higher interest expenses were partially offset by lower O&M and growth from rate cases and riders. Rate case impacts in the quarter were primarily driven by our Florida utility. Consistent with our current settlement terms, in January, we had an annual step-up under the multiyear rate plan as well as the impact of a 25 basis point ROE increase as a result of rising interest rates. Moving to Gas Utilities & Infrastructure, results were $0.04 higher year-over-year, primarily due to growth from riders and customer additions. Before discussing retail volumes, I'd like to take a moment to talk about our 2023 cost mitigation efforts and full-year expectations. We're currently executing the $300 million in O&M reductions that we shared previously, which were incorporated into our base plan to address interest rate and inflation headwinds. As we've said, 75% of these savings are structural and will be sustainable into future years. In response to mild weather in Q1, we've already activated agility measures, leveraging our scope and scale to identify further savings opportunities. As we've done in the past, we're looking to tactical O&M efforts and other levers. These include deferring noncritical work, reducing spend on outside services and limiting nonessential travel and over time, among others. We will be thoughtful about these efforts, keeping our unwavering commitment to reliability and customer service at the forefront of our approach. Looking ahead, residential decoupling in North Carolina will be fully implemented by 2024. But until then, we will continue to flex the agility muscle that we have done so successfully in the past. Turning to volumes on Slide 8. As expected, on a rolling 12-month basis, load growth has moderated closer to pre-COVID trends. When comparing to 2022, it's important to note that we had a very robust first quarter last year, which saw nearly 6% growth. In addition, nearly all of the Q1 weakness this year was seen in January and February when weather was extreme. In these situations, it can be challenging to precisely estimate the weather component of total volume variances. In March and April, when weather was closer to normal, volume trends were more consistent with expectations, giving us confidence that the full-year 2023 load growth will be in the neighborhood of 0.5%. Continued strong customer growth in the residential class also supports confidence in our outlook. The population migration we've seen into our service territory remains as strong as ever. In the industrial class, we're seeing some weakness in the textile sector as well as an isolated plant closure by an electronics manufacturer in the Carolinas. Lingering supply chain impacts also continue to be a factor impacting usage. With that said, fundamental growth remains strong. Many of our larger industrial customers are expanding, and economic development in our service territories continues to be robust. For example, our recently released impact report highlighted our final economic development results for 2022. Over the year, we partnered with our states to attract over 29,000 new jobs and $23 billion in capital investments to our service territories. These new customers, which represent several key sectors such as battery, EVs and semiconductors, will provide meaningful load growth as operations ramp up. We\u2019re proud of these accomplishments, which support the communities we serve and give us further confidence in the long-term economic outlook for our service territories. Moving on to financial activities on Slide 9. We had a productive first quarter completing around 60% of our planned 2023 issuances. We\u2019ve also been opportunistic taking advantage of market dynamics, which made convertible notes an attractive option. In April, we issued $1.7 billion of these notes to reduce our commercial paper balance and lower interest expense. Importantly, we made good progress on fuel proceedings during the quarter as well. In Florida, we received approval for a full recovery of the 2022 deferred fuel balance with rates updated April 1. We also filed in February for a recovery of approximately $1 billion of deferred fuel in DEC North Carolina. We expect to receive an order in August and for rates to be implemented in September. Filings over the summer will round out the Carolinas addressing the remaining uncollected costs. In addition, we continue to expect proceeds from the sale of commercial renewables in the second half of this year, which will be used for debt avoidance at the holding company. Combined, we expect these two items fuel collections and the completed sale will positively impact FFO to debt by 50 basis points to 75 basis points by year end. I know the balance sheet is top of mind for investors, and credit is at the forefront of our planning as well. In fact, our efforts and commitment to the balance sheet were recently recognized by Moody\u2019s. In April following their Annual Meeting, Moody\u2019s reaffirmed our current credit ratings and stable outlook at the holding company. This is further evidence that we have the right plan in place and are taking appropriate steps to maintain our strong balance sheet as we advance our energy transition and execute our capital plan. Moving to Slide 12. We remain confident in delivering our 2023 earnings guidance range of $5.55 to $5.75 and growth of 5% to 7% through 2027. We operate in constructive growing jurisdictions and the fundamentals of our business are strong. Our progress on key initiatives in the first quarter positions us well to deliver on our commitments as we execute the priorities that are important to our customers, communities and shareholders. With that, we\u2019ll open the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today goes to Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Shar, please go ahead. Your line is open. Shar Pourreza : Good morning, guys. Lynn Good : Good morning, Shah. Shar Pourreza : Good morning. Just to confirm the short-term cost cut measures, Brian touched on. Those are incremental to the $300 million figure that\u2019s out there. Are any of them potentially structural in nature? And I guess, the key question is, is where do you \u2013 I guess, where do you guys stand within the 2023 EPS guidance range under that normal weather assumption for the rest of the year? Are you still kind of comfortable within the range at this juncture? Lynn Good : The answer to that is yes, Shar and let me talk about the various cost initiatives that are underway. The $300 million that we identified for last year, I would call largely structural. When we talk about 75% of it being achievable, it\u2019s because we\u2019re making fundamental changes and the way we\u2019re completing work, staffing work, prioritizing work, et cetera. When we talk about the actions we\u2019re taking in response to weak weather, I would call those more tactical. This is deferral, this is reducing non-critical work, third-party spend, expenses, those types of things that we have done so many times, as you know. And so the combination of all of these activities as well as the fact we enter any given year expecting a range of outcomes and establishing contingencies that are planning in case something doesn\u2019t work out exactly as planned, we are confident in reaffirming the range of $5.55 to $5.75. And so we\u2019ll continue to update you as the year progresses, but our [indiscernible] reaffirming at this point. Shar Pourreza : Okay, perfect. And then just Lynn, commercial \u2013 obviously the commercial sale being in late stages new language, and you obviously took another $175 million charge. This is obviously the second charge to date. Could we maybe just elaborate why the expectations and the sale have come off more I mean, what\u2019s driving the second revision of capital markets? Is it buyer interest? Just some sense there. And I guess, when can we see something announced? Is it 3Q? Is it closer to year-end? Thanks. Lynn Good : Yes, sure. I appreciate the question. And we are continuing strong progress. We\u2019re in the late stages and expect to be able to provide more information shortly on where we are. Given the fact that we have placed the business into discontinued operations, we continue to evaluate whether we have the right recognition of net book value on the financial statements and did take an additional impairment charge representing further progression of the process. I would say to you, though, that the estimated value that we see in this process remains within our planning assumptions. So there is nothing here that I would point to as a surprise for us as we move through the process. As we have continued the negotiations and marketing is complete, we\u2019re in discussions with select bidders. And we have made a decision to separate the process involving, for example, two projects that we are a minority owner of and concluded that the natural owner is the majority owner based on discussions and negotiations that progressed. So you should look at all of this as a demonstration that we\u2019re nearing the end of the process and we\u2019ll be anxious to announce and give you further feedback as soon as that\u2019s appropriate. Shar Pourreza : Okay, perfect. I appreciate the extra color. Thanks guys. Have a good morning. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question goes to Julien Dumoulin Smith of Bank of America. Julien, please go ahead. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Hey, good morning, team. Thank you guys very much appreciate it. Look\u2026 Lynn Good : Hi, Julien. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Hey, good morning, Lynn. Brian, I wanted to go back to some of your comments, and you specifically said credit is at the forefront of many people\u2019s minds. In the last question, it was brought up about expectations evolving on the renewable sale here. Just want to be crystal clear about this, I mean, especially following the affirmation, barring any changes in CapEx here, which you obviously do in a fairly annual cadence, can you just elaborate a little bit on how you\u2019re thinking about the balance sheet. It seems like you got a target here to get back to 14%. You talked about the 50 basis points to 75 basis points. But very specifically here, your comfort level with the plan and the need to address any further equity or equity-like considerations to expedite getting to that long-term target? Brian Savoy : Thanks, Julien. And it\u2019s the right question, and it is top of mind for us and for investors. Just thinking about what was the pressure we felt in 2022? It was really focused on deferred fuel, right? We under-collected nearly $4 billion of deferred fuel. We also had storm restoration costs of around $0.5 billion. So the balance sheet were $4.5 billion of cost that we didn\u2019t plan for as we moved into 2022. We\u2019re starting to recover that deferred fuel at DEP and Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Carolinas will happen later this year, and we put a chart in the slides to show that balance come off over the next two years. And as we recover those deferred fuel balances, along with the proceeds of commercial renewables, we feel that the balance sheet is where it needs to be the target of 14% FFO to debt is the right target with the right cushion to deal with contingencies that come year in and year out and positions us for no equity through 2027. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Excellent. Thank you for hitting that clearly, and good progress on the fuel. And then separately, Lynn if you can comment here, I mean, obviously a lot of different utility assets moving around, potentially changing hands here. Would love to hear your thoughts more specifically therein as you think about the options. You\u2019ve got obviously a full plate in some respects on a lot of novel angles, especially in the Carolinas here, but can you elaborate at least your latest thinking around perhaps evaluating further assets here? Lynn Good : Julien, I would say our primary focus at Duke is executing what we think is one of the strongest organic growth plans around. As you look at the clean energy transition going on in the Carolinas, Indiana, is beginning transition of generation as well with CPCNs coming yet this year. Florida is continuing to deliver strength with not only solar development, but also grid investment from the storm production plan. So we feel like we've got just a robust capital plan moving forward and strong jurisdictions. So our primary focus is on organic growth. As you note though, assets do become available from time to time. We will look at them if they make sense for us but we'll do so in a disciplined way that maintains a focus on our balance sheet, maintains our focus on growth, maintains a focus on constructive jurisdictions that recognize the right balance between utility health and customer value, and I'll just leave it there. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Excellent. And then if I could clarify earlier, just super quickly, with respect to the Indiana, obviously you've got this IRP out there, I'm just curious, a) if that could change your CapEx entry year, and b) if you have any further thoughts about what that could look like here? Lynn Good : It\u2019s a really good question, Julien, because we have continued to update the IRP in Indiana. Our coal retirement profile remains largely the same, but we are seeing increase in renewables as a result of the IRA, and we're also seeing the impact of Mica's new planning assumptions and how we ought to be addressing that over time. So we are on the verge of CPCN filings that will include both intermittent and non-intermittent resources. We will update the IRP again in 2024 and continue to evaluate whether we're moving at the right pace around the energy transition. I would say as we get into the back part of the decade, there probably is more potential in Indiana around that transition, but we'd like to work through this process to get it started in a way that makes sense for customers in the state. So more to come on Indiana, really pleased with the progress we're making. Julien Dumoulin Smith : Excellent. Thank you guys. Talk soon. Lynn Good : Thank you. Brian Savoy : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question goes to Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Steve, please go head, your line is open. Steve Fleishman : Hey, good morning. Thanks Lynn. Lynn Good : Hi Steve. Steve Fleishman : So just on the North Carolina settlement agreement, is there any other parties in the case? Are they opposed to it or are they are they just not taking a position? Where's kind of other parties if at all? Lynn Good : Yes. Steve, I would say we're really pleased with public staff and the industrials two important parties and the case in Indiana. The Attorney General will be there as well as some of the consumer groups, environmental groups, et cetera. But we feel like the settlement is very strong with public, staff and the industrials. We also have a settlement on the performance incentive mechanisms, allocation and transmission, there're a host of things included. So we believe it's a demonstration of strong progress. We're on the stand starting, I guess May 4th of last week, and feel like we have a very strong case. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Lynn Good : So I can't speak to the other party on what \u2013 on what they may think about what we've put together, but I believe the strength of the settlement public, staff and Sigfois noteworthy. Steve Fleishman : Okay. Good. And then just in terms of thinking about a lot of the issue North Carolina over the years was just dealing with lag and the multi-year plans kind of helped hopefully deal with lag. Obviously ROE cap structures still need to be finalized, but is it fair to say the parts that you agreed upon here are kind of the pieces that would address kind of lag \u2013 regulatory lag in North Carolina in this settlement? Lynn Good : I feel like it's a really key step in that direction, Steve, because for the first time, we have approval of forward capital in a way that gives us some confidence. And the construct of the legislation is such that we have an opportunity to adjust price as that capital is spent in a way that, as you know, is really new and new in the Carolinas and will reduce regulatory lag. So I think starting back with the legislation, we've been making progress towards modernization and now with the settlement have approval of that capital or have a settlement around that capital, of course, commissioned to approve in a way that we feel like we're making strong progress. Steve Fleishman : Okay, great. Thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you. Brian Savoy : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question goes to David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley. David, please go ahead. Your line is open. David Arcaro : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Lynn Good : Hi, David. David Arcaro : Morning. Let's see, I wanted to check in just on the Florida 10-year site plan, I just wanted to confirm whether there could be upside to the CapEx outlook now that you've got in that filed. Lynn Good : Yes, David, I would say we're continuing it with our progress of about 300 megawatts a year. And as we get deeper into the plan, I think we'll consider whether we're moving quickly enough. The multi-year rate plan for Florida runs through 2025 \u2013 2024. The team is signaling me here. So effective 2025 will kind of reset that expectation in Florida, and we'll continue to look at whether we're, delivering the right amount of capital and customer value as we go, always focused on not only continuing to, develop renewables at a pace, but also delivering value to customers along the way. David Arcaro : Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then also just wanted to follow-up on the Carolinas settlement. I was just wondering what your current thoughts are about potentially achieving a settlement at the Duke Energy Carolinas rate case now that you've been successful in getting the partial settlement at progress? Lynn Good : David, I think our posture is always to look for ways to achieve settlement. If you think about the calendar of \u2013 or the procedural calendar of any rate case, typically parties file their positions and then you have an opportunity to sit down and discuss. We will of course pursue that in the DEC case as we did in this one. And we'll keep you updated as the summer progresses. David Arcaro : Okay, great. Thanks very much. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question goes to Bill Appicelli of UBS. Bill, please go ahead. Your line is open. Bill Appicelli : Hi, good morning. Just was wondering if I could get some \u2013 color around the sales. Good morning. Some additional color around the sales trends. I know you commented that when you have the extreme weather, it can distort the weather normalization trends. But maybe just some more color around why you feel, better about the trend you saw in March and April? Lynn Good : Brian, you want to\u2026 Brian Savoy : Definitely take that, Bill. Thanks for the question. And I want to remind you that Q1 of 2022 was a robust quarter. We had 6% year-over-year growth that quarter, strengthen in all sectors. As we were coming out of the COVID rebound, that was the peak point. And so we're comparing to a high watermark and volume trends normalized to our expectations over the course of 2022. And when we looked at this year with extreme weather in January and February, as I mentioned, it's really hard to pinpoint what the, the true weather normalized volumes are in those situations. And when we analyzed March and April results, weather was close to normal in both those months and the volume trends were on track with our expectations for the year. So we do feel like this is bracketed into January and February as far as the weakness and we feel confident that our 0.5% load growth in 2023 and the long-term outlook around a 0.5% is right for us because of the customer growth we're seeing at 1.7% as well as the industrial expansions and economic development activity in our regions. Bill Appicelli : Okay, great. Thank you. And then just one other quick follow-up, on the corporate and other, there was an $0.08 pickup year-over-year. I know you cited some investment gains. Can you just provide some color around that? Brian Savoy : Yes. Bill, we have investments and Benefit Trust\u2019s and other types of investments like that are captive insurer and market returns go up and down. We obviously had a strong first quarter S&P was up around 8% and that was reflected in the market returns in that section. Bill Appicelli : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Brian Savoy : Thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have no further questions. I'll now hand back to Lynn Good, Chair, President and CEO for any closing comments. Lynn Good : Well, thank you and thanks to all of you who joined today and for your interest and investment in Duke. We're available for follow-on questions after this call and look forward to talking soon. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. This now concludes today's call. Thank you so much for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand over to your host, Abby Motsinger, Vice President of Investor Relations to begin. Abby Motsinger : Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy's second quarter 2023 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair, President and CEO, along with Brian Savoy, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information. Actual results may be different from forward-looking statements, due to factors disclosed in today\u2019s materials and in Duke Energy's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Abby, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Today we announced adjusted earnings per share of $0.91 for the quarter. For the second quarter in a row mild weather impacted results. For perspective in the Carolinas January and February were the mildest in the last 30 years. And May and June were in the top five. Through June we're facing a weather headwind of nearly $0.30.  Agility measures have been put in place which add to the $300 million O&M reduction that was targeted and in place coming into 2023. Our cost initiatives are grounded in our culture of safety and serving our customers with excellence while maintaining our assets for the future. Brian will provide more on cost management in a moment.  We've had an early look at July and as you would expect July whether is positive consistent with the trend across the U.S. and August and September are in front of us. With our largest quarter ahead, we are reaffirming our guidance range for 2023 and we'll have more to say on projected results for the year on the third quarter call. As we look ahead, the fundamentals of our business are strong, and we are reaffirming our 5% to 7% growth rate.  Turning to Slide five, you'll see highlights of the strategic portfolio repositioning we've executed over the last decade. With the announcement of the commercial renewable sale which we expect to close by the end of the year, we're a fully regulated company operating in constructive and growing jurisdictions with a wealth of clean energy investments driving growth for years to come. The regulatory constructs in our states have also meaningfully improved over this time, including landmark bipartisan energy legislation passed in North Carolina in 2021. Modern constructs like those in HB951 allow us to invest for the benefit of our customers, while preserving returns for our investors.  We are pleased that today 90% of our electric utility investments are eligible for modern recovery mechanisms that mitigate regulatory lag. Our growth story is an organic one, with over 145 billion of clean energy grid and LDC investments over the next decade. With the portfolio repositioning complete our sole focus is on our regulated businesses, and the work we have underway to pursue the largest energy transition in our industry. Let me now turn to Slide six, to provide an update on our progress in each jurisdiction. In North Carolina, we continue to work toward resolution of the Duke Energy progress rate case. We implemented interim rates June 1, subject to refund, with rates for typical residential customers increasing about 5%. We expect the commission to issue an order later this month for the final DEP rates going into effect October 1.  We're also preparing for the Duke Energy Carolinas hearing which is scheduled to begin August 28. Our energy transition in the Carolinas remains a top strategic priority and we're working diligently on updated resource plans to be filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the North Carolina Utilities Commission respectively in mid-August.  Similar to previous filings, the plans are based on significant stakeholder engagement, and will outline multiple portfolios, each of which preserve affordability and reliability while transitioning to cleaner energy resources. IRA benefits will be incorporated into the analysis for the first time, as well as increasing load from numerous economic development announcements, and continued strong population migration into the Carolinas.  Our modeling will also reflect higher reserve margins as a result of our continuous evaluation of resource adequacy. Later this year, we will begin the CPCN Process in North Carolina for replacement gas generation. At the same time, solar procurement will continue on an annual basis. In fact, our 2022 solar procurement was recently finalized, with nearly 1000 megawatts to be placed in service by 2027. And our 2023 Solar RFP targeting 1400 megawatts was recently approved by the NCUC, with bids to be received later this year.  Following the resource plan filings, each commission will hear from interested parties through a transparent regulatory process as they consider our proposals. We expect an order from the South Carolina Commission in mid \u201824, and an order from the North Carolina Commission by the end of \u201824. Turning to Florida, we're executing us on our investment plan to benefit customers. We've added 300 megawatts of new solar this year and now operate 1200 megawatts in the state, with plans to continue adding about 300 megawatts per year over the next decade. We\u2019re hardening the grid through our storm protection plan and already seeing benefits from improved reliability.  With robust customer growth and timely recovery of investments, our Florida utility continues to deliver strong returns. In Kentucky we've partnered with Amazon to install a two megawatt solar plant on top of their fulfillment center in Northern Kentucky, the largest rooftop solar site in the state. This partnership supports the carbon reduction goals of both Duke Energy and Amazon. And it's just one example of how we're working with our customers to meet their energy needs.  Turning to Indiana, I'd like to take a moment to thank the nearly 2000 crew members that work tirelessly over the July 4 Holiday following multiple storms. The widespread storm systems extended across our entire service territory, and led to a multi-day effort to restore over 370,000 outages.  And in fact today in the Carolinas, our crews are also working to restore outages that resulted from the strong storms in the eastern seaboard and are doing so safely timely, and in close communication with our customers and stakeholders. As with all operations, the safety of our employee\u2019s environment and communities remain front and center and I'm proud to say that for the eighth consecutive year, we've led the industry in safety as measured by total incident case rate.  On the federal side, we're taking advantage of multiple incentives and other opportunities to benefit our customers. We're incorporating IRA tax benefits and resource plans and rate adjustments across our jurisdictions to lower costs for customers and federal funding from the infrastructure investment and Jobs Act creates opportunity to advance new resources and spur economic development.  We have put forward multiple proposals through the IIJA, including for methane reduction, carbon capture long duration storage, hydrogen and grid modernization. And we'll continue to evaluate opportunities as funding is announced. We continue to advocate for federal and state support that recognizes the importance of a responsible energy transition. And in fact, later today, we will file comments on EPAs proposed 111 rule. While we support EPAs commitment to a cleaner energy future. We believe an orderly transition requires a diverse mix of energy resources, and must align with the pace of technology development.  We will continue to actively work with policymakers, industry peers, state partners and others in support of a reliable affordable energy transition. In closing, we've navigated the first half of the year with agility taking swift action in the face of record mild weather while maintaining our focus on our strategic priorities.  With our portfolio repositioning complete we offer an attractive fully regulated organic growth proposition. We have a clear strategy ahead of us as we invest to satisfy increasing demand for clean, affordable and reliable energy across our growing regions. Our long term fundamentals remain as strong as ever, and we're well positioned to deliver sustainable value and 5% to 7% earnings growth over the next five years.  And with that, let me turn the call over to Brian. Brian Savoy : Thanks, Lynn. And good morning, everyone. I'll start with quarterly results and highlight key variances to the prior year.  As shown on Slide seven, we reported a second quarter loss of $0.32 per share, and adjusted earnings of $0.91 per share. This compares to reported and adjusted EPS of $1.14 and $1.09 last year. GAAP reported results include an impairment of approximately $1 billion related to the commercial renewable sale, which is reflected in discontinued operations. Announcing the sale agreements represents a key milestone, and I'm pleased with the progress we've made to-date on this important strategic move.  Within the operating segments, electric utilities and infrastructure was down $0.14 compared to last year driven by $0.16 of unfavorable weather. Absent the weather, we saw growth from rate cases and riders and lower O&M partially offset by lower volumes and higher interest expense.  Moving to gas utilities and infrastructure, results were up a $0.01 due to higher margins and customer growth. And within the other segment, we were $0.05 lower primarily due to higher interest expense partially offset by higher market returns on certain benefit plans.  Turning to Slide eight. Cost management has become part of the Duke Energy DNA, and continues to produce sustainable savings. We're leveraging digital innovation, data analytics and process improvements to increase efficiency, making targeted capital investments to reduce maintenance costs and reshaping our operations to streamline work and lower costs. We've established a proven track record and in 2022, we're an industry leader across key O&M cost efficiency measures. Coming into 2023 we implemented a $300 million cost mitigation initiative to address interest rate and inflation headwinds. These reductions which were incorporated into our base plan are focused on corporate and support areas and remain on track. And as we said 75% of these savings are structural and will be sustainable in the future years.  As Lynn mentioned, we've seen record mild weather in the first half of the year. We\u2019ve taken action to offset these pressures, including launching significant business agility in the first quarter. We're looking to tactical O&M reductions and other levers, including deferring non-critical work, reducing spend on outside services, and limiting non-essential travel and overtime. We expect about $0.20 of mitigation from these measures weighted toward the fourth quarter. We will be thoughtful about these actions keeping our unwavering commitment to safety, reliability and customer service at the forefront of our approach.  Looking ahead, residential decoupling in North Carolina will be fully implemented in 2024. But until then, we will continue to flex the agility muscle that we have done so successfully in the past. Turning to Slide nine, I'll touch on electric volumes and economic trends. Volumes are down 0.6% on a rolling 12-month basis. In the residential class, customer growth remained robust at 1.8% but was offset by lower usage per customer. We believe that this partially driven by energy efficiency and a growing trend of returning to the office. In addition, we continue to see most of the weakness in months when weather was extreme. In these situations, it can be challenging to precisely estimate the weather component of total volume variances.  The long term residential growth trajectory remains strong. In fact, residential volumes have averaged just under 1% growth per year for the past five years, and are 4% above pre pandemic levels. In the commercial class, second quarter volumes are trending above our full year estimate, supported by continued growth in data centers. In the industrial class, planned investment in our territories continues to be robust. Many of our large customers are expanding, and we partnered with our states to attract over 29,000 new jobs and $23 billion in capital investment in 2022. These investments represent several key sectors such as battery, EVs and semiconductors, and we expect they will provide around 2000 megawatts of demand as operations ramp up.  The strength of our service territories was also reflected in CNBCs annual list of America's top states for business, were five of the states we serve ranked in the top 15 and North Carolina ranked number one for the second year in a row. In the near term, we've seen a slight pullback in some of our manufacturing customers due to softening demand in certain sectors of the economy. We're monitoring the impact of macroeconomic trends but the underlying fundamentals, residential customer growth, and commercial and industrial investment continue to support long term growth at roughly 0.5% per year. Moving to slide 10, let me highlight some of the credit supportive actions we've taken to maintain balance sheet strength. We continue to collect deferred fuel balances and filed for recovery of all remaining uncollected 2022 fuel costs. In April, we began recovery of 1.2 billion in Florida over 21 months with a debt return. We also read settlement with the public staff in our DEC North Carolina fuel proceeding and expect to receive an order in the coming weeks.  Per the agreement, we would recover approximately 1 billion of deferred fuel by the end of 2024. Across our jurisdictions, we're on pace to recover 1.7 of deferred fuel costs in 2023. And expect our deferred fuel balance to be back in line with our historical average by the end of 2024. As Lynn mentioned, we expect to complete the sale of our commercial renewables business by the end of the year, and will use proceeds for debt avoidance at the holding company. In addition, about $1.5 billion of commercial renewables debt will come off the balance sheet when the transactions close further supporting metrics.  These actions are credit positive, and we expect to see continued balance sheet improvement into 2024 as we recover the remaining deferred fuel costs and see the full year impact of both North Carolina rate cases. Moving to slide 11. This year marks the 97th consecutive year of paying a quarterly cash dividend and the 17th consecutive annual increase. Looking forward we're executing on our strategic priorities and are excited about the path ahead as a fully regulated company. We operate in constructive growing jurisdictions, which combined with our $65 billion five-year capital plan give us confidence in our 5% to 7% growth rate through 2027. Our attractive dividend yield coupled with long term earnings growth from investments and our regulated utilities, provide a compelling risk adjusted return for shareholders. With that, we'll open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mrs. Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. The line is now open. Shar Pourreza : Hey, guys, good morning. Obviously, it's been a little bit of a slow start to the year, obviously weather driven. You're not alone. You read their guidance, but can you just talk about where you are within the \u201823 range assuming normal weather and how we should think about incremental levers, especially given where you are from an O&M perspective? I mean, clearly, in the slides, you show how efficient you are and you've pulled a lot of levers already. So just curious if you could be a little bit more specific on how much cost mitigation is left for the year especially if weather doesn't transpire? Thanks. Lynn Good : Shar, thanks for the question. No question, it's been a mild weather year and I -- so I look around the industry there are other utilities have experienced a trend similar to ours, Midwest and some in the Southeast. We have put in mitigation plans in place as Brian talked about, Shars, the deferring non-critical work, third-party spend, all of those things that you would expect us to attack tactically in 2023, and we see those progressing. We also are on pace with the $300 million of O&M that we targeted to take out of the business coming into '23. So I look at all of that and the fact that we have the third quarter ahead of us, and we believe the range -- we can reaffirm the range. The range still represents the potential we have for 2023, and we'll update within that range at the end of the third quarter. We did highlight that July, we had a peak of July.  So weather was strong in July, and we've got August, September in front of us. I think what's important to recognize here is that we are working every possible lever, including any contingencies that set in the plan at the time we developed it. And I would just point to the strategic progress also, Shar, that we've made because the fundamentals of this company remain unchanged. Strong capital growth, strong jurisdictions and I think that represents a really solid investment thesis for the future. Shar Pourreza : Got it. And then last one is, obviously, you reiterated the credit metric targets and lack of equity needs through '27 with the current plan. Maybe just a strategy questions here. I guess, how are you sort of thinking about inorganic opportunities? And more importantly, if a deal does present itself, should we assume that the only equity you'd be looking to raise with the amount needed specifically for that acquisition? So should we be concerned around maybe an over-equitizing scenario with a potential deal to further rightsize the balance sheet? Or do you think that's not really necessary given your trajectory and the rating agency conversations you've been having? Lynn Good : There's a lot on that one, Shar. Let me start by saying what I would like you to take away and really investors to take away is that our growth story is an organic one. And I look at all the progress we've made in simplifying the portfolio has brought us to this moment where we're fully regulated with transparent, robust capital that will unfold over the next decade in constructive jurisdictions, growing jurisdictions.  And at the same time, we've also put in place and work through energy policy, modernization of regulations, so that gives us a high degree of confidence that we can execute those plans and deliver returns to investors. And so when I think about growth for Duke, our sole focus is on this organic plan that's in front of us. And so any idea about M&A has to beat what we have in front of us, and it is an increasingly high hurdle because of the confidence we have in our plan. So this notion that we're going to over equitize something to chase an asset and strengthen the balance sheet is just not a narrative that is supported by anything that we're focused on here to do. Operator : We have our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning. Thank you very much. Just wanted to go back to Shar's question on just back half trends, et cetera. Can you elaborate a little bit more on just how you're trending on versus rates? And then also specifically, even quarter-to-date, if you will. July, I mean, it seems like weather may have been pressured again here. Just chiming in a little bit on where we stand even through the summer. Lynn Good : So Julien, let me give a try and Brian may have heard more in that question than I did. So let me start with 2023 financial plan. Before we start considering the impact of mild weather, the plan was always back-end loaded. So if you think about -- we are in the midst of rate cases in our largest jurisdiction.  We put interim rates in new effect of DEP June 1. Full rates will go into effect October 1. The largest jurisdiction, DEC, interim rates will go on September 1. So the plan was always back-end loaded, and I think that's important for you to recognize. And then the mitigation that we've added to that is obviously going to be back-end loaded. You'll begin to see some of it in third quarter, a stronger amount of it in the fourth quarter. And so when I think about July, just consistent with what you saw on the front page of every newspaper, hot, hot, hot, it was hot in our jurisdictions as well. So we had a positive weather story in July. And we'll be monitoring August and September and give you more on where we are in the range after the third quarter. So hopefully, that answered it, Julien. I don't know, Brian, if you have anything to add. Brian Savoy : No, thank you. You got it covered. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay. All right. Excellent. And then just also a further follow-up, I mean obviously, it's an intense amount of focus here just with the willingness to engage or any further thoughts on the willingness to engage in inorganic growth, has that changed at all in the last few months? You've seen the backdrop, right, whether the utility valuations at large, grown, et cetera? Just any further thoughts around that backdrop. Lynn Good : Julien, I would leave you with our sole focus is on organic growth. Sole focus is on organic growth. Because when we look at what we have in front of us and our ability to drive growth with the capital plans that sit in our jurisdictions, we believe that we'll deliver the greatest value to shareholders. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. I think that was quite clear. Thank you very much. Operator : We have our next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. David Arcaro : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks about the FFO to debt range and the target 13% to 14% for this year. I was wondering if you could give a sense of kind of where in that range you're tracking given some of the pressures that you've been experiencing so far? And also just latest thinking on timing for when you can get comfortably above that 14% level? Lynn Good : David, I would say the primary pressure in '23 centers around deferred fuel, and we've given you a sense of how that is tracking. So we're expecting to collect about $1.7 billion of that in '23, which will strengthen the balance sheet. We also have the commercial renewables sale, where we'll see proceeds of about $800 million before the end of the year. That is also credit positive. But as you indicated, weak weather goes the other way. And so stronger weather in July and hopefully a stronger third quarter will be an offset to that. So we feel like the 13% to 14% range remains an appropriate consideration for '23 strengthening into '24. Would you add anything to that, Brian? Brian Savoy : I would say the final lap of the deferred fuel recovery in '24 will move us into that 14% range, coupled with the North Carolina rate cases that are going to be in place in -- for the full year in '24. So those are big catalysts as we look forward. And the IRA benefits will start inuring in larger quantities as we move into the middle part of the decade as well. David Arcaro : Okay. Understood. That's helpful. And then secondarily, with interest rates rising again, I'm wondering if that's representing an incremental headwind to your plan? Just how you're managing that exposure on some of your short-term debt outstanding and also refinancing\u2019s and new debt issuances as they come up. Lynn Good : Yes, David, you're rightly focused on that as are we. Interest rates higher for longer, weakness here with mild weather. So we are working through that, using all the tools you would expect us to use to [indiscernible] up the interest expense, but also looking at the levers we have within our financial plan to offset that as well. So it represents something that gets a great deal of attention, and we're working our way through it. And I would again note that we're reaffirming our guidance range for '23 and continue to believe we can grow at 5% to 7% over the long term based on the fundamentals in the business. And as we move through these rate cases, I would just also emphasize that interest rates are being reset as we go through rate cases and that's an important consideration, as you know. David Arcaro : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : We have our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Jeremy, your line is now open. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Just wanted to come back to the drivers to this year, if I could. And as you noted, weather, inflationary pressure, higher interest rates, all represent headwinds, but I wanted to go to the load a little bit more. At the beginning of the year, you assumed 12-month retail load growth would be about 0.5%. I think in weather normal retail growth right now is down 2.7% year-to-date, and you expect to H2 '23 low growth to be flat to 0.5%. So just wondering for -- what trends you're seeing in load that are different than expectations? Do you expect those to correct over time? And just any color that you could provide there would be helpful. Lynn Good : Yes. Jeremy, let me give a start and I know Brian will have something to add to this. As we look at the various classes, residential load is below our expectation for the year. But I would say to you as we look at residential load, it has been weak in the months when weather has been mild. So I actually believe we've got some in precision. We've talked about this. It's hard to figure out what's the economy and what's weather. And so we're talking about $0.30 of weather headwind, but that could be a bit higher in that some of the volume weakness in residential is weather related. Commercial has exceeded our expectations. And so Commercial is tracking exactly as we would expect. And then industrial, we've seen some pullback. We've seen pullback in a couple of sectors. But fundamentally, over the long term, because of all the growth we're seeing in our industrial and commercial sectors, we think the fundamentals there are strong. So residential, a little bit of a weather story. Commercial on track. Industrial, a short-term pullback is what I would leave you with. And Brian, how would you add to that? Brian Savoy : Yes, I would say in the industrial sector, Jeremy that we're in regular dialogue with our large customers. We talk to them. We understand that with the uncertain economic backdrop, there's some prudent inventory management going on. We've gotten through a lot of the supply chain challenges over the past several years and inventory levels are in a healthier spot. So they're like, well, as we're -- looking forward, there could be some clouds coming. So let's just be prudent. So we've seen a slight dial down in usage, but we don't see that persisting into the long term in the future. So I would just take it at that. And the bottom line is that the economic development investment in our territories is strong, and it's going to produce increasing levels of demand for large customers as we look through the middle of the 20s and into the 30s. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's very helpful there. And then just kind of coming back to prior questions and bringing a finer point to it. There's been media stories talking about Duke's interest and PSNC. And so based on what you're saying before, Duke is not interested in PSNC? Or would that fit into your organic growth story? Lynn Good : Jeremy, I don't think it's appropriate for me to comment on another company's process. But what I would like to emphasize and have you take away is that our sole focus at Duke is on our organic growth plan. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Steve, your line is now open. Steve Fleishman : Thanks. I think my main question was answered there. But one other one, just on the North Carolina in terms of the DEC case. When might we -- if you're going to be able to settle that one, what will be the time line for a potential settlement there? Lynn Good : Yes, Steve, we're scheduled to be on the stand August 28. Rebuttal testimony was filed at the end of last week. So this is the time frame for discussions. And also in that time frame, we're expecting an order on the DEP case. So a lot of activity here in August, and we'll keep you informed every step of the way. Steve Fleishman : Great. Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions on the line. I will now hand back to Lynn Good for closing remarks. Lynn Good : Very good. Well, thank you all for your questions today, you're interested in Duke. We'll have a chance to talk with many of you after the call and even visit some of you. We have an active August in front of us, and we'll be anxious to share with you not only the results of the rate case, but we have important integrated resource plans being filed this month that, again, we'll confirm and underpin the investment thesis here at Duke. So I appreciate your interest in the company and look forward to talking soon. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect the lines.",

My name is Matt, and I'll be your moderator for today's call. All lines being muted during the presentation portion of the call upon opportunity for questions and answers at the end. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Abby Motsinger, Vice President of Investor Relations. Abby, please go ahead. Abby Motsinger : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy's third quarter 2023 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair, President and CEO; along with Brian Savoy, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information. Actual results may differ from forward-looking statements due to factors disclosed in today's materials and in Duke Energy's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Abby, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced strong results for the third quarter, adjusted earnings per share of $1.94 compared to $1.78 for last year. During the quarter, we also made great progress on regulatory outcomes and simplification of the business. This momentum is underpinned by our strong fundamentals. We have a track record of operational excellence and serve growing jurisdictions with a long runway of investment opportunities. This positions us well for the future and gives us confidence in reaffirming our long-term earnings growth rate of 5% to 7%. For 2023, we continue to work on cost structure to offset mild weather and weaker industrial volumes. Brian will talk more about load and cost agility efforts, but I want to take a moment to recognize the incredible work across the organization to mitigate pressures in 2023. Across the Company, agility measures, savings opportunities and efficiency improvements are well underway, while never compromising on our commitment to safety and customers. We expect to finish the year within our guidance range trending to the lower half of the range. Moving to Slide 5. Let me spend a moment on the meaningful progress we've made in North Carolina. In August, the North Carolina Utilities Commission approved our Duke Energy Progress rate case application and related settlements. This order is the culmination of years of work with stakeholders and represents a significant milestone, the first implementation of performance-based regulation, including multiyear rate plans authorized by HB951. The order approved a retail rate base of $12.2 billion, a $1.6 billion increase from our last case, along with roughly $3.5 billion in future capital investments in the multiyear rate plan. Importantly, the order also recognized the rising cost of capital increasing the allowed ROE to 9.8% and the equity component of the capital structure to 53%. This outcome positions us well to continue delivering value to customers while supporting the cash flows of the Company. New rates and residential decoupling were implemented on October 1. Turning to the Duke Energy Carolinas rate case, in late August, we reached a partial settlement with the public staff on many aspects of the case. The settlement provides clarity on retail rate base of approximately $19.5 billion, a $2.6 billion increase from our last case and includes nearly $4.6 billion of capital investments in the multiyear rate plan. A second settlement with the public staff further narrowed the open items in the case and also addressed nuclear PTCs, which Brian will provide more detail on in a moment. We expect the NCUC to issue its decision by the end of the year and expect permanent rates to be in effect by January 2024. We're pleased with the constructive outcome at DEP and look forward to finalizing the DEC rate case in the coming weeks. North Carolina is our largest jurisdiction so constructive outcomes are critical to supporting a strong balance sheet and de-risking our five-year plan. Turning to Slide 6, I'd like to highlight our updated Carolinas resource plan, which is driving material growth and capital investment opportunities as we lead the nation's largest energy transition. In mid-August, we filed our updated resource plan with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the North Carolina Utilities Commission. The single unified resource plan for the Carolinas is designed to meet the needs of this growing region, spurred by rapid population growth and significant economic development activity. The plan maintains an all of the above strategy with a diverse deployment of additional resources, including renewables, battery storage, and natural gas as well as energy efficiency and demand side management. It also provides the opportunity to evaluate emerging technologies, pursue an early site permit for advanced nuclear and early development activities for expanded pumped storage hydro at Bad Creek. The filing included details about our annual solar procurement, which targets over a gigawatt of new solar each year beginning in 2027. It also outlines plans to build additional natural gas generation to maintain reliability and affordability as coal plants are retired. Since the resource plan filing, we filed pre-CPCNs with NCUC, for a combined cycle plant on September 1 and combustion turbines on November 1. We will make our full CPCN filings in the first quarter of 2024. Similar to previous filings, the Carolinas resource plan is based on significant stakeholder engagement and outlines multiple portfolios, each of which preserve affordability and reliability while transitioning to cleaner energy resources. Next steps will include hearings in both states in the spring of 2024. We expect an order in South Carolina in mid-'24 and an order in North Carolina by the end of '24. Turning to Slide 7. With the closing of the commercial renewables sale last month, our portfolio repositioning is complete. We are now a fully regulated company, operating in some of the fastest-growing and most attractive jurisdictions across the U.S. I just mentioned some of our progress in North Carolina and our other utilities continue to deliver as well. At Piedmont, we recently received South Carolina Commission approval of our settlement in our RSA proceeding. We also received approval of our settlement in our ARM proceeding in Tennessee. These annual rate updates allow for efficient recovery of investments as we continue to modernize our natural gas system. And at DEC South Carolina, we've made significant investments since our last rate case in 2019 and are evaluating the timing of our next rate case application. These investments have strengthened the grid against storms, reduced outage times and maintained a high level of reliable service our customers expect. In Florida, we're seeing some of the fastest customer growth in the state and have efficient recovery mechanisms for our grid and solar investments. Our response to Hurricane Idalia in September, yet again demonstrated the value of our grid-hardening investments. The storm caused over 200,000 outages, and we restored power to 95% of customers within 36 hours. Further, our investment in self-healing grid technologies saved more than 7 million outage minutes for customers. Shifting to the Midwest, in October, the Kentucky Public Service Commission approved the new rates in our electric rate case, which utilized a forecasted test year. And the commission approved a 9.75% ROE, a 50 basis point increase from the previous case as well as increasing the equity component of the capital structure to 52%. Across our footprint, we've built considerable momentum over the last year, and our long-term organic growth strategy has never been more clear. This past year has made our company stronger and more agile as we've responded to macroeconomic headwinds. I'm confident we're well positioned to deliver sustainable value and 5% to 7% earnings growth over the next five years. And with that, let me turn the call to Brian. Brian Savoy : Thanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a discussion on quarterly results. As shown on Slide 8, our third quarter reported earnings per share were $1.59, and our adjusted earnings per share were $1.94. This compares to reported and adjusted earnings per share of $1.81 and $1.78 last year. Please see the non-GAAP reconciliation in today's materials for additional details. Within the operating segments, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure results were down $0.01 per share compared to last year. We experienced earnings growth from rate cases and riders, favorable weather and lower O&M from our cost mitigation initiatives, which I will discuss further in a moment. These positive items were offset by lower weather-normalized volumes, higher storm costs and higher interest expense. Shifting to Gas Utilities and Infrastructure, results were up $0.01 due to riders and customer growth. And within the Other segment, we were up $0.16 over the prior year, primarily due to a lower effective tax rate which reflects the ongoing tax efficiency efforts in the Company. We expect our full year 2023 effective tax rate to be at the low end of our 11% to 13% guidance range. As Lynn mentioned, we are tightening our full year 2023 guidance range to $5.55 to $5.65. We entered the year with one of the mildest winters on record. And although weather improved in the third quarter, we remain $0.20 below normal. We also continued to see weakness in volumes estimated at approximately $0.20 year-to-date, some of which may be attributable to weather, but also to a softening of industrial load and return to work for residential customers. To mitigate the impact, we have increased our 2023 agility target to $0.30, which includes tactical O&M savings a lower effective tax rate and other levers. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect a strong finish to the year, targeting $1.50 to $1.60 per share. Our original plan was back-end loaded due to growth from rate cases and riders. We will also see the benefit of our ongoing cost management efforts. We are closely monitoring volume trends and have included fourth quarter drivers in the appendix. Turning to Slide 9. Let me discuss more specifics on volume trends. Volumes are down 1.2% on a rolling 12-month basis. Many of our industrial customers are acknowledging a near-term pullback, managing inventory levels and cost in a disciplined way due to uncertainty in the broader economy. Most are describing the pullback is temporary, and there is optimism about a turnaround in mid- to late 2024 and into 2025. We continue to see strong customer growth from population migration and robust economic development, giving us confidence in growth over the long term. Based on recent success in economic development efforts in key sectors such as battery, EVs, semiconductors and data centers, we see meaningful load growth over the next several years as outlined on Slide 9. For example, in 2024, we expect economic development projects coming online will add between 1,000 and 2,000 gigawatt hours. As we look further out, we have line of sight to 7,000 to 9,000 gigawatt hours by the end of 2027, giving us confidence in our 0.5 to 1% growth rate. Turning to Slide 10. Let me spend a few minutes on 2024. Consistent with historical practice, we will provide 2024 earnings guidance and our detailed capital and financing plans in our February update. Today, we have provided growth drivers for 2024. We've executed an active regulatory calendar this year that has yielded constructive outcomes as we head into next year. The multiyear rate plan in DEP will be in effect for a full year and we expect permanent rates under the DEC multiyear rate plan to be effective in January. In Florida, we will see the impact of the third year of our multiyear rate plan and growth from storm protection plan investments. In the Midwest, we'll see the impact of our Kentucky rate case and grid riders in Indiana and Ohio. In the gas segment, we will see robust growth from rate cases, integrity management investments and customer additions. From a load perspective, we project a pickup in 2024 from return to normal weather. Additionally, while we continue to closely monitor customer usage trends, we expect higher weather-normalized volumes driven by economic development activity and residential customer growth. Recall, residential decoupling will be in place in 2024 in North Carolina. So both DEC and DEP revenue growth will be based on customer increases, which have been robust. We expect interest rates to be higher for longer, resulting in increased financing cost in 2024. For O&M, we have aggressive efforts underway to sustain all cost savings identified in 2022 for 2023 as well as about half of the agility efforts we identified during the course of 2023 to mitigate weather and volumes. As we continue to pursue a technology-enabled, best-in-class cost structure, we expect our culture of continuous improvement to drive 2024 O&M to be lower than 2023 and significantly below our spending level in 2022. Moving to Slide 11. Let me highlight some of the credit supportive actions we've taken to maintain balance sheet strength. We continue to collect deferred fuel balances and have filed for recovery of all remaining uncollected 2022 fuel costs with about 90% approved and in rates. We're on pace to recover $1.7 billion of deferred fuel costs in 2023 and expect our deferred fuel balance to be back in line with our historical average by the end of 2024. As Lynn mentioned, we completed the sale of our commercial renewables business in October. With that, about $1.5 billion of commercial renewable debt will come off the balance sheet, further supporting our credit metrics. In August, as part of our ongoing DEC North Carolina rate case, we reached a settlement with public staff on the treatment of nuclear PTCs related to the Inflation Reduction Act. The settlement provides for the flowback of annual PTCs to customers over a four-year amortization period. If approved by the commission, this settlement would provide savings for customers and be supportive to our credit metrics. We intend to utilize the transferability provisions of the IRA and have engaged an external advisor to run a formal auction-style process, providing access to a broad range of qualified buyers. With these positive developments, we are targeting FFO to debt between 13% and 14% in 2023 and 14% in 2024 through 2027. Finally, as I mentioned, we will provide an update in February on our financing plan, along with a comprehensive refresh and roll forward of our five-year capital plan. We expect our capital plan to increase as we move further into the energy transition. We will take a balanced approach to funding the incremental capital, supporting our growth rate and balance sheet strength. As part of this balanced approach, we will evaluate modest funding through our dividend reinvestment plan and at the market program. The growth potential in our business is at a level we haven't seen in decades. For customers, we will achieve the right balance of affordability, reliability and increasing clean energy. And for investors, we will achieve growth while maintaining balance sheet strength. Moving to Slide 12, we're executing on our priorities and are excited about the path ahead as a fully regulated company. We operate in constructive growing jurisdictions, which combined with our $65 billion five-year capital plan, strong operations and cost efficiency capabilities give us confidence in our 5% to 7% growth rate through 2027. Our attractive dividend yield, coupled with long-term earnings growth from investments in our regulated utilities, provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for shareholders. With that, we'll open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Shahriar Pourreza : I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you'll be obviously updating the capital plan in February, as you always do. And directionally, you're talking some upside bias with CapEx, but maybe you can help at least frame the potential magnitude. So, is it kind of supportive of the 5% to 7% or more potentially better? And where you see the increases coming from? So sort of the various buckets in which states as we think about CapEx upside? Lynn Good : Sure. And Shar, the capital is really underpinned by the integrated resource plans that we have filed. And so, if you look at the Carolinas alone, the filing that we made in August compared to where we were in 2022, we see load growth and we also see the need to raise the reserve margin as a result of all of the growth going on in this region and the winter peaking nature. And so, if you look across all of the types of megawatts from solar to battery, natural gas, et cetera, you see an increase there, and that will become reflected more fully in our capital plan, of course, working through that process with the commission in '24, but we see a need for additional megawatts in the Carolinas really driven in large measure by population growth, economic development and reserve margin. We're also moving deeper into generation transition in Indiana. So as we have filed integrated resource plans and we've accelerated our thinking around the timing of coal retirements, we see natural gas coming into the picture in Indiana as well as renewables. And so, CPCNs will be filed in the next several months, really setting the cadence for Indiana. And then I think you know on our regular schedule in Florida, we will be updating the multi-rate plan effective 1/1/25 and so expectations for capital spending there will be updated. And then the gas business continues to see not only extraordinary growth for a number of customers, but integrity management continues as capital. So, we are in an extraordinary period of growth in all of our jurisdictions. It's transparent. It's filed with our commissions in the form of integrated resource plans on the electric side and clear on the gas side as well. So, we're anxious to provide that update to you in February and have a chance to talk further about it at that point. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. And then, obviously, you highlighted that the current base plan assumes no equity through '27, which is consistent. But you're obviously leaving it open for potential equity to fund spending above the current base plan. As we think about sort of your balance sheet capacity, should we be assuming that every dollar of incremental CapEx is funded with a balanced cap structure, so 50-50 debt equity? Or is that too simplistic and we should be also factoring other sources of equity funding above straight equity? So just, I guess, help us bridge \"balanced approach\" with balance sheet strength. Lynn Good : And Shar, I would think about balanced approach kind of in the 30% to 50% range. And when I think about equity, we've talked about shareholder-friendly equity. You have seen us accomplish that with our transaction in Indiana. I don't know how much potential exists for that given present cost of capital, but we would, of course, explore that and then evaluating the role of dividend reinvestment and at-the-market programs as well. I would also say that the other couple of things that we're watching, we have yet to finalize the DEC case. So, we'll have more visibility on that in December. And then waiting for treasury guidance on these nuclear PTCs and the transferability market, those are also very consequential from cash flow standpoint. So, I feel like we have just a number of levers available to us, and we will exercise them in a way that maintains our growth rate, but also underpins the strength of the balance sheet. Operator : Next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Just coming back at the same direction as Shar here, just in terms of balance sheet, obviously, has been a source of continued conversation as illustrated by the first couple of questions here. How do you think about maybe shoring up the balance sheet incrementally in addition to funding these incremental upside here? I just want to make sure that we're clear about how you think about that piece of it, right? Obviously, coming into a position of strength here with the rate case resolution that you already -- or resolutions that you alluded to by 4Q here, but how do you think about kind of getting to that next step where perhaps conversation's a little less focused therein. Lynn Good : Yes, Julien, thanks for that. And I as we lay out what we laid out today, I think you're watching us strengthen the balance sheet, $1.7 of deferred fuel to be collected in '23, another $1.7 billion of deferred fuel to be collected in '24. And the multiyear rate plans, which have not only given us an opportunity to reset rate base from historic spending but also prepare and put into effect rates for future, I think those will be credit positive. The transferability that I mentioned on IRA will be credit positive. And so, as we bring to you a financing plan and think about the future and the continued growth that we see from capital investment, we will be targeting a minimum of 14% as we go forward and feel like we have the tools to accomplish that. Operator : The next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Steve Fleishman : Just so, the -- you mentioned a couple of times the monitoring the sales trends and I know you gave a little bit of color on the return to work. And could you just talk a little bit more -- in more depth on what's going on with sales in your territories and some of the recent weakness? Lynn Good : Sure. And Steve, I'll give it a start, and then I know Brian will have something to add to it. So we've seen some weakness in '23. And I think you saw us early in the year trying to figure out do we have volume weakness or is it weather because we had such extraordinarily weak weather in the first and second quarter. But the weakness has continued into the third quarter. I would mention textiles. I would mention paper as two industries that have been impacted. And then outside of those industries, we're hearing from our customers, supply chain, labor, interest rates being an impact to them that they're adjusting to. They also -- many of them have inventory they're working through, so they've dialed back production. And production, of course, hits us in terms of lower volumes. But I would say there's optimism in that same industrial group about a rebound later in '24 and into '25. And what I would further say is, we have evaluated this. Residential, of course, return to work, but we think we're probably where that return to work trend is situated. Meaning no more impact from return to work, I think we've pretty well worked ourselves through that transition. And then for our largest jurisdiction, we go to a decoupled environment in 2024, and customer growth continues to be very strong and it's customer growth that will drive revenue. And then on the industrial side, the rebound is positive on existing customers, but this economic development has been extraordinary. And we've given you a sense of what that can look like. It starts to layer in as early as '24. And so that gives us some confidence around our longer-term growth rate that we've got customers sort of working through the macro trends here in the short term. But over the long term, we continue to see this economic development being incredibly strong. And I'm sure you saw yesterday in the Journal, that Toyota battery plant is expanding further, also sitting here in the North Carolina territory. So that's what I would share. And Brian, what would you add? Brian Savoy : I would add, Steve, North Carolina residential has contributed a significant amount to the weakness this year, over half. So going to decoupling is something we need to really emphasize, it's going to mitigate risk and volatility going forward. And our Florida jurisdiction has seen strong growth in the residential space. It's been a hot year in Florida, but we've also had strong population migration, strongest in the state of Florida. So, we see positive shoots coming out, and we do see this industrial load in the Carolinas turning as we talk to customers kind of mid to late next year. Steve Fleishman : Great. That's helpful. One other separate question. Just on when you're doing your plan and your growth rate from the standpoint of interest rates, are you generally just kind of using whatever the forward curve is of rates for what -- for financings or refinancings and the like? Lynn Good : We are generally -- yes, absolutely, absolutely. And as you know, that's a dynamic area. So we look at a range, a range of outcomes. We did that in '23, we'll do it again in '24. And as we talked about all of the work we're doing on cost structure, our objective is to offset the impact of interest rates in 2024. Operator : The next question is from the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays. Your line is now open. Nick Campanella : I just wanted to ask, there's been some pretty significant changes in the Carolinas in terms of just rate structure with these NYRP and I know that you're a little lower in the range for fiscal '23, but could you just help frame EPS volatility '23 versus '24? And the residential decoupling just stands out to us, if you could just frame how that informs your confidence to hit the 5% to 7% implied EPS growth for '24 specifically? Lynn Good : So Nick, I would confirm that it does underpin our confidence in 5% to 7% growth. This modernized construct in the Carolinas is consequential. It's kind of a first in the history of the utility that we will have multiyear rate plans, the ability to set price as we go forward, of course, delivering value to customers every step of the way, but also more closely matching the expenditure of capital with return. And I would add to that, our confidence in the capital underpinning that 5% to 7% growth, very transparent, integrated resource plans, the outline what it's going to be necessary to serve this growing state. So the Carolinas are very well positioned for the future. And as Brian mentioned a moment ago, continue to see extraordinary growth in Florida. And we have strong capital in Florida and grid and solar will be updating our multiyear rate plan, and our investment in the Midwest continues well along both generation and grid in Ohio, for example. So, I feel like we've got all of the elements to underpin our confidence in the growth and the jurisdictions are constructive jurisdictions that find the right balance between benefits to customers and investors, and we're confident in the future. Nick Campanella : Okay. Great. And what about just on O&M, I know in slides where you kind of talked about 50% sustainable after '23. But just looking back to prior calls, I think we've kind of talked about 75%. So just maybe that's just different buckets and I'm mischaracterizing it, but could you help reconcile that view? And then how do you just think about '24? Lynn Good : Yes. And Nick, I really appreciate that question because we have two different $300 million that I think as I look at some of the commentary has been confusing to you all. So let me step through it for you. You may recall that we entered '23 with a cost initiative identified at driving out $300 million of cost, primarily in the corporate center. And we said to you at that time we thought 75% of that $300 million would be sustainable. We have executed on that throughout 2023 and have been confident that the 75% is going to 100% that we'll be able to sustain all of it into 2024. And then further, we have developed mitigation plans based on weak weather and volume in 2023, which is including not only O&M, but other levers, including tax ideas, those total $300 million as well. And we think 50% of those are sustainable into 2024. And we also highlighted on our drivers schedule that we will continue to look for cost savings ideas, part of the continuous improvement structure. That's what we're talking about on Slide 10. So, we believe we have various elements in place to continue to drive O&M lower. We think '24 will be lower than '23, and that's just part of our conviction to continue to drive productivity and efficiency in our operations. Operator : The next question is from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Your line is now open. Durgesh Chopra : All my questions have been answered. I just had a -- all my questions have been answered. Just a quick clarification, Lynn, I think in response to the first question, you mentioned 30% to 50%. I believe you were referring to the equity content of any incremental CapEx. Could you just clarify if that -- if my understanding is correct there? Lynn Good : That's correct, Durgesh. It was in response to what does balanced mean. And so that's the range to think about. And of course, we'll bring a concrete financing plan and capital plan in February that will lay this out more clearly. But as we think about all of the tools and levers and cash flow opportunities that we have across all of our business, that is the range I would consider for incremental equity matched with incremental capital for growth. Operator : Next question is from the line of Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. John Miller : You've got John Miller on for Carly. Maybe just to start with the North Carolina resource plan, just curious if there's any areas where you expect, if any, to get some pushback? Obviously, a healthy chunk of renewables in there with the wind and solar, but also a share of natural gas as well. So curious if you're expecting the focus on reliability with that to outweigh any ESG concerns with the natural gas? Lynn Good : John, I appreciate that question. And I'd start by saying these integrated resource plans are informed by a very robust stakeholder process. And as you imagine pulling stakeholders together, there are different points of view across the spectrum from renewables to batteries to natural gas to nuclear some pro, some con. But we believe what we've put forward is a very balanced all of the above strategy that provides the right balance between reliability, affordability and increasingly clean, which is our commitment to the state. So, we think all of those elements will be closely reviewed and evaluated as part of the process in front of the commission. And we believe we'll work through this in a very constructive way, consistent with the way we've moved forward in the previous plans, and we'll keep you posted every step of the way. John Miller : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just one follow-up to the O&M discussion. I know that of the business agility savings will come in 4Q, but as we are now in the year at November. Just curious if you have any indications of where you're trending towards that target of 50% being sustainable. Lynn Good : We're going to make 50% sustainable. Brian Savoy : That's right. Yes. We're there, John. We have line of sight to the Q4 efforts because a lot of it was tied to the fall outage season as well as just a culmination of work that takes a couple of months to implement, and we've evaluated the ability to keep those going on for 2024 and beyond, and we've confirmed that. Operator : Thank you for your question. There are no additional questions waiting at this time. So, I'll pass the call back to Lynn Good for any closing remarks. Lynn Good : Well, thank you all. Appreciate your engagement today investment at Duke, and we're looking forward to seeing all of you at EEI. So, we'll continue the conversation then. And of course, IR and Brian and I are always available. So thanks so much. Operator : That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello all, and welcome to the Duke Energy Fourth Quarter and End Year 2023 Earnings Call. My name is Lydia, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I'll now hand you over to Abby Motsinger, Vice President of Investor Relations to begin. Abby Motsinger : Thank you, Lydia, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Review and Business Update. Leading our call today is, Lynn Good, Chair, President and CEO; along with Brian Savoy, Executive Vice President and CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information. Actual results may differ from forward-looking statements, due to factors disclosed in today's materials and in Duke Energy's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Abby, thank you, and good morning everyone. Today, we announced 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $5.56, finishing the year within our guidance range and demonstrating once again our ability to exercise agility in managing our business and meeting our commitments. We also announced 2024 guidance of $5.85 to $6.10 with the midpoint of $5.98. This represents 6% growth from our original 2023 guidance and we extended our 5% to 7% EPS growth rate through 2028 off the midpoint of our 2024 range. We entered the year with significant momentum. 2024 marks a fundamental repositioning of our investment proposition. With the commercial renewable sale, we've transformed our business to become a fully regulated utility for the first time in decades. Along with improved regulatory constructs, we're poised to deliver on our simplified 100% regulated growth plan. Our Southeast and Midwest utilities operate in some of the fastest growing and most attractive jurisdictions across the US. We expect growth in our service territories to accelerate, as we move further into the energy transition driving substantial investment. We are now projecting $73 billion in CapEx over the next five years, an $8 billion increase versus our previous plan. Turning to slide 5, 2023 marked another year of outstanding accomplishments across our business, building on our compelling growth story as we move into '24. As I mentioned, we completed our portfolio repositioning and delivered multiple constructive regulatory outcomes, while maintaining our commitment to safety and customers. We executed five rate cases and I'm proud of the constructive results the team has delivered. We received orders approving $45 billion in historic and future rate base investments that will provide growth to customers for years to come. There was also a recognition of the rising cost of capital with improving ROEs and equity ratios. And in North Carolina, we implemented forward-looking multiyear rate plans for the first time ever. The performance-based regulations authorized by HB 951, provides certainty, predictability and value to customers and the company. This milestone was accomplished through years of work with policymaker\u2019s, legislators and other stakeholders. Shifting to operations. Our teams performed well throughout the year, serving our customers in extreme weather conditions and restoring power following historic storms in Indiana and Florida. Providing safe reliable power in all seasons and circumstances remains our mission. In fact, in 2023, Duke Energy Florida had its best reliability performance in more than a decade, largely due to our significant storm protection plan investments. These investments also aided restoration efforts in Hurricane Adalia, saving outage minutes and speeding return to service. In the Carolinas, our nuclear fleet continues to generate safe, reliable carbon-free power, achieving a capacity factor of 96%, the 25th year in a row above 90%. And underpinning all of this in a hallmark of our commitment to operational excellence, 2023 marked our best safety performance in company history, as measured by a total incident case rate of 0.31. Safety is a core value at Duke Energy and I'm proud of our employees' commitment to event-free operations. Finally, the Piedmont team continues to excel in customer service. For the second year in a row, J.D. Power ranked Piedmont number one in residential customer satisfaction for natural gas services in the Southeast. And our Carolinas electric utilities continue to achieve strong results as well, remaining in the top quartile. Moving to Slide 6, we start the year entering the next phase of our energy transition, a period of execution and record infrastructure build to meet the evolving energy needs of our customers and communities. We're working with stakeholders to develop resource plans to support the phenomenal growth in our communities. In the Carolinas, demand is already outpacing the forecast used in our August resource plan filings and we filed supplemental portfolios in January. We're committed to meeting this growth with a diverse and increasingly clean energy mix that includes renewables, natural gas, next-generation nuclear and storage resources, as well as energy efficiency and demand response tools. We're also taking steps to build new generation in North Carolina, we'll file CPCNs for over two gigawatts of new natural gas generation in 2024. We'll continue to advance annual solar procurements targeting one gigawatt per year. And in Indiana we'll file CPCNs for new generation resources around midyear. These new facilities will add to our diverse mix of resources and are critical to meeting growing customer demand as we reliably exit coal by 2035. From a regulatory perspective, we've announced two rate cases in 2024 starting with DEC South Carolina in early January. Since the last case in 2018, we've invested more than $1.5 billion to improve reliability and resiliency and meet the growing energy needs of our more than 650,000 customers. And in Florida, we notified the commission of our intent to file a rate case in April. Similar to our current multiyear rate plan, which runs through 2024, this filing will cover three years of investments beginning in 2025. Our plan will add over 1000 megawatts of new solar and include over $3 billion of grid investments to serve population growth, increased reliability and reduced storm-related outages. Finally since our last rate cases at Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont North Carolina, we've continued to make investments to strengthen our system and we're evaluating the timing of our next filings in these jurisdictions. In closing, I'll move to Slide 7, which depicts the transition of Duke Energy over the last many years to the premier regulated utility than it is today. The strategic and financial clarity provided by optimizing our portfolio over the last decade has simplified Duke Energy to a powerful, core regulated business operating in vibrant jurisdictions, growing through population migration and strong commercial and industrial economic development. Our growth potential is the highest it's been in decades and is reflected in our $73 billion capital plan. This plan is driven by grid investments to transform the largest T&D system in the US and IRP-related generation investments to support our growing jurisdictions and fleet transition. An efficient recovery mechanisms allow us to translate these investments into customer and investor value. In closing, we have positioned Duke for long-term value creation and our path forward is clear as we navigate the coming decade of record infrastructure build. This pivotal point in our history drives a differentiated low-risk, total return proposition going forward and I'm confident we will deliver. With that let me turn the call over to Brian. Brian Savoy : Thanks, Lynn and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 8. 2023 marked a year of solid growth for our utilities. We achieved full year adjusted earnings per share of $5.56, which represents about 6% growth over 2022. For the year, we saw top line growth from constructive rate case outcomes, multiyear rate plans and rider growth across our jurisdictions. Additionally, we delivered on our cost and agility efforts, which offset record mild weather, lower volumes and higher interest expense. 2023 was a year full of significant headwinds and I'm proud of the team for executing on our agility plans including strong fourth quarter results to deliver on our financial commitments. Turning to Slide 9. We are introducing our 2024 guidance range of $5.85 to $6.10. The midpoint of $5.98 represents more than 7% growth over 2023. Within electric, we expect normal weather and retail volume growth of roughly 2%. We also entered the year with updated rates for our North Carolina utilities including the benefit of the historic base case, as well as year one of the multiyear rate plans. Additionally, we have updated rates at Duke Energy Kentucky and expect updated rates for DEC South Carolina in August. We'll see growth from year three of the Florida multiyear rate plan currently effect, and we will continue to see growth from grid investment riders in the Midwest and Florida. Partially offsetting these favorable drivers are higher interest expense as well as depreciation and property taxes on a growing asset base. Our gas segment continues to deliver strong growth with investments across all jurisdictions related to integrity management and to serve a growing customer base. Finally, we expect the other segment to be impacted by higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. We ended 2023 with an ETR of 10%. Although, we continue to pursue a robust set of tax optimization strategies, we expect our 2024 ETR will increase to between 12% and 14%. Turning to retail electric volumes on slide 10. In 2023, we saw strong residential customer growth in all jurisdictions highlighted by the Carolinas and Florida at 2.1% and 2%, respectively. In fact over the course of 2023 we added 195,000 new customers, the largest customer increase in company history and a continuation of the trend we've seen over the past few years. As a reminder, residential decoupling in North Carolina began in DEP in October and in DEC in January. This will reduce volatility and align growth with positive customer migration trends. We have also seen significant growth in economic development opportunities in our service territories as reflected in the recent supplemental Carolina's resource plan filings. As we evaluate, which projects to include in our financial plan, we recognize that site selection processes are often very competitive. We generally only include the most mature and committed projects, focusing on those with letter agreements or in very late-stage development. This gives us upside potential should additional projects progress. Economic development opportunities in our service territories are diversified across many industries. Semiconductors, EVs, batteries, pharmaceuticals, and data centers to name a few, which will provide growth from the projects themselves, as well as incremental growth from residential and supplier demand. These economic development and customer migration trends give us confidence in our 1.5% to 2% load growth expectation over the forecast period. Turning to slide 11 Duke's proven track record of cost management will support our ability to execute an energy transition that is rooted in discipline and a commitment to safety for our employees and reliability and affordability for our customers. As I mentioned before, we delivered on our significant O&M and agility targets for 2023 in response to macroeconomic headwinds and unfavorable weather. In 2024, we expect O&M to be largely flat to 2023, offsetting inflationary pressures with sustainable efficiencies and we will continue to target a flat cost structure over the five-year plan. Duke Energy is a leader in the industry when it comes to cost efficiency driven by our culture of continuous improvement. We consistently rank in the top quartile across a variety of O&M measures and our ability to manage our cost structure creates significant value for our customers and shareholders. Turning to slide 12. I'd like to provide an overview of our five-year $73 billion capital plan which has increased $8 billion over our previous plan. About half of the incremental capital is a result of rolling the plan forward a year to include 2028. The update reflects an early estimate of the supplemental Carolinas resource plan filed in January, as well as improved spend in the North Carolina multiyear rate plans. Over time our capital plan has steadily increased as we move further into the clean energy transition, supporting a 7.2% earnings base CAGR through 2028. Grid investments represent 50% of our five-year capital plan and will improve the reliability and resiliency of our system. Significant generation spend ramps up in the latter part of the plan as we add more renewables and storage assets. Extend the life of our carbon-free nuclear fleet and make prudent investments in cleaner natural gas to better serve our growing customer base. Looking ahead, about 90% of the electric investments in our capital plan are eligible for efficient recovery mechanisms, which is critical to maintaining a strong balance sheet, mitigating regulatory lag and smoothing customer rate impacts. Moving to slide 13. Our ability to execute our robust capital program is underpinned by a healthy balance sheet and we remain committed to our current credit ratings. With that in mind, we are introducing modest equity to fund the increase in capital plan we announced today. We expect to raise $500 million annually over the five-year plan starting in 2024, using at the market and dividend reinvestment programs. Turning to FFO to debt. We have provided a walk up, showing the path to achieve our 14% target by the end of '24. Compared to 2023, we expect improvements from normal weather, rate case activity, the collection of remaining deferred fuel balances, the monetization of nuclear PTCs and equity issuances under the DRIP and ATM programs. These credit supportive drivers give us confidence in achieving 14% FFO to debt in 2024 and a minimum of 14% over the long term. Let me talk a bit more about the nuclear PTC, an important element of the inflation Reduction Act that will provide substantial savings to our customers over time. As an operator of 11 low-cost nuclear units in the Carolinas, we expect to qualify for several hundred million dollars per year of nuclear PTCs beginning in '24. We intend to monetize the credits in the transferability markets established by the IRA. In North Carolina, we worked with the public staff on a settlement regarding the treatment of nuclear PTCs that was approved in our DEC rate case order last year. We will flow back the benefits to customers over a four-year amortization period. This treatment allows customers to benefit from bill reductions over time and is supportive of the utility's credit metrics. Moving to slide 14, our robust capital plan, strong customer growth and constructive jurisdictions provide a compelling growth story. And our commitment to the dividend remains unchanged. We understand its importance to our shareholders and 2024 marks the 98th consecutive year of paying a quarterly cash dividend. We intend to keep growing our dividend, balancing the payout ratio with the need to fund our capital plan. Over the next five years, we anticipate a steady decline in the payout ratio and we are adjusting our target payout ratio to 60% to 70% from 65% to 75%. This updated range provides additional financial flexibility, minimizes external equity needs over time and is more consistent with the company investing in our current pace. As always, dividends will be subject to approval by the Board of Directors. In closing, 2023 was a year of execution and we have tremendous momentum as we head into 2024. The fundamentals of our business are stronger than ever, giving us confidence in our ability to deliver sustainable value and 5% to 7% growth through 2028. With that, we'll open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Shar Pourreza : Hey guys. Good morning. Lynn Good : Good morning, Shar. Shar Pourreza : Good morning. Just on the CapEx expectations, the $8 billion increase reflects, obviously an early estimate of the Carolina IRP filing at the end of March. Can you just maybe elaborate on, what you mean by early? So what scenario is embedded? Is there room for upside? And then to what extent does the plan include IRPs you'll be filing this year in Indiana and Kentucky? Thanks. Lynn Good : Shar, thank you. An early estimate would say, we've begun to contemplate what the January IRP includes and I think, you've seen us demonstrate that we've not only seen an increase in megawatts, but frankly we've seen an increase in price for certain of the resources that we're adding. But we believe that capital plan is subject to continued refinement, not only as we move through regulatory process in the Carolinas, but we will introduce more around Indiana. We have a 10-year site plan that we're filing in Florida this year. So, refinement will continue with the capital plan. But what I would leave you with Shar is, we have a wealth of opportunities. I mean there is growth that is strong throughout all of our service territories and we'll be making along with our regulators the decisions on reliability, affordability, increasingly clean, as we move through these IRPs, so just a really strong growth story for Duke. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Okay. So more to come. And then just, Lynn, on the nuclear PTC, it's a material driver of that FFO. I guess -- what are you seeing in sort of that transferability market from a demand perspective, what discounts are you seeing? And then like we're getting questions on this all morning is like how do you price in the risk of an IRA repeal and in the worst-case scenario, can you make up that lost FFO? Lynn Good : Yeah. So, a couple of things. On the transferability market, Shar, we have begun to test that market. We had a pilot transferability transaction in 2023. The discount on the transferability was right within our planning range. So very strong response to that initial test, and the treasury group and team are already working on how we might execute in 2024 as well. So we do believe the market is developing. And I think around the industry, you've seen similar transactions executed in an effective way. On a potential repeal, what I would say to you is we continue to be very engaged with policymakers at the federal and state level around the need for infrastructure as we continue to pursue growth, on-shoring of US manufacturing, leadership in artificial intelligence, battery manufacturing, EVs, et cetera. And we believe, there's a lot of support to continue to build that infrastructure, and to build it at a price that's affordable. And the point I would emphasize for us on tax credits around infrastructure, it goes directly to customers. It reduces price over time to customers dollar for dollar. So I believe both of those messages continue to resonate with policymakers and we'll continue to make them. I think it's essential that we keep moving on this infrastructure build in order to serve the growth that we're seeing in our service territories. On the impact of credit metrics, our goal, sure is to be minimum of 14%. So even in the event that, the credits could be impacted in some way over time. We still believe we'll have time to adjust. We'll look at our overall plans and continue to run our business with a commitment to our balance sheet and with a strong balance sheet to pursue the growth. Shar Pourreza : Okay. Great. Fantastic. Thank you, guys. See you next week. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Your line is open. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, Good morning, Lynn and team. Look, I just wanted to follow-up on the last question a little bit in the same focus on the nuclear PTCs here. Just in as much as can you discuss the reduction in the forecasted rate base? Obviously, an increase in CapEx year-to-date and obviously, there's some timing-related matters as it pertains to the nuclear PTC impact in rate base. But can you talk to, what other factors might be impacting rate base, not just in the near you're here, but through the forecast as you think about the puts and takes here? Lynn Good : Yeah. So, maybe a couple of things. On the capital side, Julien, much as Shar described, we'll continue to refine these with the wealth of opportunities, I do believe we'll have an opportunity to continue to introduce really strong capital in all of our jurisdictions. But on translating to rate base growth, what we show you with rate base is capital offset by tax attributes. So the nuclear PTCs, because we're amortizing them over a four year period in a very credit supportive way, we have a reduction in rate base as a result of that. So this is an opportunity for us to do both, grow and maintain the strength of the balance sheet. And we feel like we have developed a very constructive settlement in North Carolina to achieve exactly that. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah. No, that makes sense. There's just nothing else that's impacting that. And then can you discuss the revised load growth outlook, right? I get 2% is a real acceleration from the 0.5% to 1% from last year and ultimately, I get that last year had down load, if you will. So it's a new starting point. But just to reconcile a little bit of the low growth commentary, especially considering the commentary from the last call here, what has sort of reaccelerated? How do you think about both the near year and the longer term here, if you will, just a little bit more? Lynn Good : Yeah. Thank you, Julien. I'm going to turn to Brian to discuss it. Brian Savoy : Yeah. Good morning, Julien. So, when we look at 2024, the setup on load growth is really underpinned by three main points. So you start with economic development visibility we have in 2024 projects that are in late-stage construction that are coming online. And we've got that on one of our slides. And that represents a little under a 1% growth as we look into 2024. On the residential side of things, we've seen this normalization coming out of COVID of return to the office, right? During COVID, we had a lot of residential usage at homes. As return to the office, you saw this kind of lower usage at homes, more in commercial businesses. And the back part of 2023, we saw that level out. So we will start growing residential more in line with customer migration trends, which has been really strong 1.7%, 1.8% in recent years. And so residential growth, we expect to be on an upward trajectory. And then lastly, the existing C&I customers where we saw a reduction in load in 2023 and when we talked about it throughout the year. Those customers are very optimistic in 2024. They've kind of seen a rebound happening maybe mid-ish year. So those three factors give us confidence that 2% load growth in 2024 is definitely in our sights. Lynn Good : And over the long term, Julien, all of the things that Brian talked about we're going to continue to experience customer migration. Our existing customer base continues to demonstrate some strength over the five-year period. So probably the most new or significant driver is this economic development load. And we've given you a range of what we're seeing, and what we've put on the slide are the things that we believe have a high degree of confidence of being achieved. So DRIP is moving, letters of agreement have been signed and we're moving forward. And so the combination of our existing base population migration and the strong economic development gave us confidence to raise the long-term growth rate. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. So it sounds like things have reaccelerated here even just quarter-over-quarter even just on the margin? Lynn Good : Well, and I think Julien, we were continuing to grapple with this economic development all through 2023 and came to our filing here in the Carolinas in January, really reckoning with where we think this is going. So we have continued to mature our own thinking, working with our customers, working with the prospects coming to the area and believe this represents a really solid range. And when we're looking at that range, the growth is going to come along with it on megawatt hours and that's what you're seeing in our update. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Great. Thank you guys. See you soon. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steve Fleishman : Thank you. Brian Savoy : Good morning, Steve. Lynn Good : Hi, Steve. Steve Fleishman : Good morning, Lynn and Brian. Just one more on the nuclear PTC. The -- any sense on when we're actually going to get details from the treasury and setting it any update there? Brian Savoy : Steve, our best intel is the first half of the year. So we're thinking kind of sometime in Q2 we would get the final guidance from treasury and I think that's the general consensus. Steve Fleishman : Okay. And obviously you need that to then go do the monetization I assume? Brian Savoy : Sure. Sure. Steve Fleishman : Yeah. Okay. On the financing the equity plan, the DRIP and ATM, any kind of color on how much of that can be done through DRIP relative to ATM? Lynn Good : Yeah. So Steve you should think about DRIP as being about $200 million a year. It's about 40% of it. Steve Fleishman : Yeah. And then just on the gas plant filing in the Carolinas what -- when would these -- when would you be roughly targeting for these plants to come online? Lynn Good : So 2028, 2029 Steve. Combined cycle plants two and 2028 -- or I'm sorry CTs two and 2028 CCs one and 2028 one and 2029. Steve Fleishman : Okay. But obviously some of the capital would be hitting in AFDC hitting within the end of your? Lynn Good : Yeah. You start to see it. The largest capital spend is in the last couple of years is construction as you know from history on these. But you'll see us beginning to ramp up well within this five-year period. Steve Fleishman : Okay, great. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you. Lynn Good : All right. Thank you, Steve. Operator : Our next question comes from David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open. Lynn Good : Hi David. David Arcaro : As we think about the 1.5% to 2% load growth I was just curious is that concentrated in certain service territories more than others? Are you seeing certain states growing faster versus others in your footprint? Brian Savoy : David I would think about the Carolinas has seen the largest portion of the economic development prospects we see. But we do see healthy growth across our jurisdictions. I mean Indiana with this restoring of manufacturing has really seen economic development growing. Florida continues to grow in a really strong way in 2% customer migration trends as well as the commercial businesses that support it. So, I would say Carolinas is slightly ahead of the others but all of really good growth. David Arcaro : Okay, got it. Not several percentage points faster in any specific state, but fairly tightly grouped around there? Lynn Good : Yes. And David I would say building on what Brian said residential growth has been stronger in the Carolinas and Florida. Commercial and Industrial in the Midwest has been good and it's also been good in the Carolinas. So, the growth kind of varies by customer class but I would go back to where I commented a moment ago we have a wealth of opportunities. And these are not only good for Duke Energy's growth but they're good for our states. It's capital investment it's job creation supply chain is coming with a lot of these manufacturers. So it's good for the service territories that we are serving. David Arcaro : Understood. Yes, that's helpful. And I'm not sure if you gave this level of color, but just going forward, as you're thinking about all of these other CapEx opportunities to add to the plan, how are you thinking about financing that? Is there a rule of thumb for how much incremental equity you would need kind of per dollar of CapEx as you're expanding the investment going forward? Lynn Good : David I think it's premature to talk about that because the first thing that we'll do is run through capital optimization and allocation putting the capital in the area that both delivers the most customer value and is delivering the best returns. And I think we'll have more on this refinement of capital as we move through IRP approvals in the Carolinas this year and then Indiana next year 10-year site plan as well. So, we'll continue to keep you updated and our commitment remains to growth and a strong balance sheet. David Arcaro : Okay, great. Appreciate the color. Thanks so much. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Nicholas Campanella of Barclays. Please go ahead. Nicholas Campanella : Hey thanks for taking my questions today. Good morning. Brian Savoy : Good morning Nick. Nicholas Campanella : Good morning. So, I guess just the payout ratio you're taking that down obviously which seems very prudent. I know you've already been kind of growing into a lower payout ratio over time. The dividend growth has been lower than the EPS growth here. So, just I'm kind of wondering just how to think about your 5% to 7% EPS CAGR now like where you are in that range? Are you at the high low or midpoint of that? And then when do you get back into this 60% to 70% payout ratio in the plan? Thank you. Lynn Good : Yes. So Nick, pulling that all together we're very confident in our 5% to 7% growth rate. We have been building the capital plan to accomplish that as well as the regulatory mechanisms for several years. And so what we're putting in front of you we have a high degree of confidence on. And as a result of that we see the payout ratio declining over the next five years we'll be under 70% in 2024. And so as we look at our commitment to the dividend. We intend to continue growing it. We're committed to the dividend as we have been for a long period of time. But believe in this moment with the level of capital that we have, that introducing some financial flexibility in our range so that we can make good choices around dividend, capital and growth is just prudent. And so as you know we'll look at dividend every year. The Board is involved in that approval process. But given the total composition of growth in dividend, we believe a 60% to 70% payout ratio is appropriate at this point. Nicholas Campanella : Okay. I appreciate that. And then I guess just \u2013 I know you just recently filed in Florida, you have a history of \u2013 there's a history of settlements in that state and constructive outcomes. Is just anything kind of changing in regulatory strategy that wouldn't allow you to pursue another settlement in the future? Lynn Good : No, Nick, what we have accomplished so far is procedurally what we need to do to provide notice and the filing would follow late March early April, as you know we have a history of engaging with intervening parties in all of our jurisdictions as part of the regulatory process and we will do \u2013 endeavor to do that in Florida as well. And we'll keep you posted every step of the way. It's a very constructive jurisdiction in Florida, understanding the need for infrastructure to balance the growth that the state is maintaining or achieving. And also maintaining critical infrastructure investment for reliability storm response, et cetera. So we'll look forward to keeping you updated on the rate case. Nicholas Campanella : Thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Durgesh Chopra : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thank you for\u2026 Lynn Good : Good morning. Durgesh Chopra : Good morning, Lynn. Maybe just I think the equity $500 million to have a year total for the plan versus the CapEx raises towards the low end? I think you might have said 30% to 50% funded those equity in the past. So maybe just a little bit more color kind of what puts you at that low end of the range since sort of we discussed this in November last year? Lynn Good : Yes. Durgesh, I think about all of these variables, the capital, the regulatory outcomes, the equity issuance, the fact that we see nuclear PTC is something that we've been able to negotiate in a credit-supportive way. You've got all of those variables that we evaluate in establishing the plan that we have in front of you and believe that at this level that 30% ratio gives us the best match between the growth we're trying to achieve as well as the strength of the balance sheet. And so that will be \u2013 that's always our goal is to achieve both for investors and we believe we've accomplished that. Durgesh Chopra : That's helpful. And thank you. And then the rate base is when I look at year-over-year growth rate in rate base it's pretty healthy. It's within your 5% to 7% EPS, long-term EPS growth guidance. Do we think about annual EPS growth rates within that range as well in that 5% to 7% range? Or is that more kind of a CAGR approach and back-end weighted? Lynn Good : No, Durgesh, we endeavor to hit it every year, every year and that's how we plan our investments, that's how we plan our strategies around regulatory and otherwise and so that's how I would share it with you year-over-year. Durgesh Chopra : That's very clear. Thank you, Lynn. Appreciate the time. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Ross Fowler of UBS. Please go ahead. Ross Fowler : Good morning, Lynn. Good morning, Brian. How are you? Lynn Good : Hi, Ross. Brian Savoy : Hi, Ross. Ross Fowler : So first one maybe to follow-up on Nick's question, just shifting back to Indiana. How are you thinking about the timing and what consideration should we be thinking about for the Indiana rate case? Lynn Good : So Ross, we evaluate as you know periodically, where we are with capital investment, rate case cycle. And in Indiana, we have a lot of investment in riders, but some of those riders are 80% of the investment. So we need a general base rate case to pick up the other 20%. We also have in front of us in Indiana, CPCNs for generation that are in our regulatory mines or regulatory calendar. So we'll continue to evaluate that, what is the right timing, when do we go in? How does it relate to other things that we're trying to accomplish in Indiana, and by flagging it for you in this call, we're indicating that it's under review, and we'll keep you posted as we get closer to a final decision. Ross Fowler : Appreciate that very much. And then maybe one for you, Brian. But -- as I look at the bridge to 2024, over 40% of that is coming from this $0.12 of other. And I think I get the higher interest rates impact and maybe can you scale the -- or scope the other things in there for me, there's a lower tax rate and then there's return from investments. And I think that's probably coming from either Bison the insurance side or the NMC stuff in Saudi Arab around Petrochem? Or how do I think about that as I look at by 2024? Brian Savoy : Yeah. I would point to the tax optimization, Ross. In 2023, we had an opportunity for an item in tax optimization that was, I would say, outsized from our normal tax optimization work that part of our agility efforts, which you would expect us to do because we had record mild weather, we were looking at every opportunity to offset that. As we look forward in 2024, we're seeing a more consistent level of tax optimization that we had in previous years. So that's the other major driver in the other section. But we still have a robust set of tax optimization and our tax team is doing a fabulous work on that front. But that's what I'd point to. And we signaled our agility of $300 million that we were pursuing in 2023. About half of it will be sustainable. And I would point to that tax optimization as about that half that's not sustainable. Ross Fowler : Okay. Okay. I got you. Thank you, Brian for that clarity. Appreciate it very much. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our Q&A session for today. So I'll turn the call back over to Lynn Good for any closing comments. Lynn Good : Well, let me close by just thanking everyone for participation today. I know, when we do these annual updates. We give you 40 to 50 slides to digest. So, we're also available for questions and comments, the IR team, Brian, I'm available, and really appreciate your interest and investment in Duke. Thanks so much. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] I'll now hand you over to Abby Motsinger, Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin. Abby Motsinger : Thank you, Lydia, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Review and Business Update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair and CEO; along with Harry Sideris, President; and Brian Savoy, CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information. Actual results may differ from forward-looking statements due to factors disclosed in today's materials and in Duke Energy's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Abby, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Today, we announced first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.44, delivering a strong start to the year. These results are $0.24 above last year, driven by growth from rate activity across our jurisdictions, strengthening retail volumes and improved weather. We remain confident in our outlook and are reaffirming our 2024 guidance range of $5.85 to $6.10 and our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2028. We have a clear path forward as a fully regulated utility operating in some of the most attractive and fastest-growing areas of the country. Our strategy will drive continued growth, underpinned by our 5-year $73 billion capital plan, efficient recovery mechanisms and track record of constructive regulatory outcomes. Moving to Slide 5. Our jurisdictions are experiencing unprecedented growth from population migration and economic development. We're committed to meeting these increasing customer demand through an all-of-the-above strategy that preserves affordability and reliability as we decarbonize. In doing so, 2024 marks an important stage in our fleet transition as we move from the planning phase to project execution. In Florida, we're on track to have 1,500 megawatts of utility-owned solar in service by year-end. And in our recently filed 10-year site plan, we expect to more than triple the amount of solar on our system by 2033. In the Carolinas, we're completing annual solar procurements that will add approximately 1,500 megawatts to the grid each year beginning in 2027. These investments are part of our goal to have 30,000 megawatts of regulated renewables on our system by 2035. In the Carolinas, we filed certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity in March to build more than 2 gigawatts of new, advanced class of natural gas generation. The filings with the NCUC include 2 simple-cycle combustion turbines and 1 combined cycle plant, consistent with the Carolinas resource plan. Pending regulatory approvals, construction is planned to start in 2026 with all units operational by the end of 2028. Each of these new facilities will be sited in existing coal plants and will provide needed dispatchable generation when those units retire. We recognize there's a lot of attention on natural gas in its role in achieving net zero. We believe natural gas must be a part of not just Duke's, but our nation's energy transition strategy in the face of unprecedented demand from AI data centers, chips manufacturers and other economic development, natural gas remains an essential tool to provide reliable and affordable energy for customers and complements our substantial investments in renewables and energy storage. As you know, EPA recently released rules that placed limits on certain baseload generation sources. While the state of this rule will soon be in the hands of the courts, we will continue to advocate for solutions to reliably and affordably serve the growing energy needs of our customers and communities. As we step into this period of significant infrastructure build for the company, we recently appointed Harry Sideris, President of Duke Energy. As President, Harry has responsibility for all of our electric and gas utilities, including all aspects of operations and regulatory activities. Harry is a 28-year company veteran and has an exceptional track record of accomplishment and leadership across many functions. He began his career in generation, led environmental health and safety, served as the President of our Florida utility and most recently led transmission, distribution and customer operations, including economic development. Harry is a trusted member of the executive leadership team and in his new role, he remains committed to delivering value to our customers and our investors. I'm pleased to introduce him for the first time on an earnings call and his new role as President. And with that, Harry, I'll turn it over to you to go through the jurisdictional highlights. Harry Sideris : Thank you, Lynn, for the introduction. I'm excited for the new role and look forward to leading our utilities and operations through this important time in our energy transition. Turning to Slide 6. Meeting our customers' expectations requires collaboration with regulators, policymakers and other stakeholders, and we continue to make great progress across our jurisdictions. Starting with South Carolina, Hearings begin May 20 in our Duke Energy Carolinas rate case. Since our last rate case in 2018, our rate base has increased by almost $2 billion, driven by investments to improve reliability and resiliency and meet the growing energy needs of our customers. We expect new rates to be implemented August 1. Shifting to Florida. In April, we filed our next 3-year multiyear rate plan that will begin in 2025. The plan includes grid investments to enhance reliability, decrease outages and shorten restoration times, building on Duke Energy's Florida's best reliability year in over a decade in 2023.  The filing also covers investments to add new solar and battery as well as improve the efficiency of our current generation assets. Even with the requested base rate increases, we expect overall customer bills to decrease in 2025 as fuel under recovery, storm restoration costs and legacy purchase power contracts expire at the end of the year. In Indiana, we filed our first rate case in 4 years in April. Since our last case, we've invested more than $1.6 billion to support the state's growing population and increase the resiliency and security of the grid.  The case includes a forward test year and 2 rate step-ups starting in the first quarter of 2025, smoothing the impact to customers. And finally, Piedmont Natural Gas also filed a rate case in North Carolina in April. The request covers significant infrastructure investments to comply with federal safety regulations, enhance the customer experience and provide safe, reliable natural gas service. As part of the filing, Piedmont is also requesting concurrent rate reductions for pass-through natural gas costs, which will help mitigate the impacts to the customer bill. We plan to implement interim rates November 1 with the final order expected in January. We've made great progress in the first quarter, advancing rate cases and fleet transition projects across our footprint. As we embark on this period of significant infrastructure build, we have confidence that our investment plan will deliver sustainable value to shareholders and 5% to 7% earnings growth. With that, let me turn the call over to Brian. Brian Savoy : Thanks, Harry, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. Our first quarter reported and adjusted earnings per share were $1.44. This compares to reported and adjusted earnings per share of $1.01 and $1.20 last year. Within the segments, Electric Utilities & Infrastructure was up $0.29 compared to last year. Growth was driven by rate increases, higher volumes and improved weather. Partially offsetting these items were higher interest expense and depreciation on a growing asset base. As a reminder, residential decoupling was in effect for both of our North Carolina utilities this quarter, which moderated the impact of a mild winter in the Carolinas. Moving to Gas Utilities & Infrastructure, results were flat compared to last year. And finally, the Other segment was down $0.05, primarily due to higher interest expense. With a strong start to the year, we're on track to deliver on our 2024 EPS guidance range. Turning to Slide 8. We were pleased to see solid growth in weather-normal volumes this quarter versus last year. Customer growth remains robust in our jurisdictions, led by the Carolinas and Florida, which both grew 2.4%. We're also encouraged to see improving residential usage across our jurisdictions. Commercial and industrial volumes were up over 1% versus last year, driven by strength in the commercial sector. We are closely monitoring economic trends and remain in regular conversations with our largest customers.  Notably, these customers continue to convey expectations for growing power needs in the second half of the year. Combined with new economic development projects coming online, we expect growth to accelerate throughout the year. Turning to Slide 9. The impact of economic development activity in our jurisdictions cannot be overstated. We are gearing up to serve up to 18,000 gigawatt hours of additional load from these projects in 2028. This is up 2,000 gigawatt hours from the projection we just shared in February, demonstrating the strength of our economic development pipeline. As a reminder, we take a risk-adjusted approach to our forecast and generally only include the most mature and committed projects. We've included a few photos that showcased the impressive size and scale of the construction activity underway. Pictured at the top of the slide is a substation that will serve Wolfspeed's $5 billion semiconductor manufacturing facility in North Carolina. The new factory will bring about 1,800 jobs to the state. We've recently energized the initial transformer bank in the substation, and Wolfspeed expects the facility to begin production by early next year. This project and others across many sectors, including batteries, data centers, EVs and pharmaceuticals to name a few, are making tangible progress and will provide meaningful load growth in our service territories. We operate in some of the most attractive jurisdictions for both economic development and customer migration, which underpins our confidence in our 2% volume growth forecast in 2024 and 1.5% to 2% growth rate over the 5-year planning horizon. Turning to Slide 10. We recognize the importance of a strong balance sheet as we execute one of the sector's largest capital programs. We are on track to achieve 14% FFO to debt by the end of this year, which represents 100 basis points of cushion to our Moody's downgrade threshold. The biggest driver of our FFO improvement is the implementation of the North Carolina rate cases, which add nearly $700 million of annual revenues. Combined with the collection of remaining deferred fuel balances, monetization of tax credits and programmatic equity issuances, we have clear line of sight to achieving our target. As disclosed in February, we expect to issue $500 million of common equity annually over the 5-year plan via our DRIP and ATM programs. We're off to a great start, having priced just over $100 million year-to-date. We also completed approximately 65% of our planned, long-term debt issuances for 2024 in the first quarter, which helps to derisk our plan. We've raised $4.6 billion in long-term debt with an average interest rate of 5.19% and an average tenure of 13 years. We've been strategic in our approach, reducing floating rate exposure amid a rising rate environment and further diversifying our investor base with the euro offering in April. As we have demonstrated this quarter and over many years, we are committed to our credit ratings and a strong balance sheet as we execute our growth objectives. Moving to Slide 11. We remain confident in delivering our 2024 earnings guidance range of $5.85 to $6.10 and growth of 5% to 7% through 2028. We operate in constructive, growing jurisdictions, and the fundamentals of our business are stronger than ever. We are well positioned to achieve our growth targets for the year, which combined with our attractive dividend yields provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for shareholders. With that, we'll open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar Pourreza : Obviously, you guys reaffirm that 1.5% to 2% low growth assumptions, but also kind of concurrently kind of increase the economic development activities. I mean, obviously, we've seen several of your peers raise low growth assumptions, kind of levered to that C&I customer backdrop, including large data centers coming into their states. I guess, Lynn, what's the trigger point and timing on when you will maybe reguide around load growth, which to us seems conservative, especially in the Carolinas? And could the opportunities kind of be accretive to your EPS growth guide like we heard from one of your Southeastern peers? Brian Savoy : Shar, I'll take that. We continue to be encouraged by the pace of economic development opportunities. I mean every time we do a new load forecast, we see more opportunities. And that's demonstrated by what we showed this morning. We typically update our full financial plan in February, right? And we feel like updating load without updating the CapEx to support the load might be a bit disconnected and not so the full picture. But we do see clearly more tailwinds than headwinds as we look at growth over time. All of this sign is a good -- all of this points to a good sign of long-term EPS growth. I would point to on the EPS side of things, load growth, the capital opportunities for the energy transition. All this gives us a high degree of confidence in our 5% to 7%. And as we look throughout the plan, probably later in the plan, pushes us in the higher end of the range. But it gives us the opportunity if all this transpires. We are taking a very calculated position on our load growth, and we want to be smart about updating the plan prematurely before we put the capital to support the new load. Lynn Good : Shar, one thing I might add is just to give you a metric on this, 1,000 gigawatt hours represents 0.1%  increase in our load growth. So we are trending to the higher end of that 1.5% to 2%, and we'll continue to update you during '24, if we see more opportunities materialize. And as Brian said, we'll do a comprehensive update in February. I think the other thing I would note, given the size of our company, I believe the move from about 0.5% load growth to 1.5% to 2% is quite strong, and we're proud of that, and we'll keep going. But I think that metric of 1,000 gigawatt hours being about 0.1% should help you get a sense of how we're moving. Shahriar Pourreza : Got it. Okay. So as we head into February's update. I appreciate that. And then maybe just one more question for Brian. Brian, obviously, you guys have kind of a perpetual preferred, which has a dividend reset coming. I think in September, what's the plan, I guess, to refinance it? What's embedded in your numbers? Brian Savoy : No, it's a good question, Shar. And it's clearly in our financing plan to address that perpetual preferred. And we're going to look at all the options available and preserving the balance sheet support that, that product presents as well as what the market is paying for. We saw some deals yesterday that are encouraging, we'll look at those and other tools as we move towards September. But repricing the preferred at the current rates, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. So we're looking at ways to take that out and use other tools. Shahriar Pourreza : Okay. Perfect. Fantastic, guys. And Harry, congrats on your first of many earnings calls. Big congrats. Harry Sideris : Thanks, Shar. Lynn Good : Thank you, Shar. Operator : Our next question comes from David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley. David Arcaro : You could elaborate -- I'm wondering if you -- how you're thinking about the new EPA rules and how that could affect some of your IRPs, just longer-term resource plans that are in flight right now? Lynn Good : I'll take that. To your point, we're looking very carefully at the rule, but also looking very carefully at how we meet the growth in our service territory, continue to decarbonize and maintain an eye on affordability and reliability. We have CPCNs in front of North Carolina right now. And those processes will continue over the course of 2024. They're very public. We think that will be a great opportunity to really present the case for how we can meet this load within all of the above strategy. We are also in the process of doing an IRP in Indiana. And we'll reflect the implications of the new rule in that IRP. So I would indicate that we're continuing to study what this might mean. We're a week into it, looking at everything from gas to co-firing to conversions, all with an eye on reliability and affordability and recognizing the meeting of load, addressing an aging coal fleet is a part of the formula that we'll consider. I think litigation is something that's also being looked at across the industry, because there are a number of questions within the rule, and we're evaluating that as well. David Arcaro : Got it. And then just following up on the topic of load growth and kind of what CapEx could come from that. Could you maybe elaborate on your thinking there as you do find more economic development opportunities and potential upside to the load growth forecast, what does that mean for your capital plan in terms of could there be further generation, but also maybe on the T&D side, if you could elaborate on how you're thinking about what T&D expansions and upgrades might come out of what we're seeing in longer-term load growth increases? Brian Savoy : No, David. This is Brian. I'll take that. It's a really good question and one we evaluate every single day here in Duke Energy. As we find a way to serve our customers in a reliable and affordable way, we know we're going to need more resources, because we're seeing more demand on the system. And it's -- to your point, it's not just generation. It's T&D investments, too. And the teams across the Duke Energy evaluate how we're going to put the loads in the best places as well as when we talk about economic development opportunities, we present customers with the places that have generation capacity and T&D capacity to support them or the modest upgrades that we need. As we look out in time, we see an expanding CapEx profile. We've guided $73 billion for 5 years, but over the 10-year plan, $170 billion to $180 billion. And that contemplates higher resource needs to serve this increasing load. And we're going to do so that drives growth for our investors as well as preserves a strong balance sheet. And I think like I said, to Shar's question, we want to bring all this together in our next financial update as we roll the plan to 2029 that will have a fulsome view of both capital, load demand as well as how we're going to finance all of that. Lynn Good : David, the one thing I would add. We've been really successful over the last many years in developing modern regulatory mechanisms for grid investment. And those grid investments are running in every jurisdiction to really prepare for this generation transition, and that will continue. So if you look at our next 5 years, largely reinvestments. And so we'll keep that going at a pace that makes sense.  And just to emphasize Brian's point, we have such a wealth of opportunity here in both generation and grid investment that we see sustained growth out of our jurisdictions in a very constructive way, delivering returns to shareholders over a long period of time. So we're excited about what this growth potential represents. Operator : Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore. Durgesh Chopra : I just had 2 clarification questions. First, can you remind in North Carolina, if any sort of intertwinings between the CPCN process and your IRPs? And then second, the CPCN ads Will that be incremental to your current CapEx plan? Or is that already incorporated into the current CapEx plan? Lynn Good : So Harry, you want to talk about the CPCN and IRP process in the Carolinas. And Durgesh, I'll take the second question, those CPCN investments are in the capital plan. Harry Sideris : Yes. So Durgesh, we're in the process of our CIRP (sic) [ IRP ]  proceedings. Well, we expect a hearing in July in North Carolina and in South Carolina in September, and we expect an order later this year in December and November for each of those states. And we proposed 3 different pathways, Path 1, Path 2 and Path 3, with the preferred path being Path. This is showing a 2-gigawatt increase from our supplemental filing in January from our previous filing. We're still focused on making sure that we have an affordable and reliable plan for the customers in North Carolina while meeting our needs for our carbon reductions. The plans still show that we're going to be out of coal by 2035. And it's adding an additional resources, particularly solar and batteries and new gas as well. We've been through some of the hearings and the proceedings will continue this summer, but we feel very comfortable in what we're putting forth to the commissions and look forward to defending our case and talking through it with stakeholders. Lynn Good : And Durgesh, on the CPCNs, we would expect the IRP hearings to occur and the CPCN hearings to follow. So the time line that Harry just outlined would have all of this in front of the commission in the second half of this year. And so we'll keep you informed every step of the way. Durgesh Chopra : Awesome. Just quickly, Lynn, just though, are the IRPs incremental to the CPCN filings, the gigawatts that you're proposing? I'm thinking the answer is yes. Lynn Good : Durgesh, well, the way this works is the IRP is a multiyear view of generation. And it includes renewables and batteries and energy efficiency, demand response, the entire collection of resources necessary to meet load. The CPCN is a process to achieve approval of unique and discrete assets. So these gas plants that are included in the IRP go through a separate proceeding so that we can share cost estimates and the time line for when we would build those assets. So you should think about the filings as complementary. Operator : The next question comes from Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho. Anthony Crowdell : Just I guess if I could -- you talked about earlier of maybe the load growth is more back-end loaded. You guys have updated on the fourth quarter call. And I guess, if I could think of that and maybe how that maybe translates into earnings growth. Is the balance sheet where you'd like it to be? Your target is 14% at the end of '24, you believe you'll be there. And I know the company is already focused on the balance sheet. But as we think maybe earnings potential is stronger in the back end of the plan, would that be an opportunity to give yourself more cushion or you're happy with where you're targeting at the end of '24? Brian Savoy : That's a good question, Anthony. And as we've mentioned in the Q4 call, 14% FFO for 2024, 14% plus as we look out in time. So we're not going to stay put at 14%. We're going to continue to improve it over time. And guiding through that, we've got the benefit of the North Carolina rate cases this year. Next year, we'll have the benefit of all the other jurisdictions, Florida, Indiana, Piedmont, South Carolina, all these rate actions are underway that will continue to support top line growth, which also then supports the credit. And as we look out in the plan, I think the potential to earn at the higher end of the range also gives us opportunity to continue to strengthen the balance sheet. So I think we're going to take a balanced approach that provides growth for investors as well as protect a strong balance sheet over time. Operator : The next question is from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Carly Davenport : Maybe just as you think about your capital plans, both from an investment and the grid perspective and also on new generation. Have you been seeing anything -- any constraints from a supply chain perspective, whether it's in procuring kind of generation kits or transmission equipment that we should be keeping in mind? Brian Savoy : Carly, thanks for that question. As we've worked the capital plan and all the supply chain challenges since COVID, it's kind of been issue by issue. I would say a couple of years ago, solar panels was a hot area, and we entered into framework agreements over a long period of time to secure our solar panel needs. We also had transformers last year that was a really hot spot. It's still a tight market, but we now are going through these with the size and scale of Duke Energy and really partnering with OEMs on how we're going to work with them multiple years in a row. And as we look to build generation at scale, we're looking at areas like EPC contractors, turbine manufacturers and other components to support the generation build. And we're going to take a similar approach. But I think what we've learned is that we must partner with 1 or 2 suppliers over multiple years to give them certainty on the revenue side, give us certainty on the components and labor on our side. So it's been a successful model and it's one we want to replicate as we advance the transition. Harry Sideris : And I would add, Carly, it is getting better, but we've been able to put some processes in place using our scale and to be able to preplan and preorder to really make sure that we have what we need when we need it to keep our investment plans going. And as we look forward, we're going to continue to do that and partner like Brian mentioned, with our vendors to be able to stay ahead of the curve. But things are getting better, and we're staying ahead of the curve there. Carly Davenport : Got it. That's really helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the balance sheet question. Can you just update us on where you currently stand? And then just relative to the walk that you sort of laid out last quarter, are any of the buckets that bridge the gap of getting to that 14% FFO to debt level changing at all relative to what we saw last quarter? Brian Savoy : Carly, we really update the FFO once a year, but we are making progress with the rate cases from North Carolina being the largest single driver of improving FFO year-over-year. Deferred fuel recovery is also on track. Those rates were updated, the last one happened in December for DEP North Carolina. So all the deferred fuel is on track to be fully recovered by the end of this year. We're issuing the equity, the ATM and DRIP. We did $100 million in Q1, and we'll continue that throughout the year to get to $500 million by the end of the year. And lastly, on the second half of the year, we expect to monetize tax credits from the IRA and that's the last component. So we're tracking exactly where we wanted to be at the end of the first quarter and is looking clear in sight. Operator : And our next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : I just wanted to follow up with the proposed gas additions as you laid out there. Just wondering how you see, I guess, incremental gas flowing into your territories given the difficulties we've seen in building new pipelines in different parts of the country? So just wondering how you think about this at that point? Lynn Good : Jeremy, thank you. Making sure that we have adequate supply for any new source of generation is a part of the assignment. And so we have been at work over the course of 2023 and putting in place agreements that we believe will not only continue to strongly support the existing gas in our area, but also allow us to expand. And this is something that is closely monitored by the North Carolina Commission and will be by Indiana as well as we continue diversification there. But we feel like we've got a credible plan in place, and it will be executed over the number of years, fully recognizing that it takes a lot of work with stakeholders to not only build the generation, but working with our partners who are putting pipeline infrastructure in place to make sure that the stakeholder concerns and needs are being met and so we're confident we've got a plan in place we can execute. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. And then -- maybe just diving into load growth expectations. Just wondering if we could go a little bit further, I think, in the quarter, commercial was up 3.5%, industrials were down 2.5%. If you could touch based on that as well as, I guess, what specific things you see materializing over the balance of the year to accelerate the growth as you talk about a back half of '24 increase? Brian Savoy : Jeremy, it's a good item to talk through. And on the commercial growth, we saw strength across our regions in the commercial sector. Data center growth was a key driver in that in the quarter, and we expect that to continue throughout the year. On the industrial side of things, we have some plants that are retooling for new products. So they're off-line in the first quarter. And they signaled to us that, look, this is a temporary thing, and we're going to be changing our lines and by mid-Q2, late Q2, we're coming back on in full. And we're talking to these customers on a frequent basis to ensure we're there to meet their needs when they need it, and they're tracking on our plan. And we kind of expected this trend to continue because we saw this lag in industrial last year, and we thought by mid-2024, we'd see the tide turn. And then lastly, economic development projects that are coming online in 2024. Those were slated for the second half as well, and those are tracking as planned. So we are on track for our 2% growth in 2024, and we'll keep you apprised as we learn more. Operator : This concludes the Q&A session. So I'll hand the call back over to Lynn Good for any closing remarks. Lynn Good : Thank you, and thanks to all of you. Thanks for your interest in Duke Energy. As always, we're available for follow-on questions, and I appreciate your investment. Thanks for joining today. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, everyone, and welcome to Duke Energy's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. My name is Felicia, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to your host, Abby Motsinger, Vice President of Investor Relations at Duke Energy. Please go ahead, Abby. Abby Motsinger : Thank you, Felicia, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Review and Business Update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair and CEO; along with Harry Sideris, President; and Brian Savoy, CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information. Actual results may differ from forward-looking statements due to factors disclosed in today's materials and in Duke Energy's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation include supplemental information along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Abby, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment and recognize the work of our team responding to Hurricane Debby. The storm made landfall in Florida yesterday morning and caused outages for about 330,000 customers. We had crews in position over the weekend, and our teams are working around the clock to restore power. As of this morning, we've restored 90% of our impacted customers. Based on its current track, we expect the storm to impact the Eastern and Central parts of the Carolinas later this week. Along with tropical storm forced winds, the system is bringing heavy rains. We're staging crews and implementing flood mitigation plans to be able to safely and quickly respond to expected customer outages. Now let me turn to our second quarter results and the significant progress we're making across the company. Our simplified fully regulated portfolio of Southeast and Midwestern utilities combined with our strong track record of constructive regulatory outcomes positions us well to deliver long-term value for shareholders. We have clear growth visibility driven by our $73 billion capital plan, which is focused on grid and generation investments to support the growing communities we serve. In a moment, Harry will provide an update on recent regulatory activity and operational highlights from across the business; and later in the call, Brian will walk through detailed financial results and our long-term sales outlook. But let me begin with the results for the quarter. Turning to Slide 5. Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.18, building on our strong start to the year. These results were $0.27 above last year, driven by growth across our electric utilities and improved weather. We continue to deliver consistent outcomes, carrying positive momentum into the back half of the year. We are reaffirming our 2024 guidance range of $5.85 to $6.10. We are also reaffirming our long-term EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2028 based off of $5.98 midpoint for 2024. With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Harry. Harry Sideris : Thank you, Lynn. Starting on Slide 6. We have a long history of working with stakeholders to achieve constructive regulatory outcomes that benefit our customers and deliver returns for our shareholders. Since the start of 2023, we've continued to build on this track record with approximately $75 billion of rate base investments approved or settled across 7 rate cases. I'm proud of the teams across the company that contributed to these impressive results. The outcomes support essential critical infrastructure investments acknowledging the rising cost of capital through higher ROEs and allow us to meet our customers' demands for affordable, reliable and increasingly clean energy now and into the future. Just last month, we received a final order in our DEC South Carolina rate case and rates were updated August 1. The order supports our efforts to increase system diversity and reliability and enhance the customer experience. We also filed a comprehensive settlement in our Florida rate case in July. The Florida settlement reflects a 3-year multiyear rate plan with rates effective in January. It focuses on continued grid modernization to serve population growth and harden the system as well as investments in renewables. Hearings are scheduled to begin later this month and an order is expected by the end of the year. Importantly, the outcomes in South Carolina and Florida demonstrate our commitment to affordability and continued focus on finding creative solutions to maintain low rates, including utilizing tax benefits to moderate increases. With solutions like these, we expect customer rates to remain below the national average. Turning to Slide 7. We continue to collaborate with stakeholders across our jurisdictions. In the Carolinas, the IRP process is advancing in both states. Our plans calls for a diverse and increasingly clean energy mix that serves our growing customer base while preserving reliability and affordability. In mid-July, we were pleased to reach a constructive settlement in North Carolina with the Public Staff, Walmart and CCBA. Importantly, the settlement adopts our near-term action plan including renewables and natural gas investments as well as early development activities for long lead time resources. Hearings concluded in North Carolina yesterday and South Carolina hearings will start in mid-September. We expect orders in both states by year-end. CPCN hearings will begin today in North Carolina on our request to construct more than 2 gigawatts of natural gas generation. These advanced class units will be located at existing coal plants slated for retirement, ensuring continued reliability in complementing our significant investments in renewables. We expect CPCN orders from the NCUC by the year-end and pending approvals, construction is planned to start in 2026 with all units operational by 2028. Moving to Florida. We placed 3 new solar facilities in service through June. This keeps us on track to have 1,500 megawatts of solar on the Florida system by the end of the year. Looking ahead, we plan to build 12 solar plants between 2025 and 2027, adding another 900 megawatts of clean energy to the Florida grid. We also have 2 additional rate case hearings this quarter. In Indiana, hearings begin later this month; and in North Carolina, our Piedmont Natural Gas hearing begins in mid-September. Both cases are based on investments we've made to serve our customers and strengthen our system over the last several years. Before I turn it over to Brian, I wanted to commend all our teammates for their unwavering focus on operational excellence, ensuring reliable and affordable energy to our customers every day. As Lynn mentioned, many of our teammates are actively working to restore power to our Florida customers impacted by Hurricane Debby. Restoration efforts are well underway, and we are committed to restoring power to all customers as quickly and safely as possible. In addition to responding to storms, this summer, we experienced extreme heat across our jurisdictions. In fact, the Carolinas reached 2 new record summer peaks in a matter of weeks. Our team showed incredible preparation and collaboration across the company. I'm pleased to share that the grid and fleet performed well and our employees met the needs of our customers and communities during these critical times. With that, let me turn the call over to Brian. Brian Savoy : Thanks, Harry, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 8. We had a strong second quarter with reported and adjusted earnings per share of $1.13 and $1.18, respectively. This is up from adjusted earnings per share of $0.91 in the second quarter last year. Within the segments, Electric Utilities & Infrastructure was up $0.34. Growth was driven by rate increases in riders, higher sales volumes and warmer-than-normal weather across our service territories, which is a complete reversal of the extremely mild weather in the second quarter of 2023. Partially offsetting these items were higher interest expense and depreciation. Moving to Gas Utilities & Infrastructure. Results were down $0.02 compared to last year as favorable rider revenue was offset by higher interest expense and depreciation. And finally, the Other segment was down $0.05, primarily due to higher interest expense. Turning to Slide 9. I'd like to take a moment to discuss our earnings profile for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, last year had an atypical earnings shape with record mild weather in the first half of the year, which was mitigated with agility measures in the second half. With that in mind, the strong performance we've demonstrated so far this year is aligned with our planning assumptions. I'm incredibly proud for the team for delivering an impressive first half, and we are on track to achieve full year results within our guidance range. Turning to Slide 10. We were pleased to see weather normal volumes increased 1.9% versus last year, in line with our full year projection. Customer growth remains robust, led by the Carolinas and Florida, which grew 2.4% through the first half of the year. We're also encouraged to see improving residential usage across our jurisdictions. Commercial and industrial volumes were up over 1% versus last year, driven by strength in the commercial sector. Commercial sales volumes have exceeded our projections through the first half, offsetting a slower rebound in industrial sales. As economic development projects continue to come online throughout the second half of the year, we expect C&I load growth to accelerate. We operate in some of the most attractive jurisdictions for both the economic development and customer migration, which provide conviction in our 2% load growth forecast in 2024, and 1.5% to 2% load growth CAGR over the 5-year planning horizon. Turning to Slide 11. We are forecasting unprecedented growth in power demand from advanced manufacturing projects across multiple sectors as well as data centers. As we evaluate which economic development opportunities to include in our forecast. It's important to remember that we take a risk-adjusted approach. We utilize discrete project level analysis to evaluate and probability weight potential opportunities, resulting in a subset of projects being included in our current projections. We have a robust pipeline of projects that continue to progress and will be reflected in our plans when the projects mature. This pipeline provides a runway for growth well into the future. We are committed to serving this new load in a way that prioritizes reliability and affordability for all our customers. To that end, we recently executed MoUs with Google, Microsoft, Nucor and Amazon to explore tailored solutions to meet large-scale energy needs and develop rate structures to lower the long-term cost of investing in clean energy technologies. These voluntary programs, which are subject to commission approval, would be open to any large customer and would include protections for nonparticipating customers. We look forward to continued collaboration with all stakeholders as we work to meet the accelerating demand in our service territories. Turning to Slide 12. We recognize the importance of a strong balance sheet as we advance our strategic priorities and fund investments that will be foundational to our growth. We are on track to achieve 14% FFO to debt by the end of this year, which represents 100 basis points of cushion to our Moody's downgrade threshold. Our constructive regulatory outcomes, combined with the collection of remaining deferred fuel balances, monetization of tax credits and programmatic equity issuances, provide clear line of sight to achieving our target. As disclosed in February, we expect to issue $500 million of common equity annually over the 5-year plan via our DRIP and ATM programs. We've completed over half of our $500 million target, having priced $285 million year-to-date. We've also completed approximately 80% of our planned long-term debt issuances for 2024. As we've demonstrated over many years, our commitment to our current credit ratings and a strong balance sheet is unwavering and will continue to be a top priority as we execute our growth objectives. Moving to Slide 13. We remain confident in delivering our 2024 earnings guidance range of $5.85 to $6.10 and growth of 5% to 7% through 2028. We operate in constructive growing jurisdictions and the fundamentals of our business are stronger than ever. We are well positioned to achieve our growth targets, which, combined with our attractive dividend yield, provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for shareholders. With that, we'll open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Constantine Lednev : It's actually Constantine here for Shar. You highlighted the economic development and growth in kind of the geography is obviously favorable for data center activities, but you're still running on that 1.5%, 2% load growth projections. At what point do you feel you can reassess these assumptions? And what could that mean to the capital plan, just can see some out-of-cycle updates kind of going towards the tail end of the year? Brian Savoy : Thanks, Constantine. It's a great question and 1 that we continue to be encouraged about. So if we dial the clock back, we were -- a year ago, we were projecting 0.5% load growth CAGR over our planning horizon. And then economic development opportunities began to surface and continue to show up, and we moved to 1.5% to 2%. And on a base of sales of over 200,000 gigawatt hours a year at Duke Energy, that 1.5% to 2% CAGR it's quite impressive, and we're very pleased to see that kind of growth. And I would say that with the economic development pipeline we're looking at today, we're trending to the high end of that 1.5% to 2%. And as we look at our plans, we're forecasting to update the full financial plan with the load growth and the capital supported along with the earnings per share outcome from those elements in February, which is our normal cadence. We will definitely keep you updated along the way as the economic development pipeline progresses. But I will say that we continue to be encouraged. And every time we look at our load update, it deepens as far as the load growth outlook. And most of that growth is later in the decade. So it kind of coincides with as we roll the plan to 2029, it will make more sense to show that load growth over time. Lynn Good : Constantine, this is Lynn. The only thing I would just emphasize that Brian touched upon is we have continued to see economic development growth. I know the chart that we've shared with you is consistent with first quarter, but we are continuing to see growth in that economic development pipeline. And so our thought is that we will provide a comprehensive update both on load and capital in February, but continue to give you a sense of economic development progress over the balance of the year. So the bottom line is we have a wealth of growth opportunities and feel like we're really well positioned to take advantage of them. Constantine Lednev : Yes. Sounds great. Totally understood. And maybe separately, can maybe get an update on nuclear PTCs from just a timing and monetization perspective, given some of the importance that they play towards our credit metric targets and any other pieces we should be mindful of? Brian Savoy : Thanks, Constantine, I'll take that as well. This is Brian. On the nuclear PTCs, we were hoping to see guidance by midyear, and that obviously has not transpired. The treasury continues to actively issue guidance on elements of the IRA. We see that week in and week out. And we still expect the formal guidance for the nuclear PTCs by the end of this year. But I will say that we operate 11 very low-cost nuclear plants that have delivered extremely well over the first half of the year. And these plants have earned about $250 million of nuclear PTCs through June. That's recorded in our financial statements. And our plans are to test the market on monetizing these PTCs in the third quarter. So you could expect us to report on that later in the year, but we don't feel like the delay in the guidance from our early expectations will have any impact on our credit in 2024. Operator : The next question comes from Nick Campanella from Barclays. Nick Campanella : Good to see the settlement in Florida. I was just wondering on DEI with evidentiary hearing at the end of this month, do you think you can settle that case ahead of those hearings and how should we think about that potential? Harry Sideris : Thanks for that question, Nick. This is Harry. We're always open to settlement discussions. That hearings later this month as we get closer to that hearing, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to have those discussions. But we also feel very strong about the case that we've put together, strong customer benefits, the investments for the growth in Indiana and the economic development in Indiana. So we feel comfortable either path on a constructive outcome. Lynn Good : So we'll keep you informed, Nick, obviously we get closer to the hearing. But as Harry indicated, a strong case and anxious to move through this process in Indiana. Nick Campanella : That's great. We'll be watching it. And then I guess, just when I think about your roll forward, which I know is not until the fourth quarter, just kind of wondering how you're kind of tracking within this kind of 5% to 7% EPS guide path. When I try to kind of conceptualize some of your sensitivities that you laid out on Slide 22, interest rates are down, you did mention some pressure higher on the 1% to 2% load growth assumption and the stock is also up, which helps the accretion of your equity program. Just where are you tracking in the 5% to 7%? And then like what headwinds should we be kind of considering versus what I outlined right there? Brian Savoy : No, thanks, Nick. This is Brian, again. So as we look through our 5-year plan, we definitely see more tailwinds and headwinds, right? This accelerating load growth that pointed more towards the back end of the plan, clearly provides a tailwind, consistent investment in critical infrastructure across our jurisdictions that are supported and approved by multiyear rate plans or grid riders for multiple years to come provide that transparent growth and a stabilizing interest rate environment. Frankly, those 3 things give us a high degree of confidence in the 5% to 7% at a minimum, extending that, but also presents the opportunity to earn at the top end of that range later in the period. I will say that the things to watch would be an economic downturn, right? That affects any utility. It would affect our communities that we serve and would affect our customer demand. So that's something that we definitely keep our finger on the pulse with our customers, understanding where they are and what pressures they're seeing. But that probably -- Lynn, I don't know if you would add anything to that? Lynn Good : Nick, I would say we are comfortably positioned within the 5% to 7% and feel like it's strongly positioned when you look at this economic development for a sustained period of given you 5% to 7% through '28. As Brian indicated, we see a lot of growth in that '27-'28 period with the economic development pipeline. So that gives us the opportunity to earn at the higher end of the range. If those projects mature at the pace we expect. And if we continue to add them, which has certainly been our experience here in 2024. So we'll continue to update you every step of the way and are anxious to provide an update in February that will not only capture this economic development we've seen in '24, but also give us a chance to update capital. We've produced a lot of cash flow. The balance sheet is strengthening in 2024 as well. So we're very optimistic about the future. Operator : The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Maybe just following up on this focus on industrial growth. I mean, you guys outlined these MoUs here, can you comment to the expense of which that is incremental versus reflected in that projection on load growth in '27-'28? I imagine it's very substantively excluded. And then how do you think about the remaining time line on reaching this MoU finality, if you will? And how do you think about the risk sharing within that, right? I know you mentioned Nucor here, presumably, there's some sort of ability to leverage an SMR directly with some of these counterparties. How do you think about what that structure would look like for you guys? Just to clarify that ahead of time, on your risk dollars relative to ensuring that there's appropriate risk sharing? Lynn Good : Julien, thanks. Let me take a shot. I'm sure Harry and Brian will have something to add to it. So as we think about this economic development pipeline over the period that we've shared with you through '28, data centers represent about 25% of that pipeline. But as we get out to 2030 and beyond, that 25% grows. And so we already see a lot of growth in the economic development pipeline for data centers moving into 2030 and beyond. So I would think about this MoU as not only further catalyzing how we might serve customers that are in the pipeline, but our hope also is that those customers will have an interest in expanding in our service territories as we find a way to continue to meet their needs on sustainability, but also bringing resources on. So the discussions are early. I think there's a clear understanding that we are trying to do a couple of things here. We're trying to meet the load. We're trying to meet their sustainability goals, we're trying to do so in a way that protects retail customers, we're trying to meet their time lines. And I would say the discussion is very constructive. And the notion of risk sharing is something that we're very clear on and have lots of experience in talking with customers about. And so I think those -- that element of the discussion is going well as well. So we'll keep you informed as we start to mature some of these agreements into something that's more definitive, there will be disclosure, and we'll continue to update you on the economic development pipeline as we go. So I'll pause there and see if Harry or Brian has anything he'd like to add. Harry Sideris : I would just add, Julien, the MoU has really amped up the constructiveness of our discussions with these customers and real -- a lot of excitement on their end for these ACE tariffs, the clean energy piece of it. So I think this is going to pay dividends as we work with them closer into the future. Julien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And the idea here being selecting either some kind of SMR offtake or some kind of clean energy offtake that would specifically not impact the customers, just when you think about what the MoU comprises? Lynn Good : Yes. So Julien, when you talk about nuclear, there are a number of structures that we're talking about. They have an interest, obviously, in carbon-free generation and nuclear represents an around the clock option. But we all recognize we're in the early stages of development. So is there a structure? Is there a premium pricing? Is there some method of equity investment? Is there some structure that would encourage the development at a perhaps a more rapid pace or sooner because of the partnership? So all of that is being explored as we talk with them and we're anxious to continue to develop it. . I think the other thing I would note, which Julien, of course, you're aware of this, this generation plan is moving through the Carolinas. A lot of discussion already on carbon-free generation like the SMRs. We would also expect that every element of the agreements that we would reach with the tech companies or Nucor would also go through a commission process to make sure that they're comfortable with the structure. But they have been very positive on the fact that we're exploring these discussions, because it's a win-win for economic development for bringing clean energy to the states and also for doing so in a way that reflects protection of retail customers. Operator : The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to dive back in, I guess, on the load trends as you laid out in the prepared remarks and how commercial and industrial are tracking versus expectations here today and just what you're seeing on the ground as far as that trends over the back half of the year there? Brian Savoy : Yes, Jeremy. So we guided to 2% load growth in 2024, and we're tracking on top of that. The residential growth has been robust. We've added more customers in the first half than in any first half we've looked at in any kind of recent years, about 80,000 retail customers added to our system in the first half of the year, which is putting residential kind of right in line with our 1.5% to 2% growth for 2024. Commercial has been higher than our expectations. And we came into the year thinking a modest growth in commercial, but we've seen much more in the commercial sector. And this is a combination of data center usage, healthcare, universities, just a broad mix of commercial companies that are -- have higher demands and largely supporting this higher population that are in our regions. The industrial sector has not rebounded as fast as we anticipated. We continue to be in dialogue with our industrial customers and they're just taking a cautionary stance. And the fear of recession is out there, you don't want to get overextended. The labor market has been tight. So there's been a challenge to get all the shifts staffed appropriately. So some of our customers have taken the opportunity just to pull back a little bit. They're still signaling a rebound later in '24 or maybe early '25, but we feel like the mix might be a little different, but the growth in '24 is on top or better than our expectations. Lynn Good : Jeremy, the only thing I would add to that is this industrial rebound kind of pushing into later '24-'25 has also been influenced by interest rates, it's what we're hearing from customers. And it's primarily, what I would call, our legacy industries of textile and paper that are feeling the pressure, and we continue to track with all of that industrial volume we're expecting from economic development that is exactly on track. So it's a little bit of an old industry, new industry story that we're seeing in the Carolinas, in particular, and a little bit in Indiana. But overall, we're tracking to the growth for the year. And as we've said many times, feel bullish on the economic development pipeline. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful there. And then just wanted to go to November here. We have elections coming up, North Carolina has [indiscernible] race and just wondering any thoughts you could share with regards to if different outcomes could impact the IRP or just there's a lot of stakeholder agreement here and so you wouldn't expect too much change? Lynn Good : Jeremy, no matter what happens in November, our objective is the same, which is to keep serving our customers well with reliable, affordable and increasingly clean energy. We don't expect that election to have an impact on the rulings we would receive in the Carolinas or in Indiana or Piedmont case. And you should know and just reaffirming that we believe a bipartisan approach working on both sides of the aisle for energy policy has served our companies well -- every utility well over time, and that will continue to be our posture as we move into this election. So Harry, would you add anything on IRP progress? Harry Sideris : Yes. We wrapped up the Carolinas IRP yesterday. In July, we entered into a very constructive settlement with Public Staff and some other intervening parties. And I think that helped speed the process up. It was very efficient. I got to spend some time there last week and the commission was very engaged in providing this energy transition affordably and reliably to our customers, which aligns to what we're doing. So we feel like our plan that we set forth meets the needs of our customers in North Carolina, and we'll work to see an order later this year on that. Operator : The next question comes from Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho. Anthony Crowdell : Just a couple of questions, I guess. You laid it out nice on Slide 6. Harry went over it on the regulatory execution. I'm just curious -- very impressive there. Just curious, has there been a change in the company's regulatory strategy over maybe the last 5 years, given like how strong the outcomes have been in the last 2 years? Or is just -- it's a great track record, and I'll leave it there. Lynn Good : Anthony, thank you for appreciating that. When I think about regulatory outcomes, it is an absolutely every day assignment of Duke Energy, because it includes operational excellence that we serve our customers well reliably and affordably. It also includes work in the legislature to make sure that energy policy is clear and that we have an expectation of how to go in the future. It's stakeholder engagement that includes customers, that includes policymakers, that includes community leaders, et cetera. So I think you saw us undergo a bit of an organizational change a few years ago where we put CEOs of the Carolinas and CEOs of Midwest and Florida, Alex and Julie in place to really continue to fine-tune our approach around stakeholder engagement and clarity around roles and responsibilities in the regulatory area. And it's been a long-standing history at Duke Energy, but appreciating this complex and often polarized environment, we think that additional focus has been helpful to us. And we take the responsibility of serving customers well every day very seriously and that's the first job at Duke Energy. And if we do that well, we believe the company will be treated fairly and constructively in the regulatory environment. And we have the deepest respect for those for the oversight of our commissions and policymakers and work hard every day to serve our customers well and to please those that have that awesome responsibility to keep energy policy moving in our states. Anthony Crowdell : Great. And then on load growth, I mean, obviously, you guys talk about it and I appreciate the language, Brian, you said of moving it, given the Duke footprint of 1.5% to 2%. Given the load growth in the long-lived asset and planning cycle that's required, does the company believe you'll start seeing more frequent IRP filings that whether on a 2- or 3-year cycle that, that might have to condense given the changes that the system is seeing right now? Brian Savoy : It's a good question, Anthony. We have a pretty frequent cadence already on IRPs, which in the Carolinas, it's every other year; Florida, every year and a 10-year site plan and then in the Midwest, there's various time horizons that are pretty frequent as well. But I think that what we did like in Carolinas this year, we had an August filing. We updated it in January, because we saw increasing load growth and we felt the commissions need to see this in real-time. So maybe not a full IRP filing each and every year, but we could see more frequent updates as we learn more about load growth over time to plan the appropriate resources, because you do need plenty of lead time to gear up these generation plans and execute them. Lynn Good : Yes, the only other thing I would add on that notion of updating the IRP is we work very closely with the states on economic development. So it's a partnership between Duke Energy and the economic development engines of each state and so there's a lot of understanding on a part of the state of what's coming and that gives us an opportunity to have on-the-ground discussions about what's needed with transmission and generation and then the IRP, so like the regulatory filings that follow that. So we intend to continue to stay really closely linked with our states as we go forward. Operator : The next question comes from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs. Carly Davenport : Just wanted to quickly follow up on a couple of the previous comments on the Carolinas IRP. Appreciate all the color on the North Carolina process. I guess just as you look towards the South Carolina piece with hearing starting next month, is there any potential for a settlement there as well? Lynn Good : Carly, I appreciate that question. I think it's a little early to tell. We're still in the middle of a procedural schedule in South Carolina, where rebuttal testimony is due in a week or so, there's a surrebuttal process that goes on in South Carolina and then hearings occur in mid-September. And as Harry indicated, we believe the plan that we've put forward in both states meet the requirements of the objectives that both states have set out and as we've said many times, our objective is to give both states the opportunity to put their fingerprints on this plan in a way that serves their needs and continues to deliver the benefits of scale that Duke Energy has offered to customers over a long period of time. So we'll keep you informed as we get deeper into the procedural process, but South Carolina is lagging a bit. Carly Davenport : Got it. Okay. I appreciate that. And then the follow-up was just on the nuclear side. I know you guys made some comments on nuclear before, but could you just refresh us sort of on your latest thoughts on the technology and the timing for new nuclear to potentially have a place in the resource planning process? Lynn Good : Carly, the SMR is included. Harry, do you want to talk a little bit about how we approached it with the IRP? Harry Sideris : Yes, absolutely. In North Carolina, we have included that in our near-term action plans for these long lead item projects like SMRs. We have it slated in our IRP to come online 600 megawatts in 2035 at our Belews Creek station. So we're waiting for approval from the commission to move forward with those actions, to continue the development as we work through technology selection as well as other construction needs, but we have a site selected, and we're working through that process. And this IRP filing has all that in there, and the Public Staff and the settlement has agreed to those items. Lynn Good : And Carly, I would just add, I think you appreciate that Duke has a long-standing nuclear history here in the Carolinas, 11 units. We also have customers in both states that are interested in a sustainable future. We have states who appreciate the economic development that nuclear investment has represented for the communities. So we will work through this in a thoughtful way, but I do believe that continued expansion of nuclear here in the Carolinas could make sense as we get into the 2030s and beyond. And frankly, we're hearing some conversation in Indiana as well on whether nuclear at some point could fit into that program. That, I would say, is probably lagging a little bit on timing, but I think there's a recognition that nuclear could be a part of the future, and we'll manage it in a very disciplined way. Operator : We have no further questions. So I'll turn the call back to Lynn Good for closing remarks. Lynn Good : Well, thank you, and thanks, everyone, for your questions today and for your investment in Duke Energy. We're available, Investor Relations and members of the team for questions if there's any follow-up that we can provide and really appreciate the engagement today and appreciate, as I said, your investment in Duke Energy. Thanks so much. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you all for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Following today's presentation, there will be a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to your host today, Abby Motsinger, Vice President of Investor Relations at Duke Energy. Abby, please go ahead. Abby Motsinger : Thank you, Felicia, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Duke Energy's third quarter 2024 earnings review and business update. Leading our call today is Lynn Good, Chair and CEO along with Harry Sideris, President, and Brian Savoy, CFO. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking information. Actual results may differ from forward-looking statements due to factors disclosed in today's materials and in Duke Energy's SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. With that, let me turn the call over to Lynn. Lynn Good : Abby, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the third quarter results, I wanted to take a moment and recognize the extraordinary hurricane season that we've responded to this year. We've had three consecutive hurricanes : Debby, Helene, and Milton, each of which devastated parts of our communities. And my heart goes out to all of those who are directly impacted by these catastrophic storms, especially those who lost loved ones, homes, or businesses. Harry will provide further details on our restoration efforts in a moment and Brian will share cost estimates and plans for cost recovery later in the call. But I want to first commend our employees and utility partners, many of whom were personally affected by the devastation, for their remarkable response. Our field teams rose to the challenge working around the clock to restore outages as safely and quickly as possible. And our customer care representatives, corporate responders, community relations managers and state President offices worked tirelessly to keep customers and policymakers informed. I'd also like to thank our state and local leaders, including Governor Cooper, Governor DeSantis and Governor McMaster and officials in our emergency operation centers for their partnership and coordination. I could not be more proud of our teammates and our partners for their unwavering commitment to our customers and communities. It's important to note that our regulators and policymakers recognize the extraordinary efforts of our company in responding to these events and the feedback we have received has been overwhelmingly positive. We recognize that our work is not done. It will take time for some of our communities to get back on their feet and we'll be with them every step of the way. Turning to quarterly results on Slide 5. Today, we announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.62 for the third quarter compared to $1.94 last year. Brian will discuss the results in more detail, but I wanted to highlight a few things influencing this comparison. As you know, 2023 was impacted by historically weak weather early in the year and mitigation in the second half of the year. Significant mitigation efforts positively impacted third-quarter 2023 results. Third quarter of 2024 includes the full impact of Hurricane Debby and the mobilization of resources for Hurricane Helene. Helene and Milton will impact the fourth quarter. And for both storms, we're working with preliminary cost estimates which we will finalize by year-end. Hurricane costs are largely deferred or capitalized. However, there are a few exceptions and there's no recovery mechanism for lost revenues. As a result and based on what we know today, we are reaffirming our 2024 guidance range, trending to the lower half. We are actively pursuing mitigation measures, some of which will naturally occur because of the resources devoted to the storms and others we will trigger through controlled spending through the balance of the year. And we will look for every opportunity without compromising on our commitment to safety and to our customers. As we look ahead to 2025 and beyond, we have strong momentum driven by our track record of constructive regulatory outcomes, including our recent IRP approvals in the Carolinas, as well as our robust growth in our attractive jurisdictions. These tailwinds give us confidence in our long-term outlook and we are reaffirming our 5% to 7% EPS growth rate through 2028, up the midpoint of our 2024 range. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Harry. Harry Sideris : Thank you, Lynn. Let me begin on Slide 6, with our response to the historic storm season we faced over the last few months. The devastation in parts of our service territories, including my hometown of Asheville, North Carolina was unlike anything we've experienced before. Over the three hurricanes, we assembled more than 20,000 resources from across the U.S. and Canada and restored approximately 5.5 million outages in some of the harshest conditions. In August, Hurricane Debby entered our service territories near the Big Bend region of Florida as a Category 1 storm. The system then made its way north through our Carolina service territories, bringing high winds, heavy rain, and causing outages for 700,000 customers. We were prepared and restored more than 90% of our customers within 24 hours. One month later, Helene, a Category 4 hurricane made landfall on September 26 and impacted every one of our service territories from Florida to Indiana. The storm brought record-breaking rainfall and flooding, created landslides and washed out roads and towns. In total, Helene led to approximately 3.5 million outages, with the hardest hit areas of Western North Carolina, upstate South Carolina, and the barrier Islands of Florida requiring significant infrastructure rebuild. Less than two weeks after Helene, Hurricane Milton, a Category 3 hurricane made landfall near Sarasota, Florida. The storm affected the majority of our customers in the state and led to over 1 million outages. The St. Petersburg and Tampa Bay areas experienced the worst of the storm with rainfall of up to 16 inches and extensive wind damage. We restored nearly 600,000 customers in 48 hours and 95% of all customers within four days. Our success in responding to storms of this magnitude is due to our strategic preparation ahead of the storms near constant communication with customers and stakeholders, and most importantly, the tireless work of our employees and utility partners. Each of our 27,000 Duke Energy employees has a storm role and the response effort is truly all hands on deck. I want to specifically recognize those on the front lines, our crews who work night and day to restore power, no matter how hard. For example, two Duke Energy line workers hiked through miles of difficult terrain to restore power to the Ashville Veterans Hospital following Helene. And this is just one heroic example of hundreds throughout our response. Our team's dedication and commitment, along with close coordination with local, state, and federal agencies allowed us to make progress faster than we expected. Another key to our successful response was the grid-hardening investments we've deployed across the system. Last year alone, we invested more than $4 billion to harden and modernize the grid. This included targeted undergrounding, pole upgrades to steel and concrete in coastal areas, and self-healing technology. These investments helped avoid nearly 550,000 customer outages in saving 7 million hours of total outage time across all three storms. Going forward, we'll continue to invest in these critical infrastructure assets with grid investments accounting for half of our five-year $73 billion capital plan. Turning to Slide 7, I'll share progress on our near and long-term strategic priorities. In the Carolinas, we are pleased to receive constructive approvals on our Carolinas resource plan earlier this month. The North Carolina Utilities Commission issued an order November 1st, accepting our settlement with public staff and other parties in its entirety. And on Monday, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina issued a directive approving our IRP and recommended portfolio. We expect an order by November 26th. These timely commission approvals allow us to advance our near-term investments while maintaining our share commitment to preserving reliability and affordability as we meet our state's growing demand for power. In Indiana, last week, we filed an updated IRP after an extensive stakeholder engagement process. Our preferred scenario is designed to balance reliability of service and customer affordability. Plans for natural gas assets, renewables, and battery storage also add diversity to our generation resources in the state. As in all jurisdictions, there will be a robust review of all planned resource additions. We expect to file a certificate of public convenience and necessity for new and expanded gas generation at Cayuga station in early 2025. Shifting to Florida, in August, the commission approved our settlement agreement with unanimous support. The three-year multi-year rate plan allows for timely recovery of grid, solar, and battery investments. New rates will be effective in January. We also reached a comprehensive settlement in our Piedmont Natural Gas North Carolina rate case in September, resolving all matters in the proceeding. Investments will focus on federal safety regulations, enhancing the customer experience, and providing safe, reliable natural gas service. We expect an order in January of 2025. With these outcomes, we've settled or received approval for approximately $80 billion of rate-based investments across eight rate cases since the start of 2023. We have multi-year rate plans in place in our largest jurisdictions through the end of 2026, which smooth rate impacts to customers and provide line of sight to growth. These outcomes support essential critical infrastructure investments, acknowledge the rising cost of capital through higher ROEs, and allow us to meet our customers' demands for affordable, reliable, and increasingly clean energy now and into the future. With that, let me turn the call over to Brian. Brian Savoy : Thanks, Harry, and good morning, everyone. As shown on Slide 8, our third quarter reported and adjusted earnings per share were $1.60 and $1.62, respectively. This compares to reported and adjusted earnings per share of $1.59 and $1.94 last year. Within the segments, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure was down $0.09. O&M was higher in the quarter, largely due to unplanned hurricane restoration costs from Debby and Helene. Results were also impacted by lost revenue from storm-related outages and evacuations. As expected, growth from rate increases and riders were partially offset by higher depreciation and interest expense. Moving to Gas Utilities and Infrastructure. Results were down $0.04 compared to last year, mainly due to higher interest expense and depreciation on a growing asset base. And finally, the other segment was down $0.19, primarily due to planned to a planned higher effective tax rate, which reflects tax efficiency efforts realized in 2023. Our 2024 effective tax rate is tracking in line with our full-year guidance of 12% to 14%. Turning to storms, our preliminary total cost estimate for the three hurricanes is between $2.4 billion to $2.9 billion for the year, and we recognized approximately $750 million in the third quarter. Most of these costs will either be deferred for future recovery or relate to capital projects to rebuild portions of the system. We are advancing cost recovery strategies through established mechanisms and have a long track record of constructive outcomes. We're targeting rider recovery in Florida beginning in early 2025 and receipt of securitization proceeds in the Carolinas by the end of next year. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2024, we expect fourth-quarter adjusted EPS to be higher than last year due to growth from rate increases in the electric and gas segments and higher sales volumes. And as Lynn mentioned, we have cost agility initiatives underway to reduce spending, which will drive O&M lower in the fourth quarter compared to last year. We've outlined our fourth-quarter drivers in the appendix of the presentation. With these drivers in mind, we are reaffirming our 2024 guidance range of $585 million to $610 million. Based on what we know today, we are trending to the lower half of the range, primarily due to storm impacts, including restoration costs and lost revenues from record customer outages. Moving to Slide 9. Third quarter weather normal volumes increased 1.1% versus last year, driven by strong commercial volumes and residential customer growth. In the Carolinas, We've added approximately 75,000 residential customers year to date, roughly 10,000 more than the same period last year. And in Florida, We've added nearly 30,000 residential customers, also outpacing last year. We continue to see robust economic development activity and in the past month have signed letter agreements for 2 gigawatts of data centers. These agreements are emblematic of conversations we are having with large customers all around our service territories and represent continued advancement of projects in our pipeline. As a result, we've increased the high end of our 2028 economic development forecast to up to 20,000 gigawatt hours of incremental load. This represents a 2,000 gigawatt hours increase since our second quarter update. As a reminder, we take a risk-adjusted approach as we evaluate which economic development opportunities to include in our forecast. In the near term, we continue to see a slower rebound in certain industrial sectors. We are in frequent dialogue with our largest customers and they continue to signal expectations for a recovery, but the timing has shifted into 2025. Additionally, as with any extreme weather period, third-quarter weather normal volumes likely reflect some impact from the major storms. Overall, we're seeing steady improvement in our rolling 12-month volumes and are trending toward our 2024 load growth target of 2%. And over the long term, we see load growth at the top end of our 1.5% to 2% CAGR through 2028, with annual load growth accelerating in 2027 and 2028 as large economic development projects come online. Turning to Slide 10. We have provided key growth drivers for 2025. We've executed an active regulatory calendar over the past two years that has yielded constructive outcomes and positioned us well as we head into next year. Beginning with the Electric segment, in Florida, we'll implement the new multi-year rate plan with an updated 10.3% ROE in January. In the Carolinas, we'll implement the second year of the North Carolina multi-year rate plans and see a full-year impact from the DEC South Carolina rate case. And in the Midwest, we expect the Indiana rate case to be effective in March. Finally, we'll see retail sales growth from economic development and population migration in addition to increases in rider revenues. In the Gas segment, we'll see growth from the Piedmont North Carolina rate case, integrity management investments and customer additions. We will provide 2025 earnings guidance in February along with updated load growth expectations and our refreshed capital and financing plans. As we signaled, we expect our capital plan to increase as we move further into the energy transition. We also expect capital to increase in the near term as a result of a higher pace of customer additions and refresh cost estimates for generation investments that ramp up in the remainder of the decade. We are well positioned for the opportunities presented by this unprecedented demand growth and we will take a balanced approach to funding the incremental capital, supporting our growth rate and balance sheet strength. Moving to Slide 11. We've made significant progress on credit-supportive initiatives. The constructive regulatory outcomes we've achieved with increasing ROEs and timely recovery of investments have driven considerable improvement in our operating cash flow. And in October, we efficiently monetized nearly $200 million of energy tax credits that will benefit customers over time. We expect additional transactions in the fourth quarter. We've collected over $3 billion of deferred fuel since 2023 and are on track to be at our normal level by year-end. We've also completed over 80% of our planned $500 million equity issuances through the DRIP and ATM programs, having priced $400 million year-to-date. As I mentioned earlier, we will pursue storm cost recovery through established mechanisms in our states, including securitization in the Carolinas and our storm rider in Florida. We expect a temporary credit impact in 2024 and are targeting 14% FFO to debt in 2025, 100 basis points above our Moody's downgrade threshold. In reports issued in October, both Moody's and S&P concurred that the impacts from the storm will not have a long -- any long-term credit implications. As we demonstrated over many years, our commitment to our current credit ratings and our strong balance sheet will continue to be a top priority as we execute our growth objectives. Turning to Slide 12. We operate in constructive growing jurisdictions and the fundamentals of our business remain strong. Our track record of regulatory execution has us well-positioned to achieve our long-term 5% to 7% growth target through 2028, which combined with our attractive dividend yield, provide a compelling risk-adjusted return for shareholders. With that, we will open the line for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Shar Pourreza : Hi, guys, good morning. Lynn Good : Good morning, Shar. Harry Sideris : Good morning. Brian Savoy : Good morning. Shar Pourreza : Morning, morning. Just on -- let me just start on overall credit. Post storms, you guys are still I guess above your downgrade threshold for '25. Where are you right now and what is the FFO impact from the storms? And then on the tax credit monetization side, it's obviously a key source of FFO for you. You guys have guided to a monetization figure this year around $300 million to $500 million. I think you recognized about $200 million. Do you expect to hit the range and where within the range is the market kind of slower to develop? So just an overall credit question would be great. Thanks. Lynn Good : Sure. Brian, why don't you take that? Brian Savoy : Certainly. Good morning, Shar. So on the credit, I mentioned that the storm costs are going to temporarily impact our credit in 2024. And as we recover these costs through established mechanisms in '25 that will be resolved. And as we think about where we're tracking on 2024, I would view us in the high 13s is where we plan on landing and that has some of the financing impacts from $2.5 billion of storm costs that we expect that we incurred in 2024. On the tax credit monetization, we completed $200 million so far and we have contracts in place that we plan on closing in the next month to get to the top half of that range that we signaled earlier this year. So I'd say we're tracking right in line with our expectations. And really all the credit-positive initiatives that we had underway, rate cases going to into effect, fuel recovery, monetizing tax credits, all those are tracking at or above our targets for the year. So we feel really good about where we stand on credit and that's why we have a lot of confidence in our 2025 credit outlook. Lynn Good : And Shar, the only thing I would add\u2026 Shar Pourreza : Got it, Brian. But just - yes. Lynn Good : Yes, I was just going to say we've also been in conversation - yes, as you would expect, we've been in conversation with the agencies and they are completely comfortable with the plan. We had demonstrated success, as you know, in collecting storm costs in both Florida and the Carolinas. So as Brian said, we are on track with every element and we'll execute as you would expect us to. Shar Pourreza : Got it. Just, Brian, if the storms didn't happen, where would your metrics be versus the high 13% range you are now? Brian Savoy : Yes, if storms didn't happen, we'd be at 14%, 14%-plus. Shar Pourreza : Okay, thanks. And then, I know, obviously, we're heading into the typical bigger update on the year-end call, but just I want to get a sense on sort of the load environment. I mean, you guys are still running the 1.5% to 2% figure, which doesn't really jive with what's been going on around the country. So, a lot of your peers have jumped ahead and revised their load growth figures. They're quantifying the impacts and it's actually hitting their numbers. You did slightly, as you highlighted, uptick the economic development figures. I guess maybe just a little bit of it from a trend perspective, what we should expect from Duke? Are you seeing similar trends as what we're seeing around the jurisdictions and do you expect it to potentially be accretive to your numbers? Thanks. Brian Savoy : No, Shar, I think it's a great question. And one, we've kept our CAGR of 1.5% to 2% long-term on load growth and signaling we're trending to the top end of that range and we'll update it in February. And we are trending at the top and we expect that range to move as we look to next year, Shar. Because the economic development opportunities are not slowing down and they're very sizable. We mentioned the 2 gigawatts signed in this quarter, that's just an example of many conversations that are going on that shore up our pipeline and expand it. And so you should expect the load growth to go up as we roll the plan forward. And we will bring that up in February with the Folsom update. Lynn Good : And Shar, I think it's important to\u2026 Shar Pourreza : Okay. Sorry\u2026 Lynn Good : We talked -- yes, we talked CAGR, right? So compound annual growth rate, but as you look at '27 and '28 as depicted on the chart, we are seeing acceleration. And so we'll continue to provide visibility on this. And of course, watch these every step of the way. They also included discounts in them because we're trying to be conservative recognizing that some of these projects can tend to shift to the right. So we're introducing a bit of that as well, and we'll continue to update. So sorry, did you have another\u2026 Shar Pourreza : Got it. So -- no, no, Lynn, there was just a follow-up on what you just said is. So there is some accretive opportunities, I guess, above your current range potentially. Is that kind of the message? Lynn Good : I think that's right, Shar. And if you look at the chart, you can see it kind of sitting in '27, '28. Brian Savoy : Yes. I would just add, the projects that we're talking to customers about today will show up in late '27, '28 and ramp up in the balance of the decade. So you're going to see this kind of burst of activity that will be signing contracts that will come to reality in '27, '28, '29, when we see acceleration of load growth. Shar Pourreza : Okay, perfect. Thank you guys so much. See you in a couple of days. Brian Savoy : Thank you, Shar. Lynn Good : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Jefferies. Please go ahead. James Ward : Hi, guys. You've got James Ward here, instead of Julien. Lynn Good : Hi, Julien. James Ward : How are you? Lynn Good : Good. James Ward : Hi, you got James here. Hi, Harry. Hi, we're looking forward to seeing you this weekend. Brian Savoy : Yes. James Ward : A quick question on FFO to debt. Obviously, when the first hurricane hit, you talked about 10 basis points of impact. Got the negatives there that I think either people will ask about or you've kind of been addressing. I'd like to talk about the tax credit monetizations instead. You monetized $200 million last month in October. You mentioned expecting to monetize more by the end of 2024. How should we think about that potential monetization in terms of the size, the discount that you're seeing, and just for comparability purposes? And how impactful do you think it could be by year-end to FFO to debt? And then as a follow-on, just sort of into next year and that's my question. Thank you. Brian Savoy : That's very good, Julien. This is Brian. I'll take that. So what we're seeing in the tax credit market, it's deepening. And the discounts that we're being able to realize on our tax credits are very attractive. So think about mid-90s or even slightly above. So I think there's a lot of taxpayers that are looking to reduce their tax bill and they're lining up to get high-quality credits from good credit quality sellers, right? So the -- we did $200 million in the past month and we've geared up our process to close the rest this year and the size that we were targeting coming into the year, Julien, was around $300 million to $500 million. We're trending to the upper part of that range, right? And the market has been growing and deepening, and we've not seen any hesitation by buyers. And what that equates to is about 40 basis points to 60 basis points in the FFO to debt, right? And a big chunk of that is nuclear tax credits and there's also some solar PTCs inside of that figure. And as we look to next year, we'll have more of both, right, more nuclear, more solar. And so you see it being accretive to the FFO for a few years to come. James Ward : Got you. Then as just a quick follow-up there, should we be assuming for the 40 to 60, I get to the solar in there as well? But for the nuclear PTCs, should we treat them as all being monetized? So whatever the assumption is that we're modeling in for next year and so I get that in 2030 as well. Obviously, you get the reversal and you're not getting that benefit anymore, just the way the math works as you amortize them back to customers. But for the next few years, should it be one-for-one? You get them, monetize them. Is that the right way to think about it? Plus solar or is there another nuance? Brian Savoy : No, that's the right way to think about it, Julien, yes. Lynn Good : Hi, Julien, you may recall, we have set forth a pretty creative method of retaining these credits for a period of time and then amortizing them to customers over a four-year period. And so that amortization is very modest in '25 and '26. And then we'll get on a path of amortizing about 25% of them as generated in '28 and forward. So all of that is contemplated in our five-year plan and credit. And it's one of those incredible opportunities that not only strengthens credit, but lowers price of our product to customers in a way that I think is really helpful to our growth plans. James Ward : Absolutely. Definitely makes sense. And a final point on the amortization. Could you remind us if that -- it's ingrained via the second settlement for sure for DEC, but just for South Carolina and then for DEP, kind of where does that stand in terms of being formalized? I think we're all using that four-year assumption from the initial case and second settlement, but is that -- has that been further made concrete, I guess? Lynn Good : Yes. And let us provide you with an update on that. But North Carolina is memorialized. In South Carolina, we're deferring the credits for consideration in the future. I think the North Carolina method though is a good planning assumption for the Carolinas and we can get you more details on those specifics, Julien, if that would be helpful. James Ward : Yes, offline. Thank you. Thanks so much. Thank you very much. Really appreciate the color. Brian Savoy : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Nick Campanella from Barclays. Please go ahead. Nick Campanella : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Brian Savoy : Good morning, Nick. Lynn Good : Good morning. Nick Campanella : It's great to see -- good morning. It's great to see Moody's supportive here and I know that there's been really constructive effort on the ground with local constituents as well and dealing with the storm. I guess, you did preview in your prepared remarks, there's going to be higher capital coming in the near term, Brian. And just wondering how you're thinking about the need to pull forward any equity, if at all. You do seem confident on the year-over-year into '25 as well, but just wanted to check on that. Thanks. Brian Savoy : Nick, we have $500 million of equity in our capital plan and our financing plan today per year in the five-year plan. And in February, we'll come up with our new capital plan, which I've signaled will be higher. And there'll be some in the near term and some because 2029 is going to be much larger than 2024. We'll have our full financing plan at that point and provide how we're going to fund that plan then. Right now, I would not signal any additional equity. Lynn Good : What I would suggest, Nick, on\u2026 Nick Campanella : That's great. Lynn Good : On the equity is we -- yes, as we expand capital, we will finance it in a balanced way. I think we've given a range of 30% to 50% of equity related to new and incremental capital. So I think that's a planning assumption that would be appropriate. Nick Campanella : That's great. And then something that's come up on earnings call a bit more this season is just new nuclear. And I know that you've had some exploratory frameworks, whether it's for SMR or otherwise announced a few quarters ago. Could you just maybe talk about how you see Duke participating in new nuclear, whether it's kind of large-scale or small-scale into the end of the decade? That'd be helpful. Thanks. Harry Sideris : Yes, Nick, this is Harry. I'll take that question. We see a lot of promise in SMRs. Our customers and stakeholders are very supportive of it. Our states appreciate the economic development that it provides for the communities that we serve. And recently, some of our large tech companies are showing great interest in new nuclear. At the same time, it's a decision we continue to closely evaluate to make sure that it's in the best interest of our customers and our investors as we move forward. In our current IRP plans that just got approved, both North Carolina and South Carolina approved the early development activities and we will continue to follow their lead as we move forward. But any decision as we move forward, we'll have to address three key items. The first one is the first of the kind risk that exists, really around the maturity of the technology, the supply chain. The second item is cost overrun protection to protect our investors and our customers. And then our third is to make sure that we can protect our balance sheet for making these investments. So we'll continue to work with our commissions as we look forward to making a decision there. Nick Campanella : Hi, I appreciate it, and I'll see you guys soon. Thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you, Nick. Harry Sideris : Thank you. Operator : Next question we have comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Durgesh Chopra : Hi, good morning, team. Thanks for giving me time. Just, hey, Brian. Lynn Good : Good morning. Durgesh Chopra : Hi, good morning, Lynn. Brian, can I just ask you to clarify, what is the earnings impact, the combination of restoration costs and lost revenues from the three hurricanes? What does that impact in 2024? Brian Savoy : Yes, Durgesh, you could think about it. We plan for storms in a year, but we don't plan for the historic storm season we just experienced in the past two months. And the restoration costs that would lead to the O&M and the P&L, a few cents of that as well as a few cents of lost revenues because we had 5.5 million customers out for multiple days. So that's how I think about it, few cents each on the O&M for the storm costs that were kind of out of bounds with what our normal level would be and the lost revenues. Lynn Good : And, Durgesh, I would point to, if you look at the drivers for the third quarter, you see us with O&M greater than third quarter of '23. That's largely impacted by storm expense. And then, if we look at the fourth quarter, the majority of -- a large amount of restoration for Helene sits in the fourth quarter as well as Milton, all of Milton. And so the revenue -- expected revenue impact from outage will impact the fourth quarter as well. So when we look at it in total, it's both of these things that are really driving us to be below target in the range. But you should know, as you've seen us do many times, we will do everything we can to mitigate this. And that's the posture that we're assuming here for the fourth quarter and have a high degree of confidence that we will constrain the hurricane impact to 2024. And so our optimism around 2025 and the growth that this company offers to investors remains unchanged. Durgesh Chopra : That's very helpful. Thank you. And maybe just talking to that growth, Lynn, I mean, I think in the Q2 call and obviously, earlier today you reaffirmed the 5% to 7% on the Q2 call. I just want to be clear. You talked about perhaps getting to the higher end of that 5% to 7% EPS growth at the back end of the plan. Is that still sort of the way you are projecting that growth to trend? Lynn Good : Durgesh, it's really -- that is a good question and it is really consistent with the conversation we just had with Shar around load growth. So when you look at '27 and '28 and that chart that sort of has a bit of a slope to it and you see us deeper into the energy transition with increasing capital, that's what we're pointing to is the potential we have to get higher in the range. So we're working hard in that direction and believe we've got the potential and the constructive regulatory outcomes that we've been delivering time and time again really underpin our confidence. Durgesh Chopra : Okay. Thank you again for taking my questions. Operator : Next question comes from Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Anthony Crowdell : Hi, good morning, Lynn, good morning, Brian, and good morning, Harry. I want to leave you out. Apologies. I guess just quickly, just after Durgesh's question which I think followed up on Shar's question and he talked about maybe at the end of the decade, maybe leaning towards the higher end of the EPS CAGR. Any thoughts with the load growth and also when you look at these historic storms or maybe widening the credit cushion that you guys have and maybe using the load growth and the enhanced earnings growth of making a wider cushion beyond the 150 basis points you're working on now? Lynn Good : Anthony, it's a good question and something we spend a lot of time thinking about and we'll be working in that direction and thinking also planning for some more contingency around storms and our annual planning will also be a part of that. So as you would expect us to do, we've learned from every one of these events and 2024 will be no exception. Anthony Crowdell : And just have one follow-up. And I don't know if you've quantified it. Just you're talking about additional maybe mitigation measures for the fourth quarter, has the company quantified what they expect from a normal run rate to a pull out of fourth quarter? Lynn Good : We haven't quantified something specifically, Anthony, and I want you to know that there's a ton of work going on, but we're only about two weeks past Hurricane Milton. So we're working. And when we talk about our range and the expectation we've set for the full year, that implies that we are going to keep going. And we actually believe that the quantification of the mitigation could put us in a position where O&M is lower than '23. But I don't want to get any more specific than that given where we are in the process. Anthony Crowdell : Great. Thanks for taking my questions, and I'll see you guys in Hollywood. Brian Savoy : Thank you. Lynn Good : Thank you. Brian Savoy : See you, Anthony. Operator : The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go-ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. This is actually [Aiden Kelly] on for Jeremy. Just wanted to dive into the -- hey, how's it going? Just wanted to dive into the 2 gigawatts of incremental data center growth a bit further. Was this comprised of several large single or multiple customers? And then could you confirm whether Microsoft's land acquisition in North Carolina is embedded in this forecast or maybe incremental here? Brian Savoy : Ian, it's a good question. The 2 gigawatts right now, this work is confidential, so we're not going to share the customer information. But I will say when we sign letter agreements. What that means is the customer has a site identified and land secured either through options or purchased. And what happens next is that we will negotiate with that customer over the next eight to 10, 12 months on the Energy Service Agreement. And that codifies what the contract will be between us serving that customer and what that customer will pay for its energy. And so you'd expect all these details to come out over the next year. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this is emblematic of what we're seeing across the board. We're talking to many customers in this arena and I'm not going to talk specifically about Microsoft's acquisition of land, that was in an article recently. But we're having talks with many customers and they're very serious about citing their data centers in the Carolinas specifically because in the Carolinas over half our energy is carbon-free nuclear. And that's very attractive to the data centers. So we see this as a great opportunity for us and we're seeing it come to reality as we sign agreements like these. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And then maybe just any thoughts on how election results could impact your resource mix and generation portfolio? Maybe specifically regarding coal plant retirements or renewables additions? And then could you talk about any industries that could be impacted in your territory by maybe manufacturing, restoring and give any incremental load growth in your forecast from this? Lynn Good : I'll take that one, Ian. We're digesting election results and looking at both federal and state, I think congratulating -- I want to extend congratulations to President Trump on his work and really look forward to working with his administration on our task of delivering affordable, reliable power. I think the U.S. economy will be a focus and a priority of his and our industry plays an incredibly important role. So as we look at what we're doing here in the Carolinas and also Indiana and Florida, we are putting infrastructure in place in order to serve economic development and believe there are lots of opportunities to work together. And similarly, with our states, we had two gubernatorial elections, one in Indiana, one in North Carolina. The governors in both states are people we know well who understand the important role that the utility plays in investing in infrastructure and driving growth. And so we're anxious to work with those administrations as well. And, I think our conviction around delivering affordable and reliable energy is something that will resonate in our states and also at the federal level. Unidentified Analyst : Appreciate the color there. And then just maybe one more, if I could add it in, could you just quantify roughly per year how much in transferability you're seeing? Brian Savoy : On the energy tax credits, Ian? Unidentified Analyst : Yes, correct. Brian Savoy : We signaled 40 basis points to 60 basis points of FFO to debt improvement from these tax credit sales in 2024, and that equates to about $300 million to $500 million of monetized tax credits in a year. And so you could think about it in that kind of range for the next several years. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Appreciate all the color there. I'll leave it there. Thanks. Lynn Good : Thank you. Brian Savoy : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Carly Davenport from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. John Miller : Hi, good morning, guys. This is actually John Miller on for Carly. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe to start on the Indiana IRP, can you maybe talk about what's new in that updated filing and then kind of what the total opportunity there looks like now? Harry Sideris : Yes, I'll take that one, John. We filed our IRP last week in Indiana. We've been working with stakeholders for many months on that plan. It really is transitioning our Cayuga plant to gas, adding storage and solar, really diversifying the fuel supply we have in Indiana and also working through our Gibson facility and what we're going to do there in the future. So very broad stakeholder support for our plans. We will be filing the CPCN at the Cayuga plant at the beginning of next year and expect to be moving forward with the plan in the IRP as we progress into next year. John Miller : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe on the Carolinas IRP with the North Carolina order deferring some natural gas to next year for the next resource plan. I guess, one, when in 2025, do you expect to file that resource plan and then how should we think about the size of it? Will it be a smaller filing or could it be similar in size to the outstanding resource plan? Harry Sideris : So we're very pleased that we got the IRPs approved earlier last week and this week, both in North Carolina and South Carolina, very constructive orders. It really allows us to move forward with our near-term actions that we have in both states. We will be filing updates to those plans next year, but don't anticipate a tremendous difference in what we're planning. We're really focused on those near-term actions in advancing the items that we've put in place there, very constructive work with stakeholders as we move forward. We have our CPCNs for some of the gas generations that we expect to hear back from by the end of the year as well to proceed with those constructions projects at Person County. John Miller : Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. Harry Sideris : Yes. Operator : We have no further questions, so I will hand back the call to Lynn Good for closing remarks. Lynn Good : Great. Well, thank you all, and we'll see you in a couple of days. Looking forward to the EEI Financial Conference. I want to thank you for your questions and for your investment in Duke Energy. Talk soon. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",
